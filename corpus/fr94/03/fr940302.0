Importation of Potatoes From Canada 


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are removing the foreign quarantine notices and the regulations concerning the importation of potato plants and
tubers from Canada that were established to prevent the introduction of the necrotic strain of potato virus Y (PVY

n

) into the United States. The United States and Canada have agreed upon a PVY

n

 management plan that relies on seed potato testing and certification. It is our judgment that implementation of the
Canada/United States PVY

n

 Management Plan will protect U.S agriculture from potential risks imposed by PVY

n

, and that Federal regulations that apply to potatoes from Canada with respect to PVY

n

 are no longer necessary. This final rule relieves unnecessary and burdensome restrictions on the importation of
potatoes from Canada.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The regulations in 7 CFR 319.37, ``Subpart_Nursery Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, Seeds, and Other Plant Products''
(referred to below as the nursery stock regulations) govern the importation of living plants, plant parts, and seeds
for or capable of propagation, and related articles. 
The regulations in 7 CFR part 321 (referred to below as the regulations) restrict the importation of potatoes from
foreign countries to prevent the introduction into the United States of injurious potato diseases and insect pests.

On December 20, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 66305&hyph;66307, Docket No. 93&hyph;021&hyph;2) a proposal to amend the regulations by removing the foreign
quarantine notices and the regulations concerning the importation of potato plants and tubers from Canada that were
established to prevent the introduction of the necrotic strain of potato virus Y (PVY

n

) into the United States. We explained in the proposal that protection against PVY

n

 would be provided through the implementation of the Canada/United States PVY

n

 Management Plan (referred to below as the management plan), which relies on seed potato testing and certification
as an alternative to the current quarantine notices and regulations involving the importation of potatoes from Canada.

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending January 19, 1994. We received 7 comments
by that date. They were from a farmers exchange, tobacco cooperative, and representatives of State and foreign governments.
All responses fully supported the management plan and removing the current quarantine notices and regulations.
Commenters stated they feel the provisions of the management plan are sufficient to protect the seed potato and tobacco
industries from infection with PVY

n

 and will not be burdensome to U.S. producers. In addition, they requested that the change be made effective as quickly
as possible now that the shipping season for potatoes from Canada is in progress. This will avoid the unnecessary burden
of the need for import permits and phytosanitary certificates. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule. 
This final rule does not affect other restrictions on the importation into the United States of potatoes grown in Canada.




Effective Date 



This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. The shipping season for potatoes from Canada is in progress. Making this
rule effective immediately will allow interested producers and others in the marketing chain to benefit during this
year's shipping season. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
Canadian imports of potatoes to the United States vary from year to year depending upon market conditions in both countries.
Canadian potato-producing provinces produced only approximately 8.5 percent as many potatoes as were produced
in the United States in 1992, prior to the imposition of our March 2, 1993, interim rule, which relaxed earlier restrictions
by requiring certification of certain potatoes imported into the United States from Canada based on surveys performed
by Agriculture Canada. Canada is also a major export market for U.S. potatoes. 
U.S. imports of Canadian potatoes declined between 1990 and 1992. This decline in imports did not result in increased
prices of these products in the United States. Domestic prices are influenced more by the volume of U.S. production.
Statistics indicate that a slight increase or decrease in imports would have very little or no effect on domestic prices
since the volume of imports is small compared to U.S. production. In addition, potato demand and supply are not highly
responsive to price changes.

Although the effects would be minimal, the entities that may be most affected by this rule include U.S. potato producers,
importers, and processing plants. Although it is not possible to determine the total number of entities within these
categories which can be classified as small entities, over 64 percent of all potato growers and 94 percent of U.S. fruit
and vegetable processing firms could be considered small by Small Business Administration guidelines. The negative
impact on U.S. producers due to increased imports is likely to be small since U.S. prices are more influenced by domestic
production and market conditions than by imports. Any negative impact is likely to be offset by a positive impact upon
importers, exporters, potato processing firms, and consumers. The increased availability of Canadian potatoes
will benefit potato farmers, shippers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers as well as potato processing firms.
Consumers will be positively affected by slightly lowered prices. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule allows potatoes to be imported into the United States from Canada. State and local laws and regulations regarding
potatoes imported under this rule will be preempted while the vegetable is in foreign commerce. Fresh potatoes are
generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce
until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed
on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and this rule will not require administrative
proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.).

ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 29, 1993, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued an interim rule to the regulations for the livestock
emergency programs, which are authorized by the Agricultural Act of 1949 as amended, and the CCC Charter Act. The interim
rule, provided an amended and simplified method for determining the value of livestock feed needs. Other minor changes
to update the regulations included changes in weight ranges and an appropriate amount of energy required to provide
the daily maintenance needs for dairy goats; determining pasture value; applying the $50,000 payment limitation
to crop year rather than calendar year; and calculating interest on refunds due CCC. This rule adopts as final the interim
rule published on November 29, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12866 



This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information complied by the Department,
it has been determined that this final rule: 

(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency:

(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 
(5) Would not raise novel, legal, or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule since the CCC is not
required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the
subject matter of these determinations. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 



Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of the final rule do not
preempt State laws and are not retroactive to 1992 and prior crop years. Before any judicial action may be brought regarding
the provisions of this regulation, the administrative appeal provisions set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted.




Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115
(June 24, 1983). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments to 7 CFR part 1475 set forth in this final rule will not result in any change in the public reporting burden.




Background 



An interim rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62510 which amended 7 CFR part 1475 to provide for administering CCC's livestock emergency
programs. 

The interim rule amended &sect;1475.3 to modify the definition for dairy cow ``weight ranges'' and to add a weight
range for dairy goats in the table. 

The interim rule amended &sect;1475.6: 

(1) Paragraph (c), to change the reference from CCC&hyph;653 to CCC&hyph;651; 
(2) Paragraph (e)(4), to clarify the manner in which pasture value is actually calculated for 1991 and subsequent
crop years; 
(3) Paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A), to change the method for determining the value of livestock feed needs; and 
(4) Paragraph (i)(2)(iii), to correct a misprint in the 

Federal Register

. 

The interim rule amended &sect;1475.10(b) to clarify when the emergency livestock feed program may be suspended
or terminated in a contiguous county. 

The interim rule amended &sect;1475.17(a), (c), and (g) to clarify what type of interest will be charged on refunds
to CCC. 

The interim rule amended &sect;1475.22 to change the payment limitation from ``calendar'' year to ``crop'' year.

The interim rule provided for a 30-day public comment period which ended on December 29, 1993. No comments were received
during the comment period. 

Accordingly, under the authority of 7 U.S.C. 1427, and 1471&hyph;1471j and 15 U.S.C. 7146 and 714c, the interim rule
amending 7 CFR part 1475, which was published at 58 FR 62510 on November 29, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




History




On September 10, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign
J&hyph;29 from the Bangor, ME, VORTAC (BGR), to the Halifax, Canada, VOR/DME (YHZ) (58 FR 47680). Interested parties
were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA.
No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that
proposed in the notice. Jet Routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet route listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.




The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations realigns J&hyph;29 from the Bangor, ME, VORTAC, to the
Halifax, Canada, VOR/DME. Realigning J&hyph;29 will improve operations and expedite the flow of air traffic to the
Canadian airspace.


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class E Airspace at Yampa Valley Airport, Hayden, Colorado. The airspace was described incorrectly,
using a magnetic radial instead of a true radial, and cited the Yampa Valley Airport instead of the Craig Moffat Airport.
Therefore, controlled airspace as depicted on aeronautical charts does not currently encompass the instrument
approach procedure at the Craig Moffat Airport. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has
discontinued use of the term ``transition area'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.''

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments on the Rule




Although this action is in the form of a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are
invited on the rule. The FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available information to review
the regulation. If the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to
amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



History



The Hayden, Colorado, Class E airspace was designated to contain an instrument approach procedure in controlled
airspace from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth at Craig Moffat Airport. It was incorrectly published
under the Yampa Valley Airport title, and the airspace information incorrectly lists a magnetic radial instead of
a ``true'' radial. Accordingly, neither the airspace designation nor the aeronautical chart depiction reflect
the controlled airspace. Currently, IFR pilots are not afforded controlled airspace in which to conduct instrument
flight rules procedures to the Craig Moffat Airport. Similarly, VFR pilots do not have correct references for controlled
airspace.

Any matter which adversely affects aeronautical safety requires immediate corrective action in the interest of
flight safety. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary
to public interest, and the FAA finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C., 553(d) for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area.

Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A

The Rule



This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Hayden, Colorado, Class E airspace, which
was designed to provide controlled airspace for an instrument approach procedure at Craig Moffat Airport. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this regulation_(1) is not
a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation
as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures
and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This final rule establishes NWS criteria for taking certain modernization actions such as commissioning new weather
observation systems, decommissioning outdated NWS radars and evaluating staffing needs for field offices in an
affected area; and its criteria for certifying that closing, consolidating, automating, or relocating a field office
will not degrade service to the affected area. A notice of proposed rulemaking (published December 6, 1993, 58 FR 64202)
set forth the proposed criteria for those actions except for automating and closing field offices. The criteria for
those two actions require further development and, after notice, public comments, and consultation with the Committee
and NRC will be published in final form before either of these actions take place. All final criteria will be set forth
as Appendix A to the basic modernization regulations at 15 CFR part 946 promulgated at 58 FR 64088.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Section 704 of the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992 (Act) requires the NWS to contract with the National Research Council
(NRC) for a review of the scientific and technical modernization criteria by which the NWS proposes to certify, under
section 706 of the Act, actions to close, consolidate, automate, or relocate a field office and the preparation and
submission of a report assessing these criteria. The NRC prepared this report and submitted it to the Secretary of
Commerce on July 28, 1993. The NRC endorsed the criteria proposed, with certain reservations about some of the criteria
that relate to the commissioning of Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) and automation certification. 



Section 704(b) of the Act requires the NWS to publish the final criteria in the 

Federal Register

, based on the NRC report, after providing an opportunity for public comment, and after consulting with the NRC and
the Modernization Transition Committee (the Committee). The public comment period closed January 5, 1994. There
was one comment received. This was submitted by the National Weather Service Employees Organization (NWSEO). Consultation
with the Committee was completed on January 13, 1994. The Committee reviewed the public comment and offered one recommendation
to be added to the criteria. Consultation with the NRC was completed on February 23, 1994.

The major comments were as follows: 



Comment 1_

NWSEO stated that the criteria do not contain ``statistical and analytical measures'' for determining that there
will be no degradation of service but rather are merely ``process criteria.'' 



Response_

The commentor is incorrect in stating that the criteria are merely process criteria. The criteria for each action
contain the necessary analytical and performance measures. The criteria for consolidation contain measures for
evaluating each of its component and subcomponent elements, often in exhaustive detail. These include measures
to ensure that the new radar is commissionable, e.g., adequate operations and maintenance personnel, adequate backup
capability, system availability of at least 96 percent; and that the old radar can be decommissioned. The criteria
for relocation include a checklist to ensure that each element of the move will be considered in advance and can be completed
without degrading services. The NRC found these criteria to be adequate to determine that no degradation would result
from these actions.

<DOCNO> FR940302-0-00010 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940302-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commentor advocates use of 

post hoc

 statistical verification measures for every type of certifiable action. Such a regime is impractical. For example,
in the case of a relocation, it is impossible to collect statistical data from the new office location until the old
office has been relocated there, and the office relocation can not legally occur until a relocation certification
has been approved; yet the certification would be dependent on the statistical data.

As contemplated by NWSEO, such a regime would impose extensive delays and costs on the modernization and clearly would
be unreasonable. Statistical data must be collected over a long period of time after the restructuring actively has
taken place to be statistically valid. The minimum time period that would be acceptable would be 1 year after the certifiable
event.



Comment 2

_The NWSEO contends that any relocation also constitutes a closure and, therefore, the criteria should be the same.



Response

_Congress specifically listed four separate types of actions that are to be certified and clearly stated that one,
closures, could not take place until 1996. This scheme is clearly understandable. The proposed interpretation of
NWSEO would effectively eliminate a ``relocation'' as a separate category of certifiable action. Relocation of
an office is distinctly different from closure of an office. In the case of relocation, the same office continues to
exist, albeit in a different location. The office continues to provide the same products and services to the same users
in the same service area. In the case of a closure, the office ceases to exist as an entity; the responsibility for providing
products and services and the service area is reassigned to another office, or split up among several other offices.
Also, as the commentor notes, this interpretation would preclude the NWS from relocating any office until 1996. The
legislative history of Public Laws 100&hyph;685 and 102&hyph;567 make it clear that one of Congress' overriding
concerns was with the closure of offices as the NWS field office structure shrinks from 250 to 116. Before the new Weather
Forecast Office (WFO) takes on full responsibility for its new larger area, statistical verification is appropriate.
In the case of a relocation, no such considerations are present.



Comment 3

_NWSEO comment states that the evidence from previous office moves is not an appropriate basis for certifying that
relocating the Redwood City office will not lead to any degradation of service.



Response

_In essence, this comment repeats the arguments discussed above_the NWS cannot relocate this office until it has
statistical verification and not until at least 1996 after AWIPS is installed. The NWS disagrees for the reasons stated.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940302-0-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940302-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NWS agrees that it is important to identify those analogous previous office moves that will be relied upon for evidence.
Primarily, these are the offices that were moved in their entirety, although experience in moving other offices in
stages may be useful with respect to certain aspects of the relocation and, therefore, that evidence may be relevant.
Offices that have been moved in their entirety were: The Washington WSFO, which was moved from Camp Springs, MD, to
Sterling, VA; the Philadelphia WSFO which was moved from Philadelphia, PA, to Mount Holly, NJ; and the Ann Arbor WSFO,
which was moved from Ann Arbor, MI to White Lake, MI. The evidence from these moves will be considered as part of the relocation
certification. 

The comment that these moves are within a ``local commuting area'' (a concept that was not even in existence at the time
of one of these moves) and may involve different climatological conditions completely misses the point_there simply
is no difference between the existing office and the relocated office in terms of the data that is received, the equipment
and staff that processes it, the products and services that are disseminated, and the way they are disseminated, except
perhaps where the telecommunications services are obtained from a different company. The evidence from these previous
moves demonstrates that the NWS is capable of making the necessary technical changes so that the relocated office
will operate identically and provide identical services. 



Comment 4

_The NWSEO states ``no new technology is involved in relocation actions''. 



Response

_At the time of the actual relocation from Redwood City, CA, to Monterey, CA, no new technology will be involved. The
Redwood City office will be moved in its entirety, including all existing equipment, to Monterey. The commentor is
correct however, that ``the new facility at Monterey will have NEXRAD and eventually AWIPS'', since Monterey will
become a WFO. These later steps could involve a consolidation or closure. This illustrates that a relocation is a distinctly
different action than a consolidation or closure, which will involve new technology. Certifications of such consolidation
or closures will include evidence based on the use of the new technology. 



Comment 5

_The NWSEO commented that ``the criteria proposed by the NWS contains no measure of service quality, nor any indication
that service quality will be measured as part of the certification process.'' 



Resonse

_For a consolidation certification, criteria 2, User Confirmation of Services, measures service quality from the
user perspective. After services have been transferred to the NEXRAD office, but prior to the consolidation action,
confirmation that services have not been degraded is obtained from users in the affected service area. Since this
is impractical for relocation certification, evidence from other completed office moves is used as a measure of service
quality. 



Comment 6

_The Committee recommended that section IIA3 be amended to include that there would be no degradation of service.




Response

_the NWS agrees and has changed that section accordingly. 



A. Classification Under Executive Order 12866 



This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



These regulations set forth the criteria for certain modernization actions such as commissioning new weather observation
systems, decommissioning outdated NWS radars, and evaluating staff needs at a field office and the criteria for certifying
certain modernization actions such as consolidating and relocating a field office, will not result in a degradation
of service to the affected area. These criteria will be appended to the Weather Service Modernization regulations.
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration when these criteria were proposed, that this action will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. These final criteria are intended for internal agency use, and the impact
on small business entities will be negligible. The final criteria does not directly affect ``small government jurisdictions''
as defined by Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



These regulations will impose no information collection requirements of the type covered by Public Law 96&hyph;511,
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 



D. E.O. 12612 


This rule does not contain policies with sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 



E. National Environmental Policy Act 


NOAA has concluded that publication of the final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. A programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) regarding NEXRAD was prepared in November 1984, and an Environmental Assessment
to update the portion of the EIS dealing with the bioeffects of NEXRAD non-ionizing radiation is being reviewed.

PART 946_MODERNIZATION OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE



1. The authority citation for part 946 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 Title VII of Pub. L. 102&hyph;567, 106 Stat. 4303 (15 U.S.C. 313 note).





2. An Appendix A is added at the end of part 946 to read as follows:



Appendix A to Part 946_National Weather Service Modernization Criteria


I. Modernization Criteria for Actions Not Requiring Certification


(A) Commissioning of New Weather Observation Systems


(1) Automated Surface Observation Systems (ASOS)




Purpose:

 Successful commissioning for full operational use requires a demonstration, by tests and other means, that the ASOS
equipment, as installed in the field office, meets its technical requirements; that the prescribed operating, maintenance,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 23, 1992 (57 FR 10028), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 9B4157) had been filed by PCI Membrane
Systems, Ltd., Laverstoke Mill, Whitechurch, Hampshire RG28 7NR, England. The petition proposed that the food additive
regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of the reaction product of 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride
with piperazine and 1,2-diaminoethane as a food-contact layer of reverse osmosis membranes.


 FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use for the polymeric
reaction product of 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride with piperazine and 1,2-diaminoethane as the food-contact
layer of reverse osmosis membranes is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive
will have the intended technical effect and therefore, &sect;177.2550 (21 CFR 177.2550) should be amended as set
forth below.
  In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
  The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. 
  Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before April 1, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute

ACTION: 

Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal
Liability (29 CFR part 2647) establishes procedures under which covered multiemployer pension plans may adopt rules,
subject to PBGC approval, for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, and establishes standards
for PBGC approval of such rules. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 directs the PBGC to prescribe
such procedures and standards. The amendment allows covered multiemployer pension plans to develop their own rules
for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, and also provides less restrictive time limits on employer'
applications to plans for abatement of complete withdrawal liability.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 



Section 4203 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), sets forth
the circumstances under which an employer is deemed to have completely withdrawn from a covered multiemployer pension
plan. The amount of complete withdrawal liability is calculated under section 4211. Section 4207(a) requires the
PBGC to provide by regulation for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability in the event that an employer
that has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute
under the plan, to the extent that the PBGC determines that reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability is
consistent with the purposes of ERISA. Section 4207(b) requires the PBGC to prescribe by regulation a procedure and
standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal
liability in the event that an employer that has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under
the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent such rules are consistent with the purposes
of 
ERISA.

The PBGC's regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability (29 CFR part 2647; see also 29 CFR 2640.6)
provides rules requiring pension plans to reduce or waive complete withdrawal liability under ERISA section 4207(a).
However, the regulation has not heretofore provided a procedure for pension plans to adopt alternative rules for
reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under ERISA section 4207(b).

When the PBGC originally proposed the regulation on Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, the PBGC
was not prepared to propose rules under section 4207(b). The PBGC believed at that time, however, that ``it is important
to provide the relief contemplated under section 4207(a).'' (49 FR 8036.) Consequently, the PBGC decided to propose
and issue rules under section 4207(a) at that time and to promulgate rules under section 4207(b) at a later date.

On October 23, 1992, the PBGC published (at 57 FR 48348) a proposed amendment to the regulation on Reduction or Waiver
Of Complete Withdrawal Liability. The provisions of the proposed amendment included a procedure for pension plans
to adopt alternative rules for reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability, requirements for a plan sponsor
to submit a written request for PBGC approval of a plan amendment adopting rules for the reduction or waiver of complete
withdrawal liability, a description of the information to be submitted to the PBGC for its review of the request, the
standards for PBGC approval of the request, a safe harbor period of at least fifteen days from the date of resuming covered
operations for an employer resuming covered operations to file its application for abatement of complete withdrawal
liability, and an editorial change to expand the purpose of part 2647 to cover both section 4207(a) and section 4207(b)
of ERISA. All of these provisions were discussed in the preamble to the proposed amendment. No written comments were
received on the proposal, and the PBGC is adopting the amendment as proposed.



Compliance With Rulemaking Guidelines



The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect
in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public
health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

Under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PBGC certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pension plans with fewer than 100 participants have traditionally
been treated as small plans. This rule affects only multiemployer plans covered by the PBGC. Defining ``small plans''
as those with under 100 participants, they represent less than 6 percent of all multiemployer plans covered by the
PBGC (118 out of 2000). Approximately 500,000 employers contribute to multiemployer plans, most of them small employers
(under 100 employees). The PBGC estimates that fewer than 10,000 (2 percent) of these employers are required to pay
complete withdrawal liability in any year, and an even smaller percentage subsequently resume their participation
under a plan and thereby become subject to these rules. Therefore, the PBGC waives compliance with sections 603 and
604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The collection of information requirements contained in this rule (viz., in &sect;2647.9) have been reviewed and
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 under
control number 1212&hyph;0044. The PBGC estimates that not more than ten plans per year will make submissions under
&sect;2647.9 and that each submission will take one-quarter hour to prepare and submit. The total estimated annual
burden resulting from this collection of information is thus not more than two and one-half hours. Comments concerning
the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden should be directed to the Office of
the General Counsel of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation at the address set forth above and to the Office of
Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Desk Officer for Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, Washington, DC 20503.



List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2647

In consideration of the foregoing, the PBGC amends 29 CFR part 2647 as follows:

covered operations. *&blank;*&blank;* Upon receiving an application for abatement, the plan sponsor shall determine,
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, whether the employer satisfies the requirements for abatement
of its complete withdrawal liability under &sect;2647.4, &sect;2647.8, or a plan amendment which has been approved
by PBGC pursuant to &sect;2647.9.

 *&blank;*&blank;* 



* * * * *



4. Section 2647.9 is added to read as follows:



&sect;2647.9 

Plan rules for abatement.



(a) 

General rule.

 Subject to the approval of the PBGC, a plan may, by amendment, adopt rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal
liability under conditions other than those specified in &sect;&sect;2647.4 and 2647.8(c) and (d), provided that
such conditions relate to events occurring or factors existing subsequent to a complete withdrawal year. The request
for PBGC approval shall be filed after the amendment is adopted. A plan amendment under this section may not be put into
effect until it is approved by the PBGC. However, an amendment that is approved by the PBGC may apply retroactively
to the date of the adoption of the amendment. PBGC approval shall also be required for any subsequent modification
of the amendment, other than repeal of the amendment. Sections 2647.5, 2647.6, and 2647.7 shall apply to all subsequent
partial withdrawals after a reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability under a plan amendment approved
by the PBGC pursuant to this section.

(b) 

Who may request.

 The plan sponsor, or a duly authorized representative acting on behalf of the plan sponsor, shall sign and submit the
request.

(c) 

Where to file.

 The request shall be addressed to the Case Operations and Compliance Department, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026.

(d) 

Information.

 Each request shall contain the following information:

(1) The name and address of the plan for which the plan amendment is being submitted and the telephone number of the plan
sponsor or its duly authorized representative.

(2) The nine-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned to the plan sponsor by the Internal Revenue Service
and the three-digit Plan Identification Number (PN) assigned to the plan by the plan sponsor, and, if different, the
EIN and PN last filed with the PBGC. If no EIN or PN has been assigned, that should be indicated.

(3) A copy of the executed amendment, including_

(i) The date on which the amendment was adopted;

(ii) The proposed effective date; and 

(iii) The full text of the rules on the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability.

this section has been given to all employers that have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee
organizations representing employees covered under the plan.

(e) 

Supplemental information.

 In addition to the information described in paragraph (d) of this section, a plan may submit any other information
that it believes it pertinent to its request. The PBGC may require the plan sponsor to submit any other information
that the PBGC determines it needs to review a request under this section.

(f) 

Criteria for PBGC approval.

 The PBGC shall approve a plan amendment authorized by paragraph (a) of this section if it determines that the rules
therein are consistent with the purposes of the Act. An abatement rule is not consistent with the purposes of the Act
if_

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62070), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Day-Glo Color Corp., 4515 St. Clair
Ave., Cleveland, OH 44103, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E04181 to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend
40 CFR 180.1001(d) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylonitrile-styrene-hydroxypropyl
methacrylate copolymer when used as an inert ingredient (pigment carrier) in pesticide formulations applied to
growing crops only.


Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The comment addressed the use of the inert in pesticide formulations.
The commenter requested that the Agency amend the use statement to read ``dye, coloring agent'' instead of ``pigment
carrier.'' Because this chemical is not a dye but rather a polymeric resin which can be used as a pigment carrier, the
Agency denied the request and the proposed use statement will remain as is.
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 29, 1990 (55 FR 26752), EPA issued a notice which announced that Consep Membranes, Inc., of Bend, OR, had submitted
a pesticide petition (PP OF3851) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation for exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance (under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346(a)),
for codlure, [(E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol], in or on all raw agricultural commodities.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated.
The mammalian toxicological data considered in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include
an acute oral toxicity study in rats, an acute dermal toxicity study in rats, an acute intratracheal toxicity study
in rats, a primary eye irritation study in rabbits, a primary dermal irritation study in rabbits, a dermal sensitization
study in guinea pigs, and an Ames mutagenicity assay.
The results of these studies showed no significant toxic effects. When male and female rats were dosed orally at 5,050
mg/kg, minor effects including piloerection, diarrhea, salivation, nasal discharge, epistaxis, and polyuria
occurring immediately following dosing were observed. All symptoms disappeared within 3 days after dosing. (Toxicity
Category IV). When male and female rats were dosed dermally at 2,020 mg/kg in a single application, one of the females
showed decreased defecation and diarrhea, whereas males showed no effects. No deaths occurred and no gross pathological
findings were reported for any animals (Toxicity Category III). Male and female rats exposed to 2.5 mL/kg codlure
via the intratracheal route gained weight during the course of the study. Only minor clinical signs of toxicity were
observed, i.e., decreased activity, chromodacryorrhea, constricted pupils, epistaxis, nasal discharge, salivation,
and respiratory gurgle. No deaths were reported and upon necropsy, no compound-related findings were observed (Toxicity
Category III). The primary eye irritation study demonstrated resolution of conjunctival redness by day 7 and resolution
of chemosis and conjunctival discharge by 72 hours in rabbits (Toxicity Category III). The primary dermal irritation
study in rabbits resulted in primary dermal irritation scores of 2.5 (mildly irritating) and 3.3 (moderately irritating)
at 72 and 96 hours, respectively (Toxicity Category III). The dermal sensitization study (Buehler) indicated that
the codlure pheromone is not a dermal sensitizer. The Ames mutagenicity assay indicated up to cytotoxic levels that
in the presence or absence of S9 activation, codlure showed no evidence of mutagenic activity in 

Salmonella typhimurium

.
Reference Dose (RfD) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition because
the data submitted demonstrate that this insect pheromone showed no significant adverse effect to laboratory animals
in any test. Because no tolerance level is set for this insect pheromone, the requirement for an analytical method
for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of a tolerance is not necessary
to protect the public health. Therefore, the permanent exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established
with the following conditions:
a. Application shall be limited solely to codlure dispensers that conform to the following specifications:
1. Commodity exposure must be limited to inadvertent physical contact. The design of the dispenser must be such as
to preclude any exposure of its components to the raw agricultural commodity (RAC) or processed foods/feeds derived
from the commodity due to its proximity to the RAC or as a result of its physical size. Dispensers must be of such size
and construction that they are readily recognized post-application.
2. The dispensers must be applied discretely, i.e., placed in the field in easily perceived distinct locations in
a manner that does not prevent later retrieval. This exemption does not apply to codlure applied in a broadcast manner
either to a crop field plot or to individual plants.
b. A codlure dispenser is a single-enclosed or semi-enclosed unit that releases codlure into the surrounding atmosphere
via volatilization and is applied in a manner to provide discrete application, i.e., in easily perceived distinct
locations in a manner that does not prevent later retrieval of the codlure into the environment.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after the date of publication of this document
in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20.
A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed withthe Hearing Clerk should also be submitted to: Public Response
and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of
the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied
by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the
factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of
any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator
determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there
is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve
one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary;
and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action
requested. 40 CFR 178.32. 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 11, 1992 (57 FR 8658 -8659), EPA issued notices which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. box 18300, Greensboro,
NC 27419, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 1F4016 and PP 2F4039) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.414 by establishing
tolerances, under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the insecticide
cyromazine (

N

-cyclo-propyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) plus its major metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine)
in or on the raw agricultural commodities leafy vegetables crop group at 10.0 ppm and cucurbit vegetables crop group
at 2.0 ppm.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to these notices of filing.
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. A discussion of the
toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance as well as a discussion of the risk of cyromazine and its
metabolite melamine can be found in a rule (FAP 2H5355/P344) published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 27, 1984 (49 FR 18120); in the Notice of Conditional Registration for Larvadex 0.3% Premix, published in the


Federal Register

 of May 15, 1985 (50 FR 20373) and in the proposed rule regarding the establishment of a tolerance for residues of cyromazine
and its metabolite melamine, calculated as cyromazine, in or on mushrooms at 10.0 ppm in the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34972).
A chronic dietary exposure/risk assessment for the proposed use on cucurbit vegetables and leafy vegetables (except
Brassica) based on tolerance residue levels of 2.0 ppm and 10.0 ppm, respectively, was performed. This chronic analysis
compared exposure estimates to a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.0075 mg/kg/ body weight/day based on a no-observable-effects
level (NOEL) of 0.75 mg/kg body weight/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is based on a 6-month dog feeding
study which demonstrated decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution
(TMRC) from established tolerances for cyromazine utilizes 30% of the RfD for the overall U.S. population. With the
inclusion of leafy vegetables (except Brassica) and cucurbit vegetables, dietary risk is raised to 60 percent of
the RfD. Therefore, the contribution of the leafy vegetables (except Brassica) and cucurbit vegetables tolerances
takes up an additional 30 percent of the RfD. Further, with the inclusion of the leafy vegetables (except Brassica)
and cucurbit vegetables, the estimates for the total percent RfD occupied for infants aged less than 1 year and children
1 through 6 years of age become 44% and 66%, respectively. Since the exposure estimates are based on theoretically
maximum residues, and are typically overestimates of actual exposure, and since they do not exceed the Reference
Dose, the chronic dietary risk of cyromazine does not appear to be of concern. 
The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood for the purposes of these tolerances. An adequate analytical
method, high-pressure liquid chromatograph with UV detection, is available for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II).
There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat of livestock and poultry
since there are no livestock or poultry feed items asssociated with this action.
Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of the tolerance by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances
are sought and capable of achieving the intended physical or technical effect. Therefore, the tolerance is established
as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy Section 404 Permit Program Approval 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; approval of State program.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of New Jersey has submitted an application under section 404(g) of the Clean Water Act for the approval of
a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into certain waters of the United States within the
State. After careful review of the application and comments received from the public, the Agency has determined that
the State's program to regulate discharges of dredged or fill material meets the requirements of section 404(h) of
the Act. Therefore, this application is approved.

 

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This approval will become effective at 1 p.m. eastern daylight time on March 2, 1994. The incorporation by reference
of certain publications listed in this approval is approved by the Director of the Federal Register, as of 1 p.m. on
March 2, 1994, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., hereinafter the ``CWA'') established the section 404 Permit Program,
under which the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps),
may issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States at specified disposal
sites. Section 404(g) of the CWA provides that the Governor of any state desiring to administer its own individual
and general permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (other than
those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible for use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement
as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce shoreward to the ordinary high water mark, including all waters
which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to their mean high water mark, or mean higher high water mark
on the west coast, including wetlands adjacent thereto) within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator
of the USEPA a full and complete description of the program it proposes to establish and administer under State law,
including a statement from the State Attorney General that the laws of the State provide adequate authority to carry
out the described program. The Administrator is required to approve such submitted program unless the program does
not meet the requirements of Section 404(h) of the CWA. Among other authorities, the State must have: 



(1) Adequate authority to issue permits which comply with all pertinent requirements of the CWA, including the guidelines
developed under section 404(b)(1); (2) adequate authority, including civil and criminal penalties, to abate violations
of the permit or the permit program; and (3) authority to ensure that the Administrator, the public, any other affected
State, and other affected agencies, are given notice of each application for permit and are provided an opportunity
for a public hearing before a ruling on each such application. The regulations establishing the requirements for
the approval of the 404 Permit Programs were published at 53 FR 20764 on June 6, 1988 (40 CFR parts 232 and 233). 

On June 15, 1993 the State of New Jersey completed the submission of an application under section 404(g) for EPA approval
of a program administered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy (NJDEPE) to regulate
the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States within the State. On July 9, 1993 EPA published
notice of its receipt of the application, requested public comments, and scheduled three public hearings on the State's
submission (FR Doc. 93&hyph;16307). The public hearings were held throughout the state on August 10, 11, and 12, 1993.


After careful review of this application, I have determined that the State of New Jersey's Program submitted by the
NJDEPE to regulate discharges of dredged or fill material meets the requirements of section 404(h) of the CWA, and
hereby approve it. The effect of this approval is to establish this program as the applicable regulatory program under
the CWA for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States in New Jersey that are not presently
used, or susceptible for use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport commerce
shoreward to the ordinary high water mark, including wetlands adjacent thereto. 
Since this approval, in large part, simply ratifies State regulations and requirements already in effect under State
law, EPA is publishing this approval, effective immediately. This will enable New Jersey to begin immediately regulating
discharges of dredged or fill material under the Federally approved program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background






Auerodendron pauciflorum 

was first discovered by Mr. Roy Woodbury in 1976 in the limestone hills of Isabela in northwestern Puerto Rico. It was
later described by Alain Liogier in 1982. This was also the first record of this genus in Puerto Rico.



Auerodendron pauciflorum 

is an evergreen shrub or small tree which may reach up to 5 meters in height. The leaves are opposite or subopposite,
ovate to ovate-elliptic, 6 to 15 centimeters long and 3.5 to 6 centimeters wide, glabrous, and with minute black glandular
dots. Paired ovate-triangular, ciliate stipules, 1.5 millimeters long, are present at the base of the petiole. The
peduncles vary from 5 to 7 millimeters in length. Two to three flowers are borne in the leaf axils. The calyx tube is broadly
campanulate, 2 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide. The fruit is unknown at the present time (Proctor 1991).



Auerodendron pauciflorum 

is restricted to the semi-evergreen forests (subtropical moist forest life zone) of the limestone hills of Isabela
in northwestern Puerto Rico at elevations of less than 100 meters. Only 10 individual plants are known from the edges
of these limestone cliffs (Proctor 1991). Hills in the area were destroyed for the construction of the existing Highway
2. The area is privately owned and presently under intense pressure for rural, urban and tourist development. The
construction of a resort development, including 7 hotels, 5 golf courses, 36 tennis courts and 1,300 housing units
is proposed for the area.



Auerodendron pauciflorum 

was included as a Category 1 species (species for which the Service has substantial information supporting the appropriateness
of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened) in the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice of review. A proposal
to list 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 as endangered was published on March 18, 1993 (58 FR 14541).

Summary of Comments and Recommendations



In the March 18, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties' were requested to submit
factual reports of information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate agencies of
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Federal agencies, universities and other interested parties were contacted and
requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting general public comment was published in the San Juan Star on April
4, 1993. Two letters of comment were received and are discussed below. A public hearing was neither requested nor held.

The Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources supported the listing of 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 as an endangered species. It stated that the species is only known from one site, the type locality, and is a member of
a genus which consists of only seven species endemic to the West Indies.

Dr. Duane Kolterman and Dr. Gary Breckon, of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, also supported the listing
of the species as endangered. They stated that the species is one of the rarest plants in Puerto Rico and that an additional
threat is the construction of transmission towers for the cellular telephone industry.



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species



After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that 

Auerodendron pauciflorum 

should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act
(16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1).
These factors and their application to 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 Alain are as follows:



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range





Auerodendron pauciflorum

 is found on privately owned land currently subject to intense pressure for rural, urban and tourist development.
Hills in this area were destroyed for the construction of Highway 2. A large resort complex is currently proposed for
the area and many hills are being utilized for the construction of transmission towers. Limestone hills are continuously
being leveled for the production of construction material. These factors, as well as random cutting and the harvesting
of yams, have contributed to the decline of the species and continue to threaten the remaining individuals.



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Taking for these purposes has not been a documented factor in the decline of this species.



C. Disease or Predation



Disease and predation have not been documented as factors in the decline of this species.



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has adopted a regulation that recognizes and provides protection for certain Commonwealth
listed species. However, 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 is not yet on the Commonwealth list. Federal listing provides immediate protection and enhances its protection and
possibilities for funding needed research.



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



One of the most important factors affecting the continued survival of this species is its limited distribution. Because
so few individuals are known to occur in a limited area, the risk of extinction is extremely high. The fruit has not been
described and seedlings have not been observed in the field.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 as endangered. Only 1 population consisting of 10 individuals is known to exist. Deforestation for rural, urban,
and tourist development are imminent threats to the survival of the species. Therefore, endangered rather than threatened
status seems an accurate assessment of the species' condition. The reasons for not proposing critical habitat for
this species are discussed below in the Critical Habitat section.



Critical Habitat



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this species at this time. The number of individuals of 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 is sufficiently small that vandalism and collection could seriously affect the survival of the species. Publication
of critical habitat descriptions and maps in the 

Federal Register

 would increase the likelihood of such activities. The Service believes that Federal involvement in the areas where
these plants occur can be identified without the designation of critical habitat. All involved parties and landowners
have been notified of the location and importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species'
habitat will also be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 jeopardy standard.



Available Conservation Measures



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, Commonwealth, and private
agencies, groups and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation
with the Commonwealth, and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are
initiated by the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against
certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service. No critical habitat is being proposed for 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

, as discussed above. Federal involvement may occur through the funding of residential developments by agencies
such as the Farmers Home Administration.

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented
by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport it in interstate or foreign commerce in the course
of commercial activity, sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove it from areas under Federal
jurisdiction and reduce it to possession. In addition, for endangered plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100&hyph;478)
to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging
or destroying of endangered plants in knowing violation of any Commonwealth law or regulation, including Commonwealth
criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and Commonwealth conservation agencies.

The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits for 

Auerodendron pauciflorum

 will ever be sought or issued, since the species is not known to be in cultivation and is uncommon in the wild. Requests
for copies of the regulations on listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits should be addressed
to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington,
Virginia 22203 (703/358&hyph;2104).



National Environmental Policy Act



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
