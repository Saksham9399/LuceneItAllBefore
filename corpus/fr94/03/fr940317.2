ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service, USDA will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the effects of alternative
plans for developing the Category III portion of Vail Ski Area. Vail Ski Area is located on the Holy Cross Ranger District
of the White River National Forest and operates under a Forest Service special use permit.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Vail Ski Area operates on the White River National Forest, Holy Cross Ranger District, and is located about 100 miles
west of Denver, Colorado. The Category III area encompasses the upper (eastern) portion of the Two Elk Creek watershed
and comprises the southern extent of the special use permit boundary. It is approximately 4,000 acres in size. 



The proposal consists of two parts. The first includes a request to construct 3 ski lifts, one restaurant, 2 picnic
facilities, and provide about 1,000 acres of lift-accessed ski terrain. The ski terrain would be composed of about
equal portions of existing open bowls, gladed trails through trees, and traditional runs cut in more dense, forested
areas. A system of service road/ski-ways would be constructed to circulate skiers and provide construction and maintenance
access. The area is currently closed to public motorized use and would remain so. 

In the second part of the proposal, Vail Associates, Inc. has proposed construction of lift in a mostly developed portion
of the ski area called Tea Cup Bowl. Construction of several ski trails and a short section of road would also be associated
with the Tea Cup lift. For both the Category III and Tea Cup projects, implementation is proposed to begin 1995 and would
span several summers. 

The proposed project is consistent with prior agency decisions and plans. The area is included in the Rocky Mountain
Regional Guide (1983, Revised May 1992) as a Category 1 priority for future ski area development study. The 1984 White
River National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan EIS and Record of Decision allocated this area to management
emphasizing developed alpine skiing. Finally, an Environmental Assessment prepared in 1986 examined a proposed
Master Development Plan for the entire Vail Ski Area. In the Decision Notice approving this Master Development Plan,
the Forest Service authorized additions to the permit boundary and provided site-specific approval for construction
of developments on much of the special use permit area. However, the Decision Notice required further environmental
analysis for the Category III area following submission of a detailed development plan. 

The proposed action is intended to improve existing ski conditions at Vail Ski Area, address skier preferences for
bowl and gladed skiing opportunities, and better distribute skiers, particularly during the critical Christmas
to New Year's Day period and when unfavorable weather or snow conditions prevail in the existing Back Bowls. As well,
action is needed to respond to a request which would implement previous land allocation decisions. 

Public participation will be fully incorporated into preparation of the EIS. The first step is the scoping process
during which the Forest Service will seek information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies,
and other individuals or groups who may be interested or affected by this action. This information will be used in preparation
of the EIS. Scoping includes inviting participation, determining the project's scope, and identifying potential
issues. The public will also be invited to participate in developing the alternatives and identifying and reviewing
the potential environmental effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. 

Preliminary issues associated with this proposal include effects relating to elk habitat, habitat for North American
lynx, biological diversity, non-motorized recreation, wetlands, water quality, maintaining quality skiing opportunities,
and the demand for additional skiing opportunities. As well, there are concerns regarding parking and transportation
in the Town of Vail. The process will examine these and other issues. This analysis will focus on key issues and eliminate
from detailed study insignificant issues or those which have been addressed in previous environmental review. 

Alternatives will be developed and examined which respond to the significant issues and which are consistent with
the purpose and need for the action. Tentatively, the alternatives include the applicant's proposal (described
above) and No Action, which assumes that no development will be allowed. Additional preliminary alternatives include:
the proposal outlined in Vail's 1985 Master Development Plan, which included additional trail development and a
modified version of Vail's current proposal which would include less trail development. These alternatives will
be modified as a result of public scoping. In the EIS, the direct and indirect effects of each of the alternatives, together
with effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions will be evaluated.

The lead Agency in the preparation of the EIS is the Forest Service. The process will also include consideration of
designating cooperating agencies. Among those who may become cooperating agencies are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Implementation of this proposal may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
The Forest Service anticipates the Draft EIS will be filed in the Fall of 1994, and the Final EIS in the Spring of 1995.
The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 60 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the
notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewers position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact
statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be
waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

 Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice (1) reaffirms an earlier policy statement, published on June 26, 1986, concluding that livestock and
poultry involved in biotechnology experiments are subject to current regulations relating to eligibility for slaughter
at official establishments, (2) reaffirms an earlier policy statement, published on December 27, 1991, concluding
that livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments are transgenic research animals and, therefore,
are subject to existing regulations for livestock and poultry used for research, (3) advises that the Food Safety
and Inspection Service (FSIS) will inspect for human food use livestock and poultry which were involved in biotechnology
experiments, and (4) announces the availability of a document prepared by FSIS entitled ``Points to Consider for
the Evaluation of Transgenic Animals from Transgenic Animal Research'' (Points to Consider).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FSIS is responsible for ensuring the safety, wholesomeness, and accurate labeling of all meat, meat food products,
and poultry products under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq., 

and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), 21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq. 

Livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments to introduce genetic improvements by transgenesis,
i.e., transgenic research animals, may be offered for slaughter for food purposes in official establishments. Agency
review and approval in accordance with 9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75 are required before these transgenic research animals
may be slaughtered for human food use at official establishments. In addition, persons who intend to slaughter transgenic
research animals or their progeny for human food use at official establishments may obtain a copy of the Points to Consider
document, and follow the voluntary guidelines set forth in that document. Persons who follow both the applicable
regulations cited above and the Points to Consider document should note that the inspector in charge (IIC) may still
deny or withdraw the approval to slaughter transgenic research animals for human food use when the IIC deems it necessary
to assure that products prepared at the official establishment are not adulterated, in accordance with the FMIA and
the PPIA. The approval to slaughter commercially produced, nonresearch transgenic animals will be handled separately
at a later date.




Currently, trangenesis is usually conducted by injecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into fertilized eggs to achieve
desired genetic and/or physical changes. This procedure results in only a small proportion of animals being born
with genetic changes. Animals born without genetic change may be used for human food under current policies set forth
in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) June 26, 1986, policy statement published in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 23336) which states that existing regulations would be applied to food animals involved in biotechnology experiments.
Also, USDA's policy for the inspection for human food use of livestock and poultry which are involved in biotechnology
research but which are not genetically modified products of biotechnology, published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 67054) on December 27, 1991, concerns transgenic research livestock and poultry in which genetic change has
not occurred. Due to the small number of transgenic research animals produced in biotechnology experiments, such
transgenic research animals have not been presented for slaughter in the past. However, FSIS anticipates that production
of such transgenic animals will increase. This notice reaffirms USDA's June 26, 1986, and December 27, 1991, notices,
specifically with regard to animals involved in biotechnology experiments.

Because of the high level of public and Congressional interest in biotechnology, FSIS is advising in this notice the
actions it will take to ensure that meat, meat food products, and poultry products derived from livestock and poultry
involved in biotechnology experiments are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. This document also provides
guidance to those using biotechnology to produce genetic changes in livestock and poultry and offering the same for
slaughter at official establishments.

This notice announces the availability of the Points to Consider document, which discusses FSIS policy for the food
safety assessment of transgenic animals and their progeny and sets forth voluntary guidelines regarding the presentation
of transgenic research animals and their progeny for slaughter for human food use at official establishments. For
the purpose of this Points to Consider document, which may be updated as needed, without notice, transgenic animals
are animals whose genetic composition has been changed by introducing selective genes (e.g., recombinant DNA),
whether or not the change physically manifests itself. This definition includes animals developed by antisense,
amplification, and deletion technologies. Individuals interested in performing transgenic animal research and
presenting such animals for slaughter may obtain the most recent copy of the Points to Consider document from the address
identified in footnote 1 in this notice prior to starting his or her research. 
Under 9 CFR 309.17 and 9 CFR 381.75, an investigator interested in presenting transgenic research animals for slaughter
should submit data or a summary evaluation of the data to FSIS. When assessing the human food safety of meat, meat food
products, and poultry products from transgenic research animals. FSIS may utilize the recommendations adopted
by the Transgenic Animal Working Group of the USDA's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee. These
recommendations are described in the Points to Consider document. 
Upon receipt of all the data or the summary evaluation of data, FSIS will review and assess the data or summary evaluation
of the data. The data or summary of the data must demonstrate that the research conducted on the transgenic research
animals will not result in the products of the transgenic research animals or their progeny being adulterated. Further,
the Administrator of FSIS, or the Administrator's designee, must approve the slaughter of transgenic research animals
at official establishments prior to slaughter. Transgenic research animals approved for slaughter at an official
establishment are subject to the same inspection procedures as other animals offered for slaughter at official establishments.

Dr. Judith A. Segal, Director, Policy Evaluation and Planning Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 720&hyph;7773.


Background


Federal inspection of meat and poultry products prepared for sale or distribution in commerce or in States designated
under section 301(c) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 661(c)) and section 5(c) of the Poultry Products
Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 454(c)) is required by law and administered by the Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS). However, section 301(c)(2) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 661(c)(2)) and section 5(c)(2) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 454(c)(2))
state that the general requirement of routine Federal inspection ``.&blank;.&blank;. shall not apply to operations
of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores .&blank;.&blank;. when conducted at any retail store
.&blank;.&blank;. for sale in normal retail quantities .&blank;.&blank;. to consumers. .&blank;.&blank;.''

FSIS regulations (9 CFR 303.1(d) and 381.10(d)) define retail stores that qualify for exemption from routine Federal
inspection under the FMIA or PPIA. Under the regulations, for an establishment to be an exempt retail establishment
depends, in part, upon the percentage and volume of its trade with consumers other than household consumers, such
as hotels, restaurants and similar institutions. Accordingly, the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations state in terms of dollars the maximum amount of meat and poultry products which may be sold to nonhousehold
consumers if the establishment is to remain an exempt retail establishment. During calendar year 1993, the maximum
amount for meat products was $37,800; for poultry products, the amount was $33,100. 
The Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR 303.1(d)(2)(iii)(

b

) and 381.10(d)(2)(iii)(

b

) further provide that the dollar limitation on product sales by retail stores to consumers other than household consumers
will be automatically adjusted during the first quarter of each calendar year whenever the Consumer Price Index,
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Department of Labor, indicates a change during the previous year
in the price of the same volume of product exceeding $500, upward or downward. The regulations also require that notice
of the adjusted dollar limitation be published in the 

Federal Register

. 
The BLS Consumer Price Index for 1993 indicates an average annual price increase in meat products of 3.0 percent and
an average annual price increase in poultry products of 4.2 percent. When rounded off to the nearest $100, the price
increase for meat products amounts to $1,100 and the price increase for poultry products amounts to $1,400. As a percentage
of the existing dollar limitation, change in excess of $500 is indicated for both meat and poultry products. 
Accordingly, FSIS, in accordance with &sect;&sect;303.1(d)(2)(iii)(

b

) and 381.10(d)(2)(iii)(

b

) of the regulations, has automatically raised the dollar limitation of permitted sales of meat products from $37,800
to $38,900 and raised the dollar limitation of permitted sales for poultry products from $33,100 to $34,500.

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Questionnaire for Building Permit Official.


Form Number(s): 

SOC&hyph;903.


Agency Approval Number: 

0607&hyph;0125.


Type of Request: 

Revision of a currently approved collection.


Burden: 

209 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

835.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

15 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Bureau of the Census uses the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official in conjunction with the Survey of Housing
Starts, Sales, and Completions (OMB number 0607&hyph;0110). Data collected in the Survey of Housing Starts are used
to produce statistics on residential construction and are needed by economic policymakers to monitor this sector
of the economy. Census field interviewers use the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official to obtain information
on the operating procedures of a sample of the building permit issuing offices in the United States in order to locate,
classify, list, and sample building permits for residential construction. This information is used to carry out
the sampling for the Survey of Housing Starts and to verify and update the geographic coverage of permit offices. In
calendar years 1995&hyph;96, we plan to automate the data collection by replacing the paper questionnaire with laptop
computers.


Affected Public: 

State or local governments.


Frequency: 

On occasion.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.


OMB Desk Officer:

Court Decision and Suspension of Liquidation on Certain Softwood Lumber Products From Canada 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of court decision and suspension of liquidation. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 7, 1994, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) binational panel (the Panel) affirmed the U.S. Department
of Commerce's (the Department) determination on remand that no subsidies were provided on U.S. imports of softwood
lumber products from Canada. Article 1904.13 of the FTA provides that a government may request a review of a Panel decision
by an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC). 



The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has announced that it will file for an ECC review of the
Panel's decision. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC. 

In accordance with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) decision in 

Timken Company 

v. 

United

 this proceeding.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

 March 17, 1994.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber products are subsidized
(57 FR 22570). The Commerce decision was appealed under Chapter 19 of the FTA. The Panel issued an adverse decision
on May 6, 1993, finding that the Department had not demonstrated that countervailable subsidies existed, and remanded
the case to the Department for further deliberations. The Department completed a redetermination and on December
17, 1993, the Panel issued a second adverse decision, finding that the Department still had not supported its determination
that countervailable subsidies existed. It ordered a second remand, requiring the Department to find that there
were no subsidies. The Department complied with this order, and filed its second redetermination, on January 6, 1994.
The Panel affirmed this redetermination on February 23, 1994 and issued a Notice of Final Panel Action on March 7, 1994.
USTR has until April 6, 1994 to file a request for an ECC review. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with the 

Timken 

decision, the Department must publish notice of a decision of the Panel which is not ``in harmony'' with the Department's
final determination. The Panel's March 7, 1994 decision constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's
affirmative subsidy determination. Accordingly, the Department is publishing this notice. The 

Timken 

decision also held that the Department must suspend liquidation pending a ``conclusive'' court decision in the action.
Therefore, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise until the ECC issues
a conclusive decision in this action. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC.

</ADDRESS>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq.

) and the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216).


The applicants request authorization to approach, harass, observe, and feed Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (

Tursiops truncatus

) in the wild in Corpus Christi Bay, for purposes of public display. It should be noted that on October 14, 1993, the NMFS
published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 53320) a Proposed Rule to Revise Regulations for Public Display, Scientific Research and Enhancement Permits
which would clarify that public display activities may occur in captive settings only. Thus, if this rule becomes
final as proposed, it will not provide for conduct of the type of activity being requested by the applicants.
In addition, NMFS regulations define the term ``take'' as including feeding wild populations of marine mammals due
to increased incidental interactions with commercial fishing vessels, alterations in feeding behaviors and migratory
patterns, and vulnerability to disease transmission. [See Final Rule published in the 

Federal Register

 March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11693&hyph;97).]

Decision and Order 



In the Matter of: Goodman Manufacturing Company. (Case No. F&hyph;067) 



Background 



The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B. 

The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its applicance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1994, Goodman's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition.
58 FR 8608. Goodman also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on
February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994. 
No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Goodman Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Goodman. 


Assertions and Determinations 


Goodman's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 40-second
blower time delay when testing its GMN series central furnaces. Goodman states that since the 40-second delay is indicative
of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in an improvement in efficiency of 0.6 to 1.0 percent,
the petition should be granted. 
Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5-minute delay. Goodman indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of
these exceptions for its GMN series central furnaces. 
Since the blower controls incorporated on the Goodman furnaces are designed to impose a 40-second blower delay in
every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE
agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 40-second blower time delay when testing the Goodman GMN series
central furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GMN series central furnaces, today's Decision and Order
exempts Goodman from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 40-second delay.

It is, therefore, ordered that: 
(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Goodman Manufacturing Company (Case No. F&hyph;067) is hereby granted as
set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 
(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Goodman Manufacturing Company,
shall be permitted to test its GMN series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part
430, with modifications set forth below. 
(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:

3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to appendix N as follows:

3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t^), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 



0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.

(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Goodman Manufacturing Company shall comply in all
respects with the test procedures specified in appendix N of 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.


(3) The waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the GMN series central furnaces manufactured by Goodman Manufacturing Company.

(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect.

(5) Effective March 11, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Goodman Manufacturing Company
on February 10, 1994. 58 FR 8608, February 23, 1994 (Case No. F&hyph;066).

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Interim Management of Nuclear Materials at the Savannah
River Site </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). DOE proposes to evaluate
nuclear materials currently stored at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and determine what materials can safely remain
in their current form for an interim period (approximately 5 years) until disposition decisions can be made. DOE will
also determine what materials are at risk and therefore require near-term stabilization to assure continued safe
management. DOE will evaluate the nuclear materials using a proposed set of criteria to determine materials which
require near-term stabilization to help maintain the health and safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental
quality. DOE would then stabilize the materials determined to be of concern. 



DOE also proposes that some nuclear materials at the SRS should be converted, or should be considered for conversion,
to a useable form. Plutonium-242 is used for research and development programs and the SRS inventory of this material
is needed for this programmatic purpose. As a result, DOE proposes to convert the SRS inventory of plutonium-242 solution
to an oxide. 
Additionally, DOE is in the process of determining whether a programmatic need 
exists for americium-243, curium-244, and neptunium-237. If it is determined 
that a need for this material exists, the EIS will also evaluate its 
conversion to a useable form. Any conversion of this material would be for 
purposes other than the production of nuclear weapons. 

The nuclear materials to be evaluated will be those which have historically 
been either the feed materials for, or the in-process material of, SRS 
production and reprocessing programs.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The need for the EIS is driven by the evolving requirements associated with the defense programs of the United States
and the resultant requirement to manage the materials in the interim pending disposition decisions. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
This material does not include that associated with the plutonium-238 production mission in HB-Line. The purpose
of that mission is to support the National Aeronautics Space Administration deep space probe program. This effort
is the subject of separate NEPA documentation.

</FOOTNOTE>


DOE plans to address waste management activities at SRS in a separate EIS. 
The waste management EIS for SRS will be announced shortly, by a separate 
Notice of Intent. 




INVITATION TO COMMENT: 

To ensure the EIS addresses the full range of issues 
and alternatives related to this proposal, DOE invites comments on the 
proposed scope of the EIS from all interested parties. Please direct written 
comments to assist DOE in identifying significant environmental issues and 
defining the appropriate scope of the EIS to Mr. Stephen R. Wright at the 
address indicated below. DOE also invites agencies, organizations, and the 
general public to present oral comments pertinent to the preparation of this 
EIS at the public scoping meetings on the dates indicated below. In addition, 
DOE will accept comments electronically via voice mail or facsimile 
transmission by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;242&hyph;8269. DOE will give equal consideration to 
all comments. 



After the completion of the public scoping process, DOE will prepare an EIS 
Implementation Plan and make it available to the public upon request. The 
Implementation Plan will record the results of the scoping process and define 
the alternatives and issues that DOE will evaluate in the EIS. DOE intends to 
complete the Draft EIS in late 1994, and will announce its availability in the 


Federal Register

. DOE will solicit comments from the public, organizations, 
and other agencies on the Draft EIS, and will consider all comments in its 
preparation of the Final EIS. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The public scoping period will continue until May 31, 1994. DOE will 
consider all written comments postmarked by May 31, 1994, and will consider 
comments postmarked after that date to the extent practicable.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Savannah River Site is an 800 square-kilometer (300 square-mile), controlled area in southwestern South Carolina.
The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia and 20 miles south of 
Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the SRS has 
been to produce nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and 
medical programs of the United States. 



Historically, reactor fuel or target assemblies were chemically dissolved into aqueous solutions in the F- or H-Canyon
chemical separations facilities. 

Various processes were performed to separate the useful isotopes (uranium-235, uranium-238, neptunium-237, plutonium-238,
americium-243, curium-244, and 
plutonium-239) from the rest of the fuel and target material. The uranium-235 
solutions were shipped off the site for conversion to a solid form and the 
uranium-238 in solution was converted to an oxide using the FA-Line facility 
at SRS. The neptunium-237 was recovered, and when required, converted to a 
solid and fashioned into new targets. The plutonium was recovered and 
converted to metal or oxide products using the FB- and HB-Line facilities. 
Most converted materials were shipped to other DOE sites. Any product 
materials stored onsite were placed in ``vaults'' designed for storage. 

In March 1992, chemical processing operations were suspended in the canyons to 
address a potential safety concern. The concern was subsequently addressed, 
but prior to resumption of processing, the Secretary of Energy directed that 
defense-related chemical separations activities (i.e., reprocessing) be phased 
out at SRS. Since this decision, the Department has determined that further 
action related to the disposition of nuclear material is subject to the NEPA 
process. Non-safety related facility operations have remained shut down, with 
the exception of plutonium-238 processing associated with the support of NASA 
missions. 

As a result of these shutdowns, the canyons and the reactor fuel and target storage basins
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 have a large inventory of in-process solutions, fuel assemblies, and targets. This inventory includes materials
containing a wide variety of special isotopes (plutonium-239, uranium-235, plutonium-242, 
americium-243, curium-244, neptunium-237, etc.). There are approximately 
100,000 gallons of in-process solutions in storage and approximately 200 
metric tons of spent fuel and targets in storage. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
There are several storage basins currently in use. These are the K-, L-, and P-Reactor basins, the Receiving Basin
for Off-site Fuels (RBOF) located in H-Area, and the Canyon receiving basins.

</FOOTNOTE>


In addition to the above solutions and targets, there are over 90,000 gallons 
of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) stored in tanks outside the facility. The 
UNH contains the uranium-235 recovered from the processing of fuel from SRS 
production reactors, and DOE, domestic, and foreign research reactors. 

There are also approximately 35,000 55-gallon drums of uranium-238 (known as 
``depleted uranium'') oxide stored on the site. This material is the product of 
processing the targets from which plutonium-239 is recovered. 

For some solutions (e.g., enriched uranium and americium/curium) no conversion 
capability exists. Conversion, stabilization, or disposition options must be 
developed for such solutions.

DOE has established a Secretarial task force to evaluate disposition of surplus nuclear materials stored at various
locations within the weapons complex. Until disposition decisions are made (approximately 5 years), some of the
materials at SRS, due to their form or to the condition in which they are currently maintained, could represent an unreasonable
risk to public and worker health and safety or an unreasonable risk to the environment. For example, the aluminum cladding
on some of the targets is deteriorating due to corrosion. As the cladding corrodes, highly radioactive material is
exposed to the water in the storage basin. Some of this material is released into the water, which can result in increased
worker exposures and environmental releases. Another example of material that could present an unreasonable risk
is stored solutions containing plutonium, other transuranic elements, and uranium. These solutions require continuing
vigilance to assure their continued safe storage and to avoid potentially severe radiological impacts should an
accident occur. 

Additionally, DOE wants to reduce the cost of maintaining and storing these nuclear materials. The cost to maintain
just the SRS canyons, with their current inventory of material, is about $300 million a year. These costs could be reduced
through consolidation, conversion, and stabilization. 



Proposed Action 



The Department proposes to stabilize nuclear materials currently stored at the SRS that are in a condition that may
not be safe over the time that is necessary to make decisions regarding their long-term disposition (approximately
5 years). The EIS will evaluate and identify which nuclear materials should be stabilized because of a health, safety,
or environmental concern related to the condition of the material.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
If at any time during the course of preparing the environmental impact statement the Department were to determine
that an emergency condition such as unreasonable risk to public or worker health and safety or the environment exists
with respect to any of the unstable materials, the Department would take action to respond immediately to the situation
and consult with the Council on Environmental Quality regarding alternative arragements for compliance with NEPA.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Department also proposes to convert to a useable form those materials for which a programmatic need exists. These
materials are used in research and development programs. Specifically, DOE has identified a need for additional
plutonium-242, and proposes to convert the existing inventory of that material at SRS from a solution to an oxide.
In addition, if during the development of this EIS, a programmatic need is identified for neptunium-237, americium-243,
or curium-244, this material will also be proposed for conversion to a useable form. Any programmatic need for americium-243
and curium-244 could not be satisfied until conversion technology is developed. 



Alternatives Proposed for Consideration 



DOE will examine various methods to accomplish stabilization. Based on current information, the preferred alternative
for some of these materials, (e.g., in-process liquids) would be to operate the canyon facilities (including FB-Line
and HB-Line, Phases I and II) only as may be necessary for stabilization, and then to place the facilities in a standby
condition. For some materials, (e.g., americium and curium solutions) the Department currently has no preferred
alternative, and the EIS will assist the Department in identifying a preferred alternative. The Department solicits
public participation in identifying and evaluating alternatives. Alternatives could include dry storage, new
wet storage, and processing for vitrification without chemical separation. Alternatives to the conversion of material
required for programmatic needs have not been identified. Consistent with NEPA's requirement that the ``no action''
alternative be considered, DOE will evaluate the environmental impacts of continuing to manage all materials in
their current form until decisions regarding disposition are made. 



Material Inventory Evaluation Criteria 



DOE proposes to evaluate the inventory of nuclear materials at the SRS and place the material into one of three categories.
These categories are: (1) Materials that may warrant near-term stabilization in order to maintain the health and
safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental quality; (2) material for which there is still a programmatic
need; and (3) materials for which there is currently no designated programmatic need and which are already in a stable
form. DOE proposes to use the following criteria to categorize material that warrants near-term stabilization and
solicits public comments on how these criteria may be further refined:

<TEXT>
 


1. Materials which, without stabilization, would present a near-term (i.e., 
approximately 5 years) risk of increasing worker radiation exposure or 
exposure to hazardous materials by an amount that is not insignificant. 



2. Materials which, without stabilization, would present a near-term risk 
of a release of radioactive or hazardous material to the public or the 
environment that is not insignificant.



3. Materials for which stabilization or use of an alternative storage 
method will, in the near-term, reduce the degree of hazard presented by 
the material in its current form by an amount that is not insignificant. 



4. Material for which stabilization in the near-term would reduce the 
generation of radioactive waste by an amount that is not insignificant. 

DOE intends that decisions regarding which materials merit near-term 
stabilization will be based exclusively on the risk they pose to the safety 
and health of workers or the public, or to the environment. Although DOE 
expects to realize some maintenance related cost savings by stabilizing 
at-risk materials, DOE does not intend to consider economics as a criterion in 
the categorization process. That is, DOE does not propose to process 
materials that DOE determines, after public input, will remain stable until 
decisions regarding disposition can be made, even if it were judged to be cost 
effective to process them in conjunction with materials to be stabilized. 



DOE solicits public comments on the criteria and approach described above. 




Identification of Environmental and Other Issues 





DOE has identified the 
following issues for analysis for proposed and alternative actions in the EIS. 




Environmental Issues 





1. Public and Worker Safety, Health Risk Assessment_Radiological and 
nonradiological impacts, including projected effects on workers and the public 
from normal operations and potential accidents. 



2. Waste Management_The impact on the generation, treatment, storage, 
and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, low-level radioactive waste, 
transuranic (TRU) waste, hazardous waste, and mixed waste on new and existing 
onsite waste management and storage facilities. The EIS will describe the 
types and quantities of waste that would be generated by implementation. It 
will not consider specific waste disposal alternatives (e.g., a comparison of 
the impacts caused by the treatment and interim storage of vitrified 
reprocessing waste with those caused by the treatment and interim storage of 
unprocessed forms). These will be evaluated in the SRS waste management EIS. 



3. Regulatory Compliance_A determination of the status of compliance 
with all applicable Federal, state, and local statutes and regulations; 
required Federal and state environmental consultations and notifications; and 

DOE Orders on waste management, including waste minimization initiatives, and environmental protection. 



4. Air Quality_Potential effects on air quality from radiological and 
nonradiological emissions. 



5. Water Resources_Effects on the quality and the quantity of ground- 
and surface-water resources, including wetlands, and on downstream water 
users. 



6. Onsite Transportation_Impacts on the onsite workers and 
transportation systems resulting from transportation of raw materials, 
supplies, equipment, products, and wastes for both routine transportation and 
accident scenarios. 



7. Socioeconomic_Socioeconomic impacts in the SRS area. 




Related NEPA Reviews





The following is a list of existing or forthcoming NEPA documentation related 
to materials or activities at SRS. 




Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS





DOE will shortly announce its 
intent to prepare an EIS on waste management activities at the SRS. The 
purpose of the EIS is to provide a basis for DOE to select a sitewide 
strategic approach to managing present and future SRS waste generated as a 
result of ongoing operations, environmental restoration activities, 
transition, and decontamination and decommissioning activities. The EIS will 
address, at a minimum, the generation, minimization, treatment, storage, and 
disposal of low-level waste, liquid high-level waste, nonradioactive hazardous 
waste, mixed waste, and transuranic waste.

PEIS for Waste Management 





DOE has published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to 
prepare a Programmatic EIS on Environmental Restoration and Waste Management 
(EM PEIS) (55 FR 42633, October 22, 1990). An Implementation Plan for this 
PEIS was published in February 1994. A draft PEIS is currently expected to be 
issued by September 1994. 




EIS for Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National 
Engineering Laboratory (INEL) Environmental Restoration and Waste Management





This EIS is currently in preparation and will include, among other issues, a 
programmatic analysis for the transportation, receipt, processing and storage 
of spent nuclear fuel, including consideration of sites other than INEL. SRS 
is one of the alternative sites being evaluated. 





Environmental Assessment (EA) for HB-Line Operation 





HB-Line is currently operating to provide plutonium-238 for future space missions. In July 1991, DOE issued an Environmental
Assessment for Radioisotope Heat Source Fuel Processing and Fabrication, DOE/EA&hyph;0534. Based on the analysis
in the EA, DOE 
determined that the proposed action, which included operation of HB-Line 
Phases I and III, does not significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on July 
21, 1991; the FONSI was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 25, 1991 (56 
FR 34057). As part of a negotiated court settlement, DOE is preparing an 
additional EA that will examine impacts of operating HB-Line Phases I and III 
beyond those activities currently underway. The cumulative impacts of 
operation of HB-Line Phases I and III in conjunction with the proposed action 
and alternatives will be addressed in this nuclear materials interim 
management EIS. 




EA and EIS for Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel 





DOE is preparing an EIS 
on the proposed adoption and implementation of a policy for the acceptance of 
up to 15,000 spent nuclear fuel elements from foreign research reactors. This 
EIS is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 1995. In the interim, to 
meet the needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid 
failure of a key United States nuclear nonproliferation objective, DOE 
proposes to accept a small number of foreign research reactor spent fuel 
elements for storage at an existing SRS wet storage facility. DOE has 
prepared and has issued for public comment, a draft EA (February 1994) to 
evaluate the environmental impact of this proposed interim action. 




Canyon Ventilation Upgrade EIS 





On March 20, 1992, DOE published an NOI to 
prepare an EIS for the upgrade of canyon exhaust systems at SRS (57 FR 9693). 
An Implementation Plan was issued in January 1993. The scope of the upgrade 
is being substantially reduced and DOE is presently evaluating what level of 
analysis is required under NEPA, as a result of the change in scope. 




EA for Plutonium Storage in Building 247&hyph;F Vault 





DOE is preparing an 
environmental assessment to evaluate the impacts of consolidating certain 
stable plutonium materials for interim storage into an existing vault located 
in Building 247&hyph;F at the SRS. The EA will evaluate the consolidated storage 
of plutonium materials currently stored at several locations on the SRS. 




EISs for Reactor Operation 





DOE has published two Final EISs on nuclear 
reactor operation at SRS: 
L-Reactor Operation, DOE/EIS&hyph;0108, 1984, and 
Continued Operation of K-,


L-, and P-Reactors (ROEIS), DOE/EIS&hyph;0147, 1990. 
DOE stated in the Final ROEIS that it will prepare an EIS ``that includes more 
detail on the environmental impacts of support facilities.'' The EIS addressed 
by this NOI partially fulfills that commitment. 




Reconfiguration PEIS 





On July 23, 1993, DOE published a revised Notice of 
Intent to prepare a PEIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex 
(56 FR 39528) due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department is 
reviewing the reconfiguration alternatives based on scoping comments resulting 
from public review of the revised Notice of Intent and budget projections. 
The results of this review will be presented in a revised Implementation Plan 
that will replace the earlier (February 1992) Implementation Plan. The SRS 
will be analyzed as a candidate site.

of surplus energy and surplus energy sales contracts for the Snettisham Project. The Marketing Plan is fully compatible
with the Department of Energy's legislative proposal for APA divestiture which is currently undergoing Congressional
consideration.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Applications for an allocation of surplus energy must be received in APA's Headquarters Office by the close of business
on May 6, 1994. See section II for further details.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Draft Surplus Marketing Plan_Snettisham Project


I. Background 


APA published the Draft Surplus Power Marketing Plan in the 

Federal Register

 on January 7, 1994 (FR 59 1013). A public information and comment forum was held January 18, 1994. Written comments
were accepted until February 7, 1994. Two written comments were received. A discussion of the comments is presented
in section III. 
APA has considered the comments received and is publishing herein the Final Surplus Power Marketing Plan. This 

Federal Register

 notice also formally invites requests for allocation of surplus energy in accordance with the plan. Based on the provisions
of the Plan, APA will then allocate surplus energy and sign contracts with customers receiving allocations. 
An Environmental Assessment was prepared for these power marketing activities and a Finding of No Significant Impact
was issued by the Department of Energy. 


II. Application Procedures 


APA formally invites requests for allocations of surplus energy from the Snettisham Project from qualified applicants.
Applicants should advise APA's Administrator in writing of their requests. Written requests must be received at
the APA Headquarters Office at 2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 

#

2B, Juneau, AK 99801, by the close of business on May 6, 1994. Applicants must identify the amount of energy desired.



III. Discussion of Public Comments and Summary of Revisions 


APA received two written comments on the Draft Surplus Power Marketing Plan. The points raised in the comments are
discussed below. 
1. 

Comment: 

As originally proposed, a ``major industrial load'' would have been one which was not currently a firm customer of
AEL&amp;P, does not conduct utility type operations, and which has the capability to meet its own energy requirement
in the absence of Snettisham energy. 
Both commentators objected to the definition excluding a potential major industrial load, such as a mine, simply
because it is presently a firm customer of AEL&amp;P for a small amount of firm energy used at an office facility. They
proposed that the definition be changed so as not to preclude such loads. 
One commentator suggested that the definition be strengthened as to the requirement for being able to meet its own
energy requirement. They pointed out that a qualified load should be able to meet its own baseload energy requirement
rather than its peak requirements or its requirement during intermittent curtailment of Snettisham energy. 


Discussion: 

APA believes these suggestions clarify the intent of the marketing plan. As revised, a major industrial load is one
which does not conduct utility-type operations and whose major load is not currently served as a firm load by AEL&amp;P.
The major industrial load must also have the capability to meet its own baseload energy requirement in the long-term
absence of Snettisham energy. 
2. 

Comment: 

One commentator felt that there was apparently a conflict between the provision in section C that ``entities receiving
an allocation of Snettisham resources will be offered an electric service contract&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''
and the provision in section B.3. that ``allocations will be made to AEL&amp;P.'' They asked for clarification as
to whether a major industrial load would enter into a contract with APA, with AEL&amp;P, or with both. 


Discussion: 

Potential surplus energy customers are encouraged to work directly with AEL&amp;P. In this case, AEL&amp;P will
make the request, the allocation will be to AEL&amp;P, and the contract will be between APA and AEL&amp;P. The major
industrial customer and AEL&amp;P will presumably have their own contractual arrangements. As indicated in the
plan, if service through AEL&amp;P is demonstrated to be infeasible, then APA will consider an allocation and contract
directly with the major industrial customer. 
3. 

Comment: 

The contracts for surplus energy should not only include assurance that the allocation will continue after divestiture
with APA, but that the rates charged for energy will continue also. 


Discussion: 

The contracts will contain language to assure that the allocation continues, but will not contain language which
binds the new owner to a given rate structure. The existing purchase agreement for Snettisham was negotiated to assure
only that allocations would continue, but that the new owner would set their own rates. The contracts will not ``guarantee''
rates for APA, but will allow APA to adjust rates within its own procedures and guidelines. This has been clarified
in the final plan. 
4. 

Comment: 

The allocation reservation fee should be refundable to the extent that allocated energy is not made available for
taking during the year. 


Discussion: 

This has been clarified in the final plan. 
5. 

Comment: 

APA should not allocate energy among competing applicants by dividing it equally, but should be made some other way,
such as proportionate to the size of the requests, or by benefit to the local economy, etc. 


Discussion: 

There are any number of ways to allocate a limited resource. APA expects that if there are competing requests for allocation,
they will all be in excess of the resource available and they will all be based on estimates of future loads rather than
historic use. For this reason APA will divide the resource equally as explained in the plan.

IV. Final Surplus Power Marketing Plan 


A. Conditions for Allocation 


Allocations of surplus energy will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Marketing Plan. These provisions
include: 
1. No energy will be allocated for export outside the Juneau market area (that is, the AEL&amp;P service territory)
without firm plans and commitment to finance and build the necessary transmission facilities. 
2. In allocating surplus energy, APA will give preference to public bodies and cooperatives who conduct utility-type
operations. 
3. Surplus energy not allocated to preference customers may be available to serve major industrial loads. For this
marketing plan, a major industrial load is one which does not conduct utility-type operations and whose major load
is not currently served as a firm load by AEL&amp;P. The major industrial load must also have the capability to meet
its own baseload energy requirement in the long-term absence of Snettisham energy. Major industrial loads are encouraged
to work directly with AEL&amp;P so that AEL&amp;P can request an allocation to serve their needs. In this case, allocations
will be made to AEL&amp;P. APA will consider requests for direct service of major industrial loads only if it is demonstrated
that service through the utility is infeasible. 


B. Contract Provisions 


Entities receiving an allocation of Snettisham resources will be offered an electric service contract which will
include the following provisions: 
1. Contracts will be for a period of 20 years or less beginning at contract execution. Contracts for less than 20 years
may include an option to extend the period up to a total length of 20 years. Contracts will be compatible with the proposed
APA divestiture. Contracts will contain language guaranteeing the continuation of the allocation after divestiture.

2. Surplus energy will be marketed at the Snettisham firm rate. The rate is presently 3.21 cents/kwh and is subject
to periodic review and adjustment. 
3. The contractor will be required to sign a contract within 270 days of APA's letter granting an allocation. 

4. In order to reserve the allocation, the contractor will be required to deposit 10% of the expected cost of the following
year's energy with APA. If the allocated energy is taken during the year, the deposit will be credited toward the cost
of the energy. To the extent that energy is available for delivery, if the allocation is not completely taken the deposit
is non-refundable. In any year, energy reserved in this way but not taken by the contractor may be marketed by APA. In
any case, an applicant must be ready, willing, and able to take initial delivery of power by January 1, 1997 or the allocation
will be withdrawn and the energy reallocated. 
5. If the contractor has not committed to a 20-year contract, the contractor will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable
payment within 30 days after contract execution. This payment will be based on 3% of the average estimated annual energy
delivery during the years between the end of the contract period and the 20-year period times each year less than 20
years. 


C. Amount Available for Allocation 


Firm energy output (energy available 9 years out of 10) from the Snettisham Project is estimated at 275 gwh/year. Secondary
energy is estimated to vary from 0 to 100 gwh/year and average around 50 gwh/year. This invitation is for requests for
allocation for energy that is surplus to the needs of the Juneau community. An estimate of that need is shown in the table
below. Applicants must be aware that these are only estimates and that the amount of energy required by the community
may vary from these projections. In the event that there are competing requests from qualified applicants, the surplus
energy will be divided equally among the applicants up to their maximum request.

<DOCTITLE>Gaviota Terminal Co.; Complaint</DOCTITLE>


March 11, 1994.


Take notice that on February 28, 1994, The Producer Group filed a complaint with the Commission concerning the February
4, 1994 tariff filing made by Gaviota Terminal Co. (Gaviota), with a proposed effective date of February 14, 1994.
The Producer Group complains that the failure of Gaviota to file a tariff prior to February 4, 1994 was in violation
of the Interstate Commerce Act for which appropriate sanctions should be provided.
The Producer Group states that Gaviota has been operating since June 1991, and had not submitted a tariff to the Commission
until it made its February 4, 1994 filing, notwithstanding that it is an interstate oil transportation company subject
to the terms of the Interstate Commerce Act. The Producer Group states that oil pipelines, such as Gaviota, are obligated
to file their jurisdictional rates for the Commission's examination, and that Gaviota, for almost three years, provided
oil transportation service without a tariff being on file.
The Producer Group requests the Commission to establish a reasonable rate for the period during which Gaviota operated
without a tariff and to order refunds for any past payments in excess of that rate.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests
should be filed on or before April 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 11, 1994.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. RP92&hyph;137&hyph;023]</RINDOCK>



<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>


March 11, 1994.


Take notice that on March 8, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) submitted for filing certain
revised tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, which tariff sheets are enumerated in Appendix
A to the filing. The tariff sheets are proposed to be effective as set forth in Appendix A to the filing.
TGPL states that on May 3, 1993 it submitted a Settlement in the referenced proceeding which, among other things, resolved
cost-of-service, cost allocation, rate design and throughput mix for the period September 1, 1992 (the effective
date of Docket No. RP92&hyph;137) through October 31, 1993 (the date immediately preceding the November 1, 1993 effective
date of TGPL's Order No. 636 restructuring). On November 4, 1993 the Commission issued an order approving the Settlement
(November 4 Order).
TGPL states that the tariff sheets submitted in the instant filing reflect the settlement rates approved by the November
4 Order updated to incorporate tracker filings made subsequent to the date the Settlement was filed (i.e. subsequent
to May 3, 1993). The purpose of those filings was to track, under certain TGPL rate schedules, rate changes made effective
by upstream providers of storage and transportation services. TGPL states that Appendix B to the filing includes
workpapers which support the derivation of TGPL's settlement rates for those services affected by the aforementioned
tracker filings. Also, TGPL has revised its historical imbalance tariff provisions (section 5.8 of Rate Schedules
FT and IT) consistent with the directives set forth in the November 4 Order.
TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested
parties.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before March 18, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior to the registration or reregistration of a pesticide, the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), must determine
whether the chemical will cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment under FIFRA. In the process
of making the determination, OPP reviews all data submitted by the registrant to support the effectiveness and safety
of the chemical, published reports or studies from the open literature unpublished reports or studies which bear
on the issues at hand, and the chemical's general and environmental chemistry relationship to possible human and
domestic animal exposure. In some instances, OPP requests the registrant to conduct additional studies, or directly
funds research to complete the registration. 


OPP, under IAG DW89936171&hyph;01, is contracting with ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. for specialized technical
assistance in the identification of information shortfalls dealing with the registration of pesticides. This research
effort will concentrate on systematically identifying, analyzing, and evaluating data associated with pesticide
registrations. The intent is to catalog data gaps from the registrant to fully characterize the safe manufacture,
application, re-entry, and residue issues prior to a decision to issue a registration under FIFRA.

OPP has determined that the IAG herein described involves work that is being conducted in connection with FIFRA, in
that pesticide chemicals will be the subject of certain evaluations to be made under this IAG. These evaluations may
be used in subsequent regulatory decisions under FIFRA.

Some of this information may be entitled to confidential treatment. The information has been submitted to EPA under
sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of FIFRA and under sections 408 and 409 of FFDCA.

In accordance with the requirement of 40 CFR 2.209(c), 2.307(h), and 2.308(h)(2), this IAG with ORNL and Martin Marietta
Inc. prohibits use of the information for any purpose other than the purposes specified in this IAG; prohibits disclosure
of the information in any form to a third party without prior written approval from the Agency; and requires that each
official and employee sign an agreement to protect the information from unauthorized release and to handle it in accordance
with the FIFRA Information Security Manual. In addition ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. are required to submit for EPA
approval a security plan under which any CBI will be secured and protected against unauthorized release or compromise.
No information will be provided until the above requirements have been fully satisfied. Records of information provided
under this IAG will be maintained by the Project Officer for this contract in OPP.

All information supplied to ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. by EPA for use in connection with this IAG will be returned
to EPA when ORNL and Martin Marietta Inc. have completed their work.

and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed above is substantially
complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these
active ingredients are eligible for reregistration.







List A -



Case 0024 &blank;&blank; Boric Acid, Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax Decahydrate), Sodium Tetraborate
Pentahydrate (Borax Pentahydrate), Sodium Tetraborate (Anhydrous Borax), Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate,
Disodium Octaborate (Anhydrous), and Sodium Metaborate 

Case 0071 &blank;&blank; Butylate;
Case 0032 &blank;&blank; Daminozide;
Case 0178 &blank;&blank; Glyphosate
Case 0172 &blank;&blank; Sulfuryl Fluoride;

To request a copy of any of the listed RED documents, or a RED Fact Sheet, contact the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response
and Program Resources Branch, in Rm 1132 at the address given above or call (703) 305&hyph;5805.

All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate
RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product specific data requirements (if applicable)
within 8 months of receipt, with the exception of eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate. Products containing the
other active ingredients will not be reregistered until adequate product specific data have been submitted and all
necessary product label changes are implemented.
For products containing eugenol and phenyl-ethyl-propionate, the Agency is considering these products for exemption
from registration under Section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide and Rodenticide Act. Therefore, no product specific
labeling or data are being required at this time.
The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both
the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as
final documents with a 60&hyph;day comment period. Although the 60&hyph;day public comment period does not affect
the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating
any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly
affect a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the 

Federal Register

III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 



Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before June 15, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1&hyph;year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. 

Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which
have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless
the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed,
sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved
label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when
more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been
imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated
with a particular chemical.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 By mail: Kathleen Depukat, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: Accelerated Reregistration Branch,
3rd floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8587. 




</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice is issued pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
7 U.S.C. section 136 et seq. It announces the Agency's decision on a request for cancellation of the registrations
of 

PIROR P-15

 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36) and 

PIROR P-05

 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42). 



I. Request for Voluntary Cancellation 



In a letter dated October 15, 1993, Union Carbide requested voluntary cancellation of 

PIROR P-15

 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and 

PIROR P-05

 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42) waived any comment period associated
with the request, and waived any requirement for 

Federal Register

 publication of a notice announcing Agency receipt of this request in advance of Agency acceptance of this request.




II. Existing Stocks Determination 



Union Carbide's October 15, 1993, request for voluntary cancellation expressly stated that, if EPA accepted the
request, there would be no sale or distribution of the 

PIROR

 products after November 1, 1993, except for export in accordance with the provisions of FIFRA which address export
of unregistered products. Therefore, after November 1, 1993, Union Carbide, its distributors and supplemental
registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products after November 1, 1993. Other persons (people other than
Union Carbide, its distributors, or its supplemental registrants) holding stocks of the affected products may sell,
distribute, and use their stocks until exhausted.

For the purposes of this order, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of the affected products which are in the
U.S. and were not in the custody or control of Union Carbide, its distributors or supplemental registrants after November
1, 1993, the requested effective date of the cancellation. 



III. EPA's Decision on the Request for Voluntary Cancellation and Cancellation Order 



On November 1, 1993, EPA granted Union Carbide's request that the registration(s) of the following products containing
Paraclox be voluntarily cancelled: 

PIROR P-15

 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and PIROR P05 Paper Slimicide and
Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42). Concurrently, EPA is issuing a Cancellation Order for
these products. This notice contains the terms and conditions of the Cancellation Order for these products. 

Under section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, a registrant may request at any time that EPA cancel any of its pesticide registrations.
EPA must publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of receipt of the request allowing public comment before granting the request unless either the registrant
requests a waiver of the notice or the Administrator determines that the continued use of the pesticide would pose
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Union Carbide expressly requested that the cancellation of its
products be effective as of November 1, 1993. Union Carbide also waived any comment period and the requirement for
publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the Agency's receipt of the request for voluntary cancellation prior to the Agency's acceptance of Union
Carbide's request. 

Accordingly, this Cancellation Order became effective on November 1, 1993. Therefore, as of November 1, 1993, no
person may distribute, sell, or use these product, except as described below. Union Carbide, its distributors and
supplemental registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products except in accordance with provisions concerning
export of unregistered pesticide products. Any other person holding stocks of the affected products may sell, distribute
and use such stocks until exhausted. Any sale, distribution or other disposition of existing stocks that is not consistent
with the terms of this Order will be considered a violation of FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(K) and/or section 12(a)(1)(A),
as appropriate.

The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Innovative Technology Council, comprised of EPA management and staff
from across the Agency, has drafted a strategy to focus and target its efforts to accelerate environmental technology
development, commercialization and use. The Council recognizes a need to accelerate the development, commercialization,
and use of innovative environmental technologies to maintain and improve environmental quality at home and abroad
into the 21st century. Environmental quality would deteriorate, given foreseeable population growth and industrialization,
unless technology is developed and more broadly applied, that is more effective in preventing and reducing pollution
levels, less costly than existing technology and supportive of sustainable development. EPA, state and local agencies
are in a unique position to influence the rate and focus of environmental technology innovation and use because of
their legislative and programmatic mandates and regulatory responsibilities (which often influence the demand
for environmental technologies, goods and services).

EPA's draft 

Strategy

 provides a plan to directly and indirectly support private sector innovation and diffusion activities sponsored
by the public and private sector and close coordination among Federal agencies. It focuses on creating incentives
for the development and use of innovative technologies in federal and state environmental regulations, reducing
barriers to technology innovation and use, and improving the competitiveness of the environmental technology industry
in domestic and international markets. EPA and other Federal, state and local agencies, universities, trade associations
and consortia, and numerous private companies are already working in many of the areas identified in the 

Strategy

. EPA is seeking public comment on the 

Strategy

 to focus and target efforts to accelerate environmental technology development, commercialization and use. The
Agency's Innovative Technology Council plans to revise and update the 

Strategy

 based on the comments received. 

The definition of ``environmental technologies'' being addressed in the 

Strategy

 varies widely for a number of reasons. The ``environmental technology industry'' has only recently become a focal
point for market analysts and policy-makers, and it is highly diversified in terms of the current demand for and supply
of technologies, goods and services. Demand often varies based on local environmental conditions. ``Environmental
technologies'' include technologies, goods, and services whose development is triggered primarily by environmental
improvement objectives. Sometimes referred to as ``dark green'' technologies, these include: products and services
to monitor and assess pollutant releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which prevent pollution,
control air and water pollution levels, safely manage waste and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and,
manage environmental data. EPA's 

Strategy

 also addresses ``light green'' technologies that are developed primarily for non-environmental reasons; those
technologies can have indirect, but important consequences for improving environmental quality. An example, would
be local area computer networks designed to enhance office communication, but which also reduce paper use. 

EPA is interested in promoting all phases of technological change such as: the research and development of new concepts;
preliminary design testing and pilot applications of evolving technologies; performance demonstrations and testing;
evaluations of early commercial applications; and diffusion into domestic and international markets. 

The draft ``

Technology Innovation Strategy

'' outlines the general principles that guide EPA in its efforts to foster innovation in its existing programs and
new projects being initiated under the President's Environmental Technology Initiative in FY1994 and FY1995 to
foster the development and use of environmental technologies in solving the nation's environmental problems. It
outlines four objectives: 

1. Adapt EPA's policy, regulatory, and compliance framework to promote innovation; 
2. Strengthen the capacity of technology developers and users to succeed in environmental technology innovation;

3. Strategically invest EPA funds in the development and commercialization of promising new technologies; and
4. Accelerate diffusion of innovative technologies at home and abroad. 

EPA invites comments on the draft 

Strategy

 and the following questions:

(1) What roles are appropriate for EPA to play in stimulating the development and use of innovative technological
solutions to environmental problems? 

(2) Do you agree with the 

Strategy's

 objectives and with EPA's approaches to achieving them? Which objectives should receive the highest priority for
action? 

(3) Are there additional areas of emphasis that EPA should address in planning and funding its technology development,
commercialization, and diffusion activities? 

(4) Are there particular environmental technology needs or impediments to development on which you feel the Agency
should focus more of its attention? 

(5) How can EPA measure the success of its efforts? 

(6) Which environmental problems need better, faster, cheaper technological solutions? 

(7) Do you have any suggestions for ways for EPA to develop, collect and/or disseminate information on the performance
of environmental technologies? 

(8) Can you identify specific federal or state environmental regulations, permitting programs or enforcement activities
where technology innovation is being impeded? 

(9) Are there specific industries or businesses whose environmental problems are not being addressed in the 

Strategy

? 

Answers to these questions and comments received on the 

Strategy

 will be considered in EPA's planning and budgeting for technology development and promotion projects in FY 1995 and
future years.

ACTION: 

Policy statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Policy Statement establishes non-binding guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Federal
Communications Commission's (FCC's) broadcast Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rule. The EEO rule prohibits
discrimination and requires affirmative action by broadcast stations in hiring. The new guidelines provide greater
guidance to stations and the public about what sanction may result from different types of EEO violations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Adopted: January 31, 1994; Released: February 1, 1994.

By the Commission: Commissioner Quello issuing a statement.



I. Introduction



1. In this Policy Statement, we establish non-binding guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the
Commission's broadcast Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) rules.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See 47 C.F.R. 73.2080.

</FOOTNOTE>


2. The Commission's broadcast EEO rules and other policies which promote participation by minorities and women in
the broadcast industry are vitally important. They further the Commission's goals of promoting diversity of programming
on broadcast stations. See 

NAACP

 v. 

FPC,

 425 U.S. 662, 670 n. 7 (1975); 

Metro Broadcasting, Inc.

 v. 

FCC,

 497 U.S. 547 (1990) (

Metro

). And, as the Supreme Court has noted, ``[s]afeguarding the public's right to receive a diversity of views and information
over the airwaves is *&blank;*&blank;* an integral component of the FCC's mission.'' 

Metro,

 497 U.S. at 548. We reaffirm our commitment to this bedrock goal underlying our broadcast EEO rules and believe that
the Policy Statement we adopt here will further achievement of that goal.

3. In addition to promoting program diversity, our broadcast EEO rules enhance access by minorities and women to increased
employment opportunities. Increased employment opportunities are the foundation for increasing opportunities
for minorities and women in all facets of the communications industry, including participation in ownership.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Those who have access to employment opportunities are able to develop experience and expertise that can be put to beneficial
use in a variety of communications enterprises, in a variety of ways. Thus, by combating discrimination and other
arbitrary barriers to employment, we contribute to the development of the broadcast industry and ultimately promote
the further development of the broader communications infrastructure.

We note, in this regard, that Section 309(j)(4)(C) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, directs the Commission
to promote economic opportunity in competitive bidding among applicants proposing to use the spectrum ``by disseminating
licenses among a wide variety of applicants *&blank;*&blank;* including businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women.''

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Background



4. In 1989, Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 to increase substantially the maximum dollar amounts
of forfeitures the Commission could impose on broadcasters under Section 503(b) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission's forfeiture rule has been amended to reflect the higher forfeiture amounts. 47 CFR 1.80(b)(1).



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Pub. L. No. 239, 101st Cong., lst Sess. 103 Stat. 2131 (1989) (amending, among other sections, 47 U.S.C. 503(b)). Amended
Section 503(b) provides the Commission with authority to assess forfeitures of up to $25,000 for each violation or
each day of a continuing violation against broadcasters, with a limit on forfeitures for continuing violations involving
a single act or failure to act of $250,000 for broadcasters.

</FOOTNOTE>


5. On August 1, 1991, in order to assist both the Commission and licensees in adjusting to the statutory increases,
the Commission released its Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures (1991 Policy Statement).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The 1991 Policy Statement provided general, non-binding guidance regarding the assessment of forfeitures. It established
base forfeiture amounts for a wide range of violations. For violations of broadcast EEO rules, the Commission set
a base amount of $12,500. The 1991 Policy Statement also provided that the base forfeiture amount for any violation
could be increased or decreased by applying adjustments to the base amount as relevant to the facts in any particular
case. On August 12, 1993, the Commission released its most recent forfeiture guidelines.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Among other actions, the 1993 Policy Statement deleted the broadcast EEO violation category and indicated that the
Commission would issue a further policy statement on broadcast EEO forfeiture matters at a later date.

III. Discussion


6. The Policy Statement we adopt here, as set forth in the Appendix, re-establishes the base forfeiture amount for
violations of the broadcast EEO rules at $12,500. It also provides guidance on what situations may generally lead
to such a forfeiture. In addition, it describes upward and downward adjustment criteria that may be used to adjust
the forfeiture in particular cases. The adjustment guidelines reflect the factors set forth in Section 503(b) of
the Act, &sect;1.80 of our rules and case precedent. See 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(2)(D); 47 CFR 1.80(b)(4). All of these factors
will not necessarily be relevant in each individual case and other adjustments may also be made as appropriate in particular
cases. The Appendix also provides guidance regarding when short-term renewals may be appropriate in particular
cases. We believe that these guidelines will assist the Commission and its staff in determining broadcast EEO forfeitures
in a generally consistent manner that furthers the public interest while nevertheless ensuring that the Commission
and the staff retain the discretion to decide each case based on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. At the
same time, we believe these guidelines will give licensees and the public greater guidance regarding which types
of forfeitures may result from particular types of EEO violations.
7. Finally, we stress that we do not intend this Policy Statement to limit our flexibility. In particular cases, forfeitures
that are higher or lower than those reflected by the guidelines may be imposed. In this regard, what we have said in connection
with our prior forfeiture policy statements applies here as well:



[T]he Policy Statement simply describes the general approach the Commission may take in forfeiture cases and is not
binding on any licensees or the Commission. The Policy Statement does not impose any obligations on [licensees] or
require the Commission to issue a forfeiture of any particular magnitude_or any forfeiture at all *&blank;*&blank;*.


* * * * *


[W]e reiterate that while the Policy Statement may guide us and the staff in particular cases, we do not intend for the
Commission or the staff to be bound by it. In addition, both the Commission and the staff intend to apply these guidelines
flexibly. In particular, we and the staff remain committed to deciding every forfeiture case on the basis of the specific
facts and equities presented in the record of that case.
7 FCC Rcd at 5339 (internal citations omitted).


IV. Conclusion


8. Accordingly, 

it is ordered that

 this Policy Statement is adopted, to the effective upon adoption.
9. The notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to this Policy
Statement. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), (d)(2).

Failure to recruit so as to attract an adequate pool of minority/female applicants or hires for at least 66% of all vacancies
during the license term being reviewed (Evidence of this violation will include (1) inadequate record-keeping and/or
(2) inadequate self-assessment throughout the license term)

I. Egregious Misconduct


A. Failure to recruit so as to attract an adequate pool of minority/female applicants or hires for at least 33% of all
vacancies reported for the license term being reviewed. Efforts are evaluated both for the station's staff overall
and for upper four job categories 
$6,250 upward adjustment.


(EEO programs achieving only this level of compliance will warrant a short-term renewal, irrespective of whether
other upward adjustments for ``egregiousness'' factors are present, if the percentage of vacancies for which the
licensee failed to recruit, or the percentage of pools containing minorities, falls below 33% and other factors_e.g.,
use and productivity of recruiting sources, use and productivity of minority-specific sources; evidence of self-assessment_are
absent or particularly inadequate)
B. Large number of hiring opportunities that did not translate into an adequate pool of minority/female applicants
or employees hired.



l_``Large number'' means hiring opportunities equal to at least the average number of employees on the full-time
staff, with a minimum of 25 hiring opportunities 
$6,250 upward adjustment (Base plus 50%)
_``Substantial number'' means hiring opportunities equal to three times the number of full-time staff, with a minimum
of 25 hiring opportunities 
Additional upward adjustment of 50-90% of base.


C. Large pool of minorities/women in the relevant labor force did not translate into an adequate pool of applicants
minority/women or employees hired
Analysis will focus on (1) the overall percentage of minorities in the relevant labor force and (2) the presence of
a single minority group constituting a significant percentage of that labor force.


_If a licensee has a relevant labor pool of at least 20 percent minorities or a single minority group constitutes at
least 10 percent of the labor force 
$6,250 to $11,250 upward adjustment (base plus 50-90%)

Short term renewals: 

Short term renewals will be assessed if (A), (B) or (C) are applied in any combination of two or more upward adjustments.
In addition, short term renewals also will be warranted where the specific criteria set forth in (A) above are present.
The presence of the mitigating factors described in Section II below are grounds for not issuing short term renewals.

II. Actual Hiring Experience



lA. Minority hiring represents 50% of the minority profile of the relevant labor force 

for both overall employment and upper four employment 

or 
$6,250 downward adjustment.
B. Minority hiring represents 100% of the minority profile of the relevant labor force 

for both overall employment and upper four employment

 
$6,250 downward adjustment and presumptive removal of short-term renewal. Evidence indicating the substantial
absence of an EEO program will rebut the presumption of removal.


III. Employment Profile

$6,250 downward adjustment and presumptive non-issuance of short-term renewal. Evidence indicating the complete
absence of an EEO program will rebut the presumption of removal.


III(C) and III(D) apply if the employment profile meets the guidelines in 4 of 5 years for a television renewal and 6
of 7 years for a radio renewal. Where less than a full term exists, the employment profile must meet the guidelines for
a majority of the years reported


IV. Employment Profile

Separate Statement of Commissioner James H. Quello


In the Matter of Standards for Assessing Forfeitures for Violations of the Broadcast EEO Rules


The Commission today has voted an item that will prove to be a turning point in the enforcement of our EEO rules. This


Policy Statement

 sets forth guidelines for assessing forfeitures for violations of the Commission's EEO rules. 47 CFR 73.2080. As
reflected in the statement, the base amount for a forfeiture will be $12,500, an amount that can be increased or decreased
depending on the facts of a given case. These higher forfeitures are a direct result of the increases in forfeiture
amounts imposed by Congress. The guidelines are designed to ensure that these new, higher forfeitures are assessed
in a reasoned, consistent manner. For this reason, and because I strongly support vigorous enforcement of our EEO
rules, I have voted in favor of this item.
However, at the same time, I am concerned that the Commission may be entering the era of the telecommunications superhighway
wielding a club, rather than offering a hand, to broadcasters making their way down the road. At the dawn of this new
era, we are imposing fines against 22 of 24 radio stations whose EEO records were reviewed, in amounts ranging from
$18,750 to $37,500. Short term renewals are assessed against 21 of the 22 stations receiving forfeitures. Radio broadcasters
will be ``contributing'' a total of $325,000 to the Federal Treasury as a result of our actions today. I am troubled
by the amount of these forfeitures and the increased use of the short term renewal as a sanction. Yet, I recognize that,
at least with respect to the increased forfeiture amounts, Congress increased our forfeiture authority.
I would have much preferred an approach that would have served three compelling goals: (1) Ensuring compliance with
our EEO rules by imposing meaningful sanctions; (2) imposing these sanctions in such a way so as not to cripple broadcasters
in their travels along the information superhighway; and (3) directly furthering the underlying public interest
purpose of the EEO rule_the increased hiring and promotion of minorities and women in the broadcast industry. Specifically,
if we had the legal authority to do so, I would have voted for a program that would have allowed monies received as a result
of violations or alleged violations of our EEO or other rules to be placed into a fund and not into the Federal Treasury.
Funds received for EEO violations would be used for training, educating, and providing placement services for minorities
and women interested in a career in broadcast. What better use for the $325,000 in forfeitures imposed for violations
of the EEO rules today than for the very purpose underlying the rule?

<DOCTITLE>Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; Request for an Exemption From Tying Provisions</DOCTITLE>


Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio (Banc One), has requested, pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company
Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971 

et seq.

) (Section 106(b)), that the Board grant an exemption to permit Banc One's subsidiary banks to vary the consideration
on a loan, deposit, discount, or trust service (``traditional banking products'') for customers that receive first
lien mortgage loans on 1-4 family residential real estate (mortgage loans) from Banc One's mortgage subsidiary,
Banc One Mortgage Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana (BOMC). Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit
BOMC to vary the consideration on mortgage loans for customers who have obtained or will obtain a traditional banking
product from any of Banc One's subsidiary banks. BOMC originates and refinances mortgage loans, primarily for sale
into the secondary market.
In 1994, Banc One intends to reorganize BOMC as an operating subsidiary of Bank One, Indianapolis, N.A., Indianapolis,
Indiana. In this connection, Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit its banks and BOMC to continue to offer
customers the price reductions described above after the reorganization. 
Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition
that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank
from engaging in these same activities on condition that the customer obtain any additional credit or services from
any affiliate. The Board may grant an exception that is not contrary to the purposes of this provision.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>


<FOOTNOTE>

See, e.g.

, 12 U.S.C. 1972(1).
</FOOTNOTE>


Banc One contends that its proposal is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because the proposal is not anticompetitive.
Banc One argues that the market for mortgage loans and for traditional banking products is highly competitive, and
that BOMC does not have sufficient market share on a local, nationwide, or other basis to adversely affect competition.
Banc One also argues that the proposal will promote competition and will not limit the availability of products to
consumers because the traditional banking products offered by Banc One's subsidiary banks and mortgage loans from
BOMC will be separately available to customers. 
Notice of Banc One's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented
by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards
of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than April 15, 1994.

<ACTION>
action:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The 1995 White House Conference on Aging (WHCOA) intends to recognize local and regional activities, events and programs
developed by outside organizations during 1994. Recognition implies the WHCOA's acknowledgement of the relevancy
of the activity to the goals of the WHCOA. Interested organizations must adhere to the guidelines listed below to have
an event officially recognized by the White House Conference on Aging.


</SUMMARY>
<ADDRESS>
addresses:

 Forms should be sent to the WHCOA, 501 School St. SW., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20024.


</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 A White House Conference on Aging is intended to produce policy recommendations to guide national aging policy over
the next decade. In Public Law 102&hyph;375, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992, Congress specifically identified
six primary purposes for the White House Conference on Aging. They are:


(1) To increase public awareness of the interdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older
individuals to society for the well-being of all generations;
(2) To identify the problems facing older individuals and the commonalities of the problems with problems of younger
generations;
(3) To examine the well-being of older individuals, including the impact the wellness of older individuals has on
our aging society;
(4) To develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate
for maintaining and improving the well-being of the aging;
(5) To develop recommendations for the coordination of Federal policy with State and local needs and the implementation
of such recommendations; and
(6) To review the status and multigenerational value of recommendations adopted at previous White House Conferences
on Aging.
It should be noted that particular emphasis should be directed to purposes 1 and 5 listed above.


Guidelines


In order for the White House Conference on Aging to consider recognizing a local activity, event or program, it must
meet the following basic criteria:
(A) It must be a policy-oriented event; the focus must be on one or more Federal policy issues affecting the elderly
or the near-elderly;
(B) It must guarantee the participation of older persons;
(C) It must produce a written report within 30&hyph;45 days summarizing major issues discussed and recommendations
proposed that can be utilized by the White House Conference on Aging;
(D) It must not be a profit-making or fundraising event although it is permissible to charge a fee to recover the costs
of the event; and
(E) It must be approved by the Executive Director. If the White House Conference on Aging agrees to recognize the event,
an official letter will be provided that could be presented at the activity, event or program. In certain limited instances,
the White House Conference on Aging may also be able to participate. A White House Conference on Aging recognition
allows the activity, event or program to publicize that it has been recognized by the WHCOA and that it will be listed
in the final report of the Conference. However, recognition does not imply that the WHCOA endorses the recommendations.
Interested organizations should respond to the questions set out in the appended form and send the information to
the above address as soon as possible. It will be reviewed and a response sent as expeditiously as possible.

Title:

 Evaluation of the Emergency Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services Demonstration. 



OMB No.:

 New Request. 



Description:

 The Emergency Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services Demonstration projects, funded by the National Center
on Child Abuse and Neglect of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), were designed to address services
to families experiencing the coexisting problems of substance abuse and child maltreatment. 

The national evaluation is comprised of two primary components_the Site Visit Interview Component and the Document
Review Component. The site visit data, in conjunction with information obtained from reviews of program reports
and third-party evaluation documents (obtained from the Document Review component) will be used to assess the extent
to which demonstration programs have met the goals of (1) developing emergency service delivery models to provide
crisis intervention for children and adolescents at risk for maltreatment from substance-abusing family members;
and (2) removing barriers to treatment for substance-abusing parents or family members in order to prevent maltreatment
of children in these at-risk households. The Site Visit Interview Component will be conducted through visits to 49
projects and interviews with key members at the project site. The information obtained by the Site Visit Interview
Component will be used by NCCAN in decision-making regarding policy and programs pertaining to services to children
and families experiencing the coexisting problems of substance abuse and child maltreatment. The information also
will provide the fields of substance abuse and child abuse prevention and intervention with new models for working
together and for serving families from a holistic perspective.

ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice lists HCFA manual instructions, substantive and interpretive regulations and other 

Federal Register

 notices, and statements of policy that were published during October, November, and December of 1993 that relate
to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Section 1871(c) of the Social Security Act requires that we publish a list of
Medicare issuances in the 

Federal Register

 at least every 3 months. Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing,
we are including all Medicaid issuances and Medicare and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed
and final) published during this timeframe. 


We are also providing the content of revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual published between October 1
and December 31, 1993. On August 21, 1989 (54 FR 34555), we published the content of the Manual and indicated that we
will publish quarterly any updates. Adding to this listing the complete text of the changes to the Medicare Coverage
Issues Manual allows us to fulfill this requirement in a manner that facilitates identification of coverage and other
changes in our manuals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Program Issuances 


The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which pay for health care and related services for 36 million Medicare beneficiaries and 33 million Medicaid recipients.
Administration of these programs involves (1) Providing information to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients,
health care providers, and the public; and (2) effective communications with regional offices, State governments,
State Medicaid Agencies, State Survey Agencies, various providers of health care, fiscal intermediaries and carriers
who process claims and pay bills, and others. To implement the various statutes on which the programs are based, we
issue regulations under authority granted the Secretary under sections 1102, 1871, and 1902 and related provisions
of the Social Security Act (the Act) and also issue various manuals, memoranda, and statements necessary to administer
the programs efficiently. 
Section 1871(c)(1) of the Act requires that we publish in the 

Federal Register

 at least every 3 months a list of all Medicare manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, and
guidelines of general applicability not issued as regulations. We published our first notice June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21730).
Although we are not mandated to do so by statute, for the sake of completeness of the listing of operational and policy
statements, we are continuing our practice of including Medicare substantive and interpretive regulations (proposed
and final) published during the 3-month timeframe. Since the publication of our quarterly listing on June 12, 1992
(57 FR 24797), we decided to add Medicaid issuances to our quarterly listings. Accordingly, we are listing in this
notice Medicaid issuances and Medicaid substantive and interpretive regulations published from October 1 through
December 30, 1993. 


II. Medicare Coverage Issues 


We receive numerous inquiries from the general public about whether specific items or services are covered under
Medicare. Providers, carriers, and intermediaries have copies of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, which identifies
those medical items, services, technologies, or treatment procedures that can be paid for under Medicare. On August
21, 1989, we published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (54 FR 34555) that contained all the Medicare coverage decisions issued in that manual. 
In that notice, we indicated that revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual will be published at least quarterly in the


Federal Register

. We also sometimes issue proposed or final national coverage decision changes in separate 

Federal Register

 notices. Readers should find this an easy way to identify both issuance changes to all our manuals and the text of changes
to the Coverage Issues Manual. 
Revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual are not published on a regular basis but on an as-needed basis. We publish revisions
as a result of technological changes, medical practice changes, responses to inquiries we receive seeking clarifications,
or the resolution of coverage issues under Medicare. If no Coverage Issues Manual revisions were published during
a particular quarter, our listing will reflect that fact. 
Not all revisions to the Coverage Issues Manual contain major changes. As with any instruction, sometimes minor clarifications
or revisions are made within the text. We have reprinted manual revisions as transmitted to manual holders. The new
text is shown in italics. We will not reprint the table of contents, since the table of contents serves primarily as
a finding aid for the user of the manual and does not identify items as covered or not. 


III. How To Use the Addenda 


This notice is organized so that a reader may review the subjects of all manual issuances, memoranda, substantive
and interpretive regulations, or coverage decisions published during the timeframe to determine whether any are
of particular interest. We expect it to be used in concert with previously published notices. Most notably, those
unfamiliar with a description of our Medicare manuals may wish to review Table I of our first three notices (53 FR 21730,
53 FR 36891, and 53 FR 50577) and the notice published March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16837), and those desiring information on
the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual may wish to review the August 21, 1989, publication. 
To aid the reader, we have organized and divided this current listing into five addenda. Addendum I identifies updates
that changed the Coverage Issues Manual. We published notices in the 

Federal Register

 that included the text of changes to the Coverage Issues Manual. These updates, when added to material from the manual
published on August 21, 1989, constitute a complete manual as of March 31, 1993. Parties interested in obtaining a
copy of the manual and revisions should follow the instructions in section IV of this notice.

Addendum II identifies previous 

Federal Register

 documents that contain a description of all previously published HCFA Medicare and Medicaid manuals and memoranda.

Addendum III of this notice lists, for each of our manuals or Program Memoranda, a HCFA transmittal number unique to
that instruction and its subject matter. A transmittal may consist of a single instruction or many. Often it is necessary
to use information in a transmittal in conjunction with information currently in the manuals. 
Addendum IV lists all substantive and interpretive Medicare and Medicaid regulations and general notices published
in the 

Federal Register

 during the quarter covered by this notice. For each item, we list the date published, the 

Federal Register

 citation, the title of the regulation, and the Parts of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which have changed. 
Addendum V sets forth the revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual that were published during the quarter
covered by this notice. For the revisions, we give a brief synopsis of the revisions as they appear on the transmittal
sheet, the manual section number, and the title of the section. We present a complete copy of the revised material,
no matter how minor the revision, and identify the revisions by printing in italics the text that was changed. If the
transmittal includes material unrelated to the revised section, for example, when the addition of revised material
causes other sections to be repaginated, we do not reprint the unrelated material. 


IV. How To Obtain Listed Material 


A. Manuals 


An individual or organization interested in routinely receiving any manual and revisions to it may purchase a subscription
to that manual. Those wishing to subscribe should contact either the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National
Technical Information Service (NTIS) at the following addresses: 



Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, ATTN: New Order, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250&hyph;7954,
Telephone (202) 783&hyph;3238, Fax number (202) 512&hyph;2250 (for credit card orders); or 
National Technical Information Service, Department of Commerce, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, Telephone
(703) 487&hyph;4630. 



In addition, individual manual transmittals and Program Memoranda listed in this notice can be purchased from NTIS.
Interested parties should identify the transmittal(s) they want. GPO or NTIS can give complete details on how to obtain
the publications they sell.

<TEXT>
 

B. Regulations and Notices 


Regulations and notices are published in the daily 

Federal Register

. Interested individuals may purchase individual copies or subscribe to the 

Federal Register

 by contacting the GPO at the address indicated above. When ordering individual copies, it is necessary to cite either
the date of publication or the volume number and page number. 
 

C. Rulings 


Rulings are published on an infrequent basis by HCFA. Interested individuals can obtain copies from the nearest HCFA
Regional Office or review them at the nearest regional depository library. We also sometimes publish Rulings in the


Federal Register

. 


D. HCFA's Compact Disk-Read Only Memory (CD&hyph;ROM) 


HCFA's laws, regulations, and manuals are now available on CD&hyph;ROM, which may be purchased from GPO or NTIS on
a subscription or single copy basis. The Superintendent of Documents list ID is HCLRM, and the stock number is 717&hyph;139&hyph;00000&hyph;3.
The following material is contained on the CD&hyph;ROM disk: 
&bull;Titles XI, XVIII, and XIX of the Act. 
&bull;HCFA-related regulations. 
&bull;HCFA manuals and monthly revisions. 
&bull;HCFA program memoranda.
The titles are current as of the September 1, 1992, update of the Compilation of the Social Security Laws and the regulations
are those in effect as of October 1, 1993. 
The CD&hyph;ROM disk does not contain Appendices M (Interpretative Guidelines for Hospices) and R (Resident Assessment
for Long Term Care Facilities) of the State Operations Manual. Copies of these appendices may be reviewed at a Federal
Depository Library (FDL). 
Any cost report forms incorporated in the manuals are included on the CD-ROM disk as LOTUS files. LOTUS software is
needed to view the reports once the files have been copied to a personal computer disk. 


V. How To Review Listed Material 


Transmittals or Program Memoranda can be reviewed at a local FDL. Under the FDL program, government publications
are sent to approximately 1400 designated libraries throughout the United States. Interested parties may examine
the documents at any one of the FDLs. Some may have arrangements to transfer material to a local library not designated
as an FDL. To locate the nearest FDL, individuals should contact any library. 
In addition, individuals may contact regional depository libraries, which receive and retain at least one copy of
most Federal government publications, either in printed or microfilm form, for use by the general public. These libraries
provide reference services and interlibrary loans; however, they are not sales outlets. Individuals may obtain
information about the location of the nearest regional depository library from any library. 
Superintendent of Documents numbers for each HCFA publication are shown in Addendum III, along with the HCFA publication
and transmittal numbers. To help FDLs locate the instruction, use the Superintendent of Documents number, plus the
HCFA transmittal number. For example, to find the Carriers Manual, Part 2_Program Administration (HCFA&hyph;Pub.
14&hyph;2) transmittal entitled ``The Contractor Performance Evaluation Program_FY 1993,'' use the Superintendent
of Documents No. HE 22.8/7&hyph;3, and the HCFA transmittal number 123. 


VI. General Information 


It is possible that an interested party may have a specific information need and not be able to determine from the listed
information whether the issuance or regulation would fulfill that need. Consequently, we are providing information
contact persons to answer general questions concerning these items. Copies are not available through the contact
persons. Copies can be purchased or reviewed as noted above. 
Questions concerning Medicare items in Addenda III may be addressed to Margaret Cotton, Office of Issuances, Health
Care Financing Administration, Room 688 East High Rise, 6325 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21207, Telephone (410)
966&hyph;5260. 
Questions concerning Medicaid items in Addenda III may be addressed to Pat Prete, Medicaid Bureau, Office of Medicaid
Policy, Health Care Financing Administration, Room 233 East High Rise, 6325 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21207,

Addendum V_Medicare Coverage Issues Manual 



(For the reader's convenience, new material and changes to previously published material are in italics. If any part
of a sentence in the manual instruction has changed, the entire line is shown in italics. The transmittal includes
material unrelated to revised sections. We are not reprinting the unrelated material.)

 


Transmittal No. 65; section 65&hyph;15, Artificial Hearts and Related Devices_Not Covered. CHANGED IMPLEMENTING
INSTRUCTIONS_EFFECTIVE DATE; Services Furnished on or After 10/18/93. 

Section 65&hyph;15, Artificial Hearts and Related Devices, is revised to provide coverage of the FDA-approved ventricular
assist device (known as the BVS 5000) when used only in patients suffering from postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction.
The device is intended for short term use and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. 



65&hyph;15 ARTIFICIAL HEARTS AND RELATED DEVICES_NOT COVERED 



There are several devices either in use or under development which replace all or part of the human heart or assist the
heart in performing its pumping function. Artificial hearts are considered investigational and not covered under
Medicare either when used as a permanent replacement for a human heart or when used as temporary life-support systems
(i.e., until a human heart becomes available for transplant). 



The FDA-approved ventricular assist device (known as the BVS 5000) is covered when it is used in accordance with its
FDA-approved labeled uses for postcardiotomy ventricular dysfunction. The device is intended for short term use
and is not covered when used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Other ventricular assist devices used as temporary
life-support systems are still considered investigational and not covered under the Medicare program. 

Transmittal No. 66; section 60&hyph;4.B, Medical Documentation. CHANGED PROCEDURES_EFFECTIVE DATE: Services
furnished on or after 01/01/9. 

Section 60&hyph;4.B, Medical Documentation, is revised to reflect changes mandated by &sect;4152 of OBRA 1990,
effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 1991. Implementing changes were published in the Medicare
Carriers Manual in July 1991 (transmittal 1399). Transmittal No. 66; section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence.
CHANGED PROCEDURES_EFFECTIVE DATE: 10/27/93. 

Section 60&hyph;4.C, Laboratory Evidence, is revised to indicate that in situations where the arterial blood gas
and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting, the
arterial blood gas study is the preferred service of documenting medical need because the results of such studies
are considered the best evidence of hypoxemia. In addition, these instructions also clarify that the prohibition
against the use of results of tests performed by a durable medical equipment (DME) supplier to qualify patients for
home oxygen service 

does not extend 

to the results of an arterial blood gas text by a hospital certified to conduct such tests. 



60&hyph;4 HOME USE OF OXYGEN 



B. 

Medical Documentation._Initial 

claims for oxygen services must include a completed Form HCFA&hyph;484 (Attending Physician's Certification of
Medical Necessity for Home Oxygen Therapy) to establish whether coverage criteria are met and to ensure that the oxygen
services provided are consistent with the physician's prescription or other medical documentation. The attending
physician's prescription or other medical documentation must indicate that the other forms of treatment (e.g.,
medical and physical therapy directed at secretions, bronchospasm and infection) have been tried, have not been
sufficiently successful, and oxygen therapy is still required. While there is no substitute for oxygen therapy,
each patient must receive optimum therapy before long-term home oxygen therapy is ordered. Use Form HCFA&hyph;484
for recertifications. (See Medicare Carriers Manual &sect;3312 for completion of Form HCFA&hyph;484.) 



The medical and prescription information on Form HCFA&hyph;484 can be completed only by the attending physician
or entered on the form from information in the patient's records by an employee of the physician for the physician's
review and signature. Although hospital discharge coordinators, nurses, and medical social workers may assist
in arranging for physician-prescribed home oxygen, they have no authority to prescribe the services or to enter medical
or prescription information in items 1 through 6 of Form HCFA&hyph;484. Suppliers may not enter this information
either. 

Unlike other types of DME, a physician's certification of medical necessity for oxygen equipment must include the
results of specific testing before coverage can be determined.

<TEXT>
 

Initial claims for oxygen must also be supported by medical documentation. Separate documentation is used with electronic
billing. (See Medicare Carriers Manual, Part 3, &sect;4105.6.) 

This documentation may be in the form of a prescription written by the patient's attending physician who has recently
examined the patient (normally within a month of the start of therapy) and must specify: 

&bull;A diagnosis of the disease requiring home use of oxygen; 

&bull;The oxygen flow rate; and 

&bull;An estimate of the frequency, duration of use (e.g., 2 liters per minute, 10 minutes per hour, 12 hours per day),
and duration of need (e.g., 6 months or lifetime).

 




Note: 

A prescription for ``Oxygen PRN'' or ``Oxygen as needed'' does not meet this last requirement. Neither provides any
basis for determining if the amount of oxygen is reasonable and necessary for the patient.

 


All claims with oxygen flow rates of more than 2 liters per minute must be reviewed by a carrier's medical staff before
payment can be made. The attending physician may also specify the type of oxygen delivery system to be used (i.e., gas,
liquid, or concentrator). If the type of system is specified, then the medical reasons for selecting that system over
the alternative systems must also be specified. 

New medical documentation written by the patient's attending physician must be submitted to the carrier in support
of revised oxygen requirements when there has been a change in the patient's condition and need for oxygen therapy.


Carriers are required to conduct periodic, continuing medical necessity reviews on patients whose conditions warrant
these reviews and on patients with indefinite or extended periods of necessity as described in Medicare Carriers
Manual, Part 3, &sect;4105.6.C. When indicated, carriers may also request documentation of the results of a repeat
arterial blood gas or oximetry study.

 




Note: 

Section 4152 of OBRA 1990 requires earlier recertification and retesting of oxygen patients who begin coverage with
an arterial blood gas result at or above a partial pressure of 55 or an arterial oxygen saturation percentage at or above
89. (See Medicare Carriers Manual &sect;4105.6 for certifications and retesting schedules.)

 


C. Laboratory Evidence._Initial claims for oxygen therapy must also include the results of a blood gas study that
has been ordered and evaluated by the attending physician. This is usually in the form of a measurement of the partial
pressure of oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood. (See Medicare Carriers Manual, Part 3, &sect;2070.1 for instructions
on clinical laboratory tests.) A measurement of arterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse oximetry, however,
is also acceptable when ordered and evaluated by the attending physician and performed under his or her supervision
or when performed by a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services. In situations when the arterial blood
gas and the oximetry studies are both used to document the need for home oxygen therapy and the results are conflicting,
the arterial blood gas study is the preferred source of documenting medical need. A DME supplier is not considered
a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services for purposes of these guidelines. This prohibition does
not extend to the results of an arterial blood gas test conducted by a hospital certified to do such tests. 

The conditions under which the laboratory tests are performed must be specified in writing and submitted with the
initial claim, i.e., at rest, while sleeping, while exercising, on room air, or if while on oxygen, the amount, body
position during testing, and similar information necessary for interpreting the evidence as specified by the carrier.


The preferred sources of laboratory evidence are existing physician and/or hospital records that reflect the patient's
medical condition. Since it is expected that virtually all patients who qualify for home oxygen coverage for the first
time under these guidelines have recently been discharged from a hospital where they submitted to arterial blood
gas tests, the carrier needs to request that such test results be submitted in support of their initial claims for home
oxygen. If more than one arterial blood gas test is performed during the patient's hospital stay, the test result obtained
closest to the hospital discharge date is the best evidence of the need for home oxygen therapy. 

Carriers may accept an attending physician's statement of recent hospital test results for a particular patient,
when appropriate, in lieu of copies of actual hospital records. Subsequent blood gas tests that appear to duplicate
the hospital test (e.g., when there is no reason to believe the patient's condition may have changed) are denied as
not medically reasonable and necessary. 

A repeat arterial blood gas or oximetry study is normally necessary only when evidence indicates that an oxygen recipient
has undergone a major change relevant to home use of oxygen. For example, if the carrier has reason to believe that there
has been a major change in the patient's physical condition (e.g., when there has been a significant increase in the
amount of oxygen billed on a monthly basis), it may ask for documentation of the results of another blood gas or oximetry
study.

<DOCTITLE>Final Strategic Directions for Cooperative Agreements for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Regional
Education and Training Centers Program for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), announces the final strategic directions to continue
the development of the AIDS Regional Education and Training Centers (AETCs) program for one year. This program is
authorized under Section 776(a), (previously section 788A), title VII of the Public Health Service Act (the Act),
as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October
13, 1992. 


Eligibility and Purpose 


Awards are made to accredited public and nonprofit private entities and schools and academic health science centers
in meeting the costs of projects_
1. To train the faculty of schools and graduate departments or programs of, medicine, nursing, osteopathic medicine,
dentistry, public health, mental health practice (clinical psychology, clinical social work and marriage and family
therapy), and allied health, to teach health professions students to provide for the health care needs of individuals
with HIV disease; 
2. To train practitioners to provide for the health care needs of such individuals; 
3. With respect to improving clinical skills in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of such disease, to educate
and train the health professionals and clinical staff of schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, and dentistry;
and 
4. To develop and disseminate curricula and resource materials relating to the care and treatment of individuals
with such disease and the prevention of the disease among individuals who are at risk of contracting the disease. 


Project Requirements 


The following project requirements, which were published in the 

Federal Register

 in FY 1989, after public comment dated September 8, 1989, 54 FR 37378, will be continued in FY 1994. 
The project requirements are designed to direct Federal resources where the greatest needs exist. Each project must
define a geographic region and identify the types of providers to be targeted for training within that region. Thus,
the focus in FY 1994 will continue to be on clinical education of primary care providers in high HIV/AIDS prevalence
areas. Consistent with this emphasis is the requirement that a minimum of two-thirds of the Federal funds provided
must be expended to provide education to primary care providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, dentists, physician
assistants, nurse practitioners, and dental hygienists). In addition, at least 50 percent of project funds must
be expended for training activities in high AIDS incidence Metropolitan Statistical Areas identified prior to the
competitive awards of high AIDS incidence MSAs identified for funding through the ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT program.

Each ETC must provide or perform the following: 
&bull;Clinical training of primary care physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants, 
nurse practitioners, and dental 
hygienists; 
&bull;Training of other health professionals 
such as mental health care providers and 
case managers; 
&bull;An updated needs-assessment of the education 
and training needs of the primary care providers 
within the proposed service area which is linked 
to the allocation of Federal funds; 
&bull;Training in risk assessment, prevention, early 
intervention, and treatment; 
&bull;Development of primary/tertiary care linkages and 
networking; 
&bull;Outreach to minorities, including involvement of minority providers, minority professional organizations,
and minority health care delivery 
systems; 
&bull;Linkages to ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT, titles I, II, 
III, and IV funded health services programs and the Hemophilia and Pediatric/Family HIV Health Care Demonstration
Programs; 
&bull;Linkage to PHS funded migrant (Sec. 329(a)(1)) and 
community health (Sec. 330(a)) centers, health care for the homeless programs (Sec. 340) State and local health agencies
and health care 
facilities involved in providing care for HIV infected individuals; 
&bull;Linkage with substance abuse programs; 
&bull;Collaboration with health professions organizations in the proposed region; 
&bull;Networking with other community agencies to 
concentrate on filling the gaps in training; 
&bull;Dissemination of state-of-the-art information 
and educational materials in concert with other 
PHS agencies, using mechanisms such as hotlines; 
&bull;Program assessment and data collection on program and trainees which can be used for regional and 
national evaluative purposes; and 
&bull;Plan for future non-Federal funding of project.

Collaboration 


The AETCs must operate in collaboration with health professions schools, community hospitals, health departments,
PHS funded Area Health Education Centers, ``Ryan White'' CARE ACT funded health services programs, the Hemophilia
and Pediatric/Family HIV Health Care Demonstration Programs, Health Care for the Homeless programs, community
and migrant health centers, and with substance abuse programs, community-based organizations, and other organizations
involved in the provision of care to people with HIV/AIDS related conditions. 
AETC projects also are encouraged to collaborate with the national network of AIDS Clinical Trial Units (ACTUs) and
the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
of the National Institutes of Health, and with other community based clinical trials sponsored by foundations such
as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation or the American Foundation for AIDS Research. It is also suggested that projects
collaborate with the NIAID Pediatric Clinical Trials Centers. 


Degree of Federal Involvement Agreement 


Substantial involvement will occur in the following areas: 
&bull;The design or direction of activities to develop a 
clinically-oriented training delivery model, with 
special emphasis for minority providers and providers 
who serve minority populations; 
&bull;The approval of key AETC project staff with particular 
emphasis on recruitment of minority faculty; 
&bull;The review of major contracts and agreements with 
subcontractors; 
&bull;The dissemination of state-of-the-art diagnostic and 
therapeutic clinical guidelines and algorithms, with a 
particular emphasis on early intervention strategies, 
which will include antiretroviral therapy, prophylaxis 
for opportunistic infections, and immunizations for viral and bacterial pathogens. 


Review Criteria 


The review criteria stated below, which were established in 
the 

Federal Register

 in FY 1989, dated September 8, 1989, 54 FR 37378, after public comment, will be continued in FY 1994. 
Applications will be reviewed and rated according to the applicant's ability to meet the following: 
l. The potential effectiveness of the project in carrying 
out the purposes of the program; 
2. The degree to which the project plan adequately 
provides for meeting the project requirements; 
3. The capability of the applicant to conduct the proposed 
activities in a cost efficient manner; 
4. The soundness of the fiscal plan for assuring effective 
utilization of funds; and 
5. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the period of support. 


Final Strategic Directions for AETC Program 


The AIDS Education Training Centers program was initially designed to provide information on the prevalence of AIDS
and identification of groups at increased risk of HIV infection. As the HIV/AIDS epidemic matured, it became apparent
that the AETCs had to shift their priorities from HIV/AIDS information transfer to more intensive clinical training.
This shift was necessitated by the introduction of new therapeutic interventions, such as antiretroviral therapies,
which offered the promise of delaying the onset of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. The mission of
the AETCs is to address the ever increasing issues surfacing because of the changes in the HIV epidemic by constantly
adding new priorities to address new issues. The Bureau of Health Professions and the Division of Medicine have developed
new strategic directions which will have to be more fully incorporated into the priorities of the AETC program. These
strategic directions were published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 on November 18, 1993, 58 FR 60860. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. These strategic directions
will include an emphasis on generalism, a continued emphasis on minorities and the underserved and an 
emphasis on interdisciplinary training. The AETCs will continue to provide multidisciplinary training for primary
health care personnel in the care of people with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and other conditions
related to infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Alamosa and Socorro Springsnails for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the Alamosa springsnail (

Tryonia alamosae

) and the Socorro springsnail (

Pyrgulopsis noemexicana

) which the Service listed as endangered species on September 30, 1991 (56 FR 43649). These two species occur in slow-velocity
water near thermal springheads and/or associated springruns in Socorro County, New Mexico. The Service solicits
review and comment from the public on this draft plan.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before May 16, 1994 to receive consideration by the Service.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Persons wishing to review the draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting the State Supervisor, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, New Mexico Ecological Services State Office, 3530 Pan American Highway NE., suite D, Albuquerque,
New Mexico 87107. Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to the State Supervisor at

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
The Alamosa springsnail and Socorro springsnail were listed as endangered on October 30, 1991. The draft recovery
plan includes new scientific information about the two species gathered since 1991 and provides management procedures
for protecting their habitat and expanding their range and abundance to the extent that no natural or human-caused
disturbance will result in irrevocable losses.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan.


Authority


The Authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533 (f).

<USBUREAU>National Park Service</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice and Public Comment on Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Park Service, Interior.




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that Chapters 6, 7, 8 and 11 of NPS&hyph;48 (``The Concessions Guideline'') have been rescinded
effective as of the date of this publication. In addition, any portions of NPS&hyph;48 or other NPS policies which
are inconsistent with recently amended National Park Service regulations for concession contracting and its new
standard language concession contract are hereby rescinded. Matters previously addressed by Chapters 6, 7, 8 and
11 of NPS&hyph;48 are now addressed to the extent necessary by a new National Park Service internal staff manual entitled
``Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines'' effective as of the date of this publication. The Sample Prospectus
and Related Guidelines is incorporated by reference in this public notice. The document includes, among other matters,
a sample prospectus for solicitation of offers for National Park Service concession contracts and permits, related
evaluation guidelines, and application information and criteria. It is noted, however, that notwithstanding these
actions, any solicitations for concession contracts and permits issued before the date of this publication will
continue to be processed in accordance with applicable provisions of NPS&hyph;48.
 


As an internal staff manual, notice of the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines is not required to be published
in the 

Federal Register

 nor is public comment on it required to be sought. However, in order to assure that the views of all interested parties
are considered, the National Park Service is seeking public comment on its Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines
document and will consider all comments received and amend the document appropriately if public comments so warrant.
Delaying the effective date of this document until after consideration of public comments is not in the public interest
as there exists a large backlog of NPS concession contract renewals which are necessary to complete to allow the commencement
of major renovation and construction programs in areas of the national park system, including improvements necessary
to protect the health and safety of park visitors and NPS and concessioner employees. In addition, many concessioners
are now operating under the terms of expired contracts and are, accordingly, in need of contract renewal actions as
soon as possible to permit business planning, actions and investments which require the existence of a new contract
for implementation. It is also noted that the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines document is intended to provide
guidance to NPS personnel concerning possible means to implement new policies and procedures adopted in the new NPS
concession contracting regulations and new standard language concession contract, both of which were adopted after
extensive public comment periods and consideration by NPS of all comments received. Further public comment in advance
of implementation of this internal staff manual is therefore not considered necessary and is impracticable if the
contract renewal process is to commence in a timely manner.

The Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines document is intended to be only a sample document. It is not meant to be
a document which must be used as written in every instance. It may be modified as appropriate to fit the needs of individual
situations. Further, this document is expected to be modified and refined over time as experience indicates that
changes are needed and to meet the changing needs of the concession contracting program.




</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments on the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines must be submitted on or before the sixtieth day following
publication of this notice.




</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Copies of the Sample Prospectus and Related Guidelines may be obtained by writing the Director, National Park Service,
Washington, DC 20240 and written comments should be sent to this same address.

Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, announces proposed availability
of Fiscal Year (FY) 94 funds to support a limited number of research grants to educational institutions. These funds
may also be used to support professional meetings and conferences for the exchange and transfer of research concepts
and findings related to the safety of nuclear power production. 



The FY 94 ceiling for research grants to educational institutions is approximately $1,218,000.00. Of this amount,
approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new grants. Because of this limitation, proposed grant budgets
should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding $100,000.00 over a two-year
period. Proposals for new FY 94 research grants should be submitted between the date of this Notice and May 20, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 



On November 27, 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice that announced the proposed availability of FY 93 funds for the NRC Grant Program. The NRC is revising that
notice to provide information on their grant program for FY 94. 



Scope and Purpose of This Announcement



Pursuant to Section 31.a and 141.b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research proposes to support educational institutions, nonprofit entities, state and local governments, and professional
societies through providing funds for expansion, exchange and transfer of knowledge, ideas, and concepts directed
toward the NRC safety research program. The program includes, but is not limited to, support of professional meetings
and conferences. In addition, the NRC has a limited amount for research grants to educational institutions (see topics
below). The FY 94 ceiling for these grants is approximately $1,218,000.00 with approximately $871,000.00 of this
amount available for new grants. 

The purpose of this program is to stimulate research to provide a technological base for the safety assessment of system
and subsystem technologies used in nuclear power applications. The results of this program will be to increase public
understanding relating to nuclear safety, to pool the funds of theoretical and practical knowledge and technical
information, and ultimately to enhance the protection of the public health and safety. In addition, each grant to
an educational institution should contain elements which will potentially benefit the graduate research program
of the institution, e.g., graduate student training. 

The NRC encourages educational institutions to submit research grant proposals in the following areas: 

1. Experiments and predictive modeling for thermal stratification, thermal stripping and flow-induced vibration
in plant fluid systems. 

2. Evaluation and modeling of phenomena associated with the addition of cooling water to a degraded core during various
stages of a severe accident.

3. Modeling and experimentation on two-phase flow, interfacial relations, and heat transfer in reactor coolant
systems. Experiments in modeling of passive heat transfer in natural circulation systems.
4. Development of condensation models for thermal-hydraulic systems codes with and without condensible gases.
5. Conduct experimentation and model development of the boron in reactor coolant systems under natural circulation
conditions.
6. Development and validation of a standard model of human performance in (a) nuclear power plant operations and maintenance,
(b) medical uses of by-product materials, and (c) industrial uses of by-product materials.
7. Develop and codify pragmatic, statistically valid methods for updating severe accident frequency and consequence
analysis to reflect results of new operational, experimental and calculation data.
8. Develop methods and comparison of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) results with operational data and experience.
9. Studies of corrosion processes that lead to degradation of materials in light-water reactor components such as
piping, reactor internals, and steam generators.
10. Development of nondestructive testing methods for in-situ evaluation of material properties and property degradation
due to aging, such as fracture toughness, fatigue, residual life, and radiation effects.
11. Development of and/or validation of models to predict the propagation of seismic ground motion in Central and
Eastern United States including the effects of ground motions on the response of NPPs and their site characteristics.
12. Development and/or validation of models to explain the quaternary tectonics and seismicity of the Central and
Eastern United States (East of 105 degrees W).
13. Development of techniques and QA and QC procedures necessary for rapid bioassay analysis in the event of accidental
internal exposure.
14. Studies of volcanism or other disruptive processes or events in the Basin and Range.
15. Development of improved instrumentation or techniques for measuring activity, radiation dose, and dose rates,
especially from small radioactive particles.
16. Research on the metabolism of radionuclides and their compounds relative to the calculation of internal dose.
17. Investigation of radiation induced effects at the cellular/molecular levels and repairs thereof emphasizing
the reduction of uncertainties in risk of deleterious health effects from low-level radiation.
18. Validation of approaches to quantitatively assess human health effects of radiation, including new approaches
to analyses of human epidemiological studies and experimental animal studies.
19. Analysis of the effectiveness of decontamination technologies for land, structures, recycled materials and
equipment and estimation of individual comparative costs.
20. Investigations, including natural analogue studies for long-term analyses, of coupling between hydrologic,
thermal, chemical, and/or mechanical processes as they affect the simulation of high-level waste repository performance.
21. Development of methods to apply safety goal philosophy, including risk-based regulation.

Eligible Applicants


Educational institutions, nonprofit entities, State and Local governments, and professional societies are eligible
to apply for a grant under this announcement.


Factors Generally Indicating Support Through Grants


The NRC's benefit from the results of grants should be no greater than for other interested parties, i.e., the public
must be the primary beneficiary of the work performed. Surveys, studies, or research which provide specific information
or data necessary for the NRC to exercise its regulatory or research mission responsibilities will not be funded by
a grant. Applicants requesting support for work which has a direct regulatory application should submit their requests
as an unsolicited proposal for consideration as a contract rather than a grant.
1. The primary purpose of NRC grants is to support the development of knowledge or understanding of the subject or phenomena
under study.
2. The exact course of the work and its outcome are usually not defined precisely, and specific points in time for achievement
of significant results need not be specified.
3. The NRC desires that the nature of the proposed investigation be such that the recipient will bear prime responsibility
for the conduct of the research and exercise judgment and original thought toward attaining the scientific goals
within broad parameters of the proposed research areas and the resources provided.
4. Meaningful technical reports (as distinguished from Semi-Annual Status Reports) can be prepared only as new findings
are made, rather than on a predetermined time schedule.
5. Simplicity and economy in execution and administration are mutually desirable.


Proposal Format


Proposals should be concise and provide a thorough understanding of the proposed project. Neither unduly elaborate
applications nor voluminous supporting documentation is desired.
State and local governments shall submit proposals utilizing the standard forms specified in Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;102 (Revised), Paragraph 6.c). Nonprofit organizations, universities, and professional
societies shall submit proposals utilizing the standard forms stipulated in OMB Circular A-110, (Attachment M).
The format used for project proposals should give a clear presentation of the proposed project and its relation to
the specific objectives contained in this notice. Each proposal should follow the format outlined below unless the
NRC specifically authorizes exception.

Proposal Submission and Deadline



This notice is valid for Federal Government Fiscal Year 94 (October 1, 1998 to September 30, 1994). Potential grantees
are advised, however, that due to the limited funding available for new research grants to educational institutions,
such proposals received after May 20, 1994, will be considered for FY94 funding to the extent practicable.



Funds



For Fiscal Year 94, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, anticipates
making a total of approximately $1,218,000.00 available for funding research grants to educational institutions.
Of this amount, approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new research grants in FY94. Because of this limitation,
proposed grant budgets should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding
$100,000.00 over a period of two years.

<DOCTITLE>Quivira Mining Co.; Ambrosia Lake Mill</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to amend Source Material License SUA&hyph;1473 to modify the erosion protection design of the plan
for reclamation of the Ambrosia Lake Mill disposal area, and Notice of Opportunity to request a hearing.







1. Proposed Action



By letter dated January 7, 1994, Quivira Mining Company (QMC), holder of Source Material License SUA&hyph;1473 for
the Ambrosia Lake Mill, requested an amendment to License Condition No. 37 to; (1) Eliminate having to open a new rock
quarry and its related surface disturbance; (2) improve the erosion protection for the tailings impoundments; and
(3) reduce the volume of waste rock generated at the crusher and thereby reduce the disturbance in that area.



2. Reason for Request To Amend License



License Condition No. 37 describes requirements that the licensee must comply with in reclaiming the site. As discussed,
below, QMC is requesting modifications to this license condition.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires that rock used for erosion protection have the ability to withstand
the forces of weathering for long periods of time. In accordance with this requirement, in the approved reclamation
plan, QMC provided evidence that rock from an area known as La Chuchilla Ridge would meet the NRC criteria. To assure
that this rock source is actually used to obtain rock for erosion protection, License Condition No. 37(J) specifically
mentions that erosion protection materials must be obtained from La Chuchilla Ridge. QMC is requesting that License
Condition 37(J) be revised to allow them to obtain rock from an existing quarry near the Homestake Mill in order to prevent
having to disturb the La Chuchilla Ridge area. The durability of rock at the Homestake Quarry has been shown to be equivalent
to the rock from La Chuchilla Ridge.

License Condition No. 37(K) specifies the gradation and sizing requirements of the rock to be used for erosion protection.
For the outslopes of Ponds 1 and 2, four sizes of rock are required depending on where the rock is to be placed. In order
not to have to process four different gradation sizes, QMC proposes to use larger rock than required in two areas of
the outslopes. This would not only improve the erosion protection design, but would also reduce the disturbance in
the area.

The approved reclamation plans does not require rock for erosion protection of the top surfaces of Ponds 1 and 2 as the
surfaces are sufficiently flat to be stable under extreme flood conditions. QMC proposes to be allowed to place rock
on the top surfaces of the two ponds if they so desire. This request would also improve the erosion protection design.

Paragraph 10 CFR 51.22 (c)(11), categorically excludes the requirement for an environmental assessment for this
licensing action. That paragraph states that the categorical exclusion applies to the issuance of amendments to
licenses for uranium mills provided that (1) there is no significant change in the types or significant increase in
the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, (2) there is no significant increase in individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure, (3) there is no significant construction impact, and (4) there is no significant
increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological accidents.

The licensing action discussed in this memorandum meets these criteria as the proposed amendment involves only changes
in the erosion protection design. The proposed changes will provide larger rock than required in some areas, and will
eliminate disturbing a new area for obtaining rock by using an existing quarry. Neither of these changes will result
in adverse environmental impacts. An environmental report is not required from the licensee since the amendment
does not meet the criteria of 10 CFR 51.60 (b)(2).



3. Notice of Opportunity To Request Hearing



In accordance with title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, part 2 (10 CFR part 2), paragraph 2.1205(c)(1), interested
parties are hereby notified that they may request a hearing pursuant to the procedures set forth in 10 CFR 2.1205 within
thirty (30) days of the publication of this notice.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;139]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>The University of Washington; Consideration of Application for Renewal of Facility License</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73,
as a possession only license from the present operating license, issued to the University of Washington for the Argonaut
reactor located on the campus of the University in Seattle, Washington.

The renewal would extend the expiration date of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 to February 14, 1999, in accordance
with the licensee's timely application for renewal as a possession only license by letter dated August 3, 23 and 31,
1989 and as modified on February 14, 1994. The operating license was modified by Amendment No. 15 to the license on May
7, 1990, to not permit possession of fuel on the site since all fuel had been removed from the facility and returned to
its owner, the Department of Energy. The licensee is developing a plan to decommission the facility, and it is anticipated
that the term of renewal will be sufficient to complete decommissioning and terminate the license.

Prior to a decision to renew the license as a possession only license, the Commission will have made findings required
by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.

By April 18, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to renewal of the subject facility license
and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding
must file a written request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene. Requests for hearing and petitions for
leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing
Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. If a request
for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary of the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Fee Structure for the Mutual Fund Networking Service



March 10, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on January 26, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
from interested persons on the proposed rule change.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish a revised fee for providing the Mutual Fund Services Networking
position files. The proposed fee change will provide for a more equitable allocation of fees among members of NSCC.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In mid 1993, NSCC determined that the initially established fee structure for providing Mutual Fund Services Networking
position files was no longer appropriate. On August 18, 1993, NSCC filed a rule change
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which consisted of a waiver of $99 of the $100 fee charged to members for excess Networking position files. That filing
indicated that the waiver would continue while NSCC determined a more appropriate fee. The purpose of the proposed
rule change is to establish a revised fee for the Networking position records. The new fee structure is based on the
number of records received by a participating broker and the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on the system.
Effective January 1, 1994, for billing in February 1994, the new fee is $1.50 per thousand records received by a broker
in excess of the number of subaccounts the broker maintains on Networking. NSCC will not assess a charge when the difference
between these numbers is 5000 records or less in a month.

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed fee change will provide for a more equitable allocation of fees among members, so the proposed rule change
is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange; Notice of Proposed Rule Change Relating to Chinese Wall
Procedures for Specialists and Specialist Firms</DOCTITLE>



March 10, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 29, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE is proposing to adopt a set of Chinese Wall procedures relating to Exchange specialists and specialist firms.
The test of the proposed rule change is as follows:




Rule 4.19(a). A functional separation must be established (1) between a specialist firm and any associated approved
person; and (2) between a specialist and any associated integrated member organization. The approved person or integrated
member organization (collectively referred to as an ``affiliated upstairs firm'') must establish functional separation
(a ``Chinese Wall'') as appropriate to its operation and further establish, maintain and enforce written procedures
reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, which includes review of employee
and proprietary trading, memorization and documentation of procedures, substantive supervision of interdepartmental
communications by the Exchange specialist firm's Compliance Department and procedures concerning proprietary
trading when the firm is in possession of material, non-public information. The Exchange specialist firm or associated
integrated member organization must obtain the prior written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the
requirements above in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation and that it has established
proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation. A copy of these Chinese
Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange's Financial Compliance Department.

(b) The following are the minimum procedural and maintenance requirements:

(1) The specialist's book must be kept confidential in accordance with Rule 5.29(d).

(2) The affiliated upstairs firm can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions.

(3) Material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the affiliated upstairs firm from the issuer
may not be made available to the specialist.

(4) Clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in
such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated upstairs firm and specialist
entities.

(c) Information that may be made available to others.

(1) A broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm may make available to the specialist only the market information
that he or she would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal course of his or her trading and ``market
probing'' activity.

(2) A specialist may make known to a broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm only has the information about
market conditions in specialty stocks that he or she would make available in the normal course of specializing to any
other broker and in the same manner as it would make such information available to any other broker. The specialist
may make such market information available only upon request of the broker of the affiliated upstairs firm and may
not provide such information on its own initiative.

(3) An affiliated upstairs firm can popularize a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the
existence of possible conflicts of interest.

(d) A specialist who becomes privy to material, non-public information must communicate that fact promptly to his
or her firm's compliance officer or other designated official. The specialist shall seek guidance from the compliance
officer or other designated official as to what procedures the specialist should follow after receipt of such information
or such other action that should be taken. Appropriate records shall be maintained by the compliance officer or other
designated official. The record should include a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description
of the action taken by the compliance officer or other designated official. If the ``book'' is given up to another member
of the specialist firm who is not in possession of the information or an independent specialist firm, the book must
be transferred in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the material, non-public
information and the Exchange must be immediately informed and a record kept of the time the specialist reacquired
the book reflecting acknowledgement by the compliance officer that the reacquisition was appropriate.

(e) The Exchange has established the following procedures to monitor compliance with this rule:

(1) Examination of the Chinese Wall procedures established by Exchange specialist firms.

(2) Surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated upstairs firm and its affiliated specialist or
specialist firm.

Accordingly, the Exchange will conduct periodic examinations of the specialist firm's Chinese Wall procedures
to ensure that a functional separation between the affiliated upstairs firm and the specialist or specialist firm
has been created and thereafter maintained. The Exchange will also monitor the trading activities of affiliated
upstairs firms and affiliated specialists in the firms' specialty stock in order to monitor the possible trading
while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison reports
generated by the Exchange,

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office
of Management and Budget have commenced a project to identify, recommend and help implement specific reforms of the
regulatory process in order to ease the impact of government regulations on small businesses. Six Federal agencies
are participating in the initial phase of the project: The Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department
of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Food and Drug Administration.
The project will begin with a Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform to be held on March 17, 1994 in Washington, DC.
This Forum will consist of a panel of senior representatives from the six agencies, chaired by Erskine B. Bowles, Administrator
of the SBA, and Sally Katzen, Administrator of OIRA. They will listen to oral presentations from several members of
the small business community and from SBA's Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy. They also will be reviewing written
statements submitted by other business owners who were unable to present their remarks to the Forum panel in person.




The Forum will be followed by an examination of the cumulative impact of regulations on five designated industries,
representatives from various Federal regulatory agencies, with specific direction from those agencies participating
on the Forum panel. By this Notice, SBA and OIRA announce that they are seeking written comments from interested members
of the public to assist in successful completion of this project. These written comments will be considered by the
five industry working groups in preparing reports to be presented at a second Small Business Forum, to be held in late
June 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Written comments must be received by May 2, 1994. The second Forum will be held in late June 1994.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Written comments should be mailed to Doris Freedman, Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12866, issued on September 30, 1993, announces a government-wide commitment to regulatory reform
and meaningful public participation in the regulatory process and directs the development of ``streamlined regulatory
approaches for small businesses and other entities.'' To this end, SBA and OIRA have initiated a project to bring together
representatives of six Federal agencies for the purpose of identifying burdens imposed by present regulatory procedures
and the means by which the regulatory process can be altered to facilitate participation by small businesses.




Initially, the regulatory impact on small business of six Federal agencies will be examined: The Department of Labor,
the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal
Revenue Service, and the Food and Drug Administration. The burden of compliance with each agency's regulations will
be evaluated in terms of their individual and cumulative impact on small businesses in five discrete industry groups:
(1) Processing of food and related products; (2) trucking and transportation; (3) restaurants; (4) environmental
recycling and waste disposal; and (5) chemicals and metals.


A working group will be established for each of the five industry groups, composed of representatives from the six
participating agencies, as well as representatives from SBA, OIRA and other Federal agencies. Each working group
will meet over a ten-week period and will solicit the input and meaningful participation of small business owners,
small business trade associations, State and local governments, and other interested parties, via oral presentations
and written comments received during the initial 45 days of the ten-week period. Each working group will prepare a
report with specific recommendations for improvements in the regulatory process and in any specific regulations
which appear to affect the particular industry in an unduly burdensome way.


Extensive public participation is essential to this evaluative process. This participation will occur at the public
Forum on March 17, 1994, and the second Forum in June of 1994. Each Forum will hear from representatives selected from
various sectors of the small business community and will be attended by senior representatives from the six participating
agencies. These agencies have stated publicly their commitment to working with each other and with members of the
small business community toward the goal of regulatory reform.

Broader public participation in the form of written comments is also essential to this process and is being solicited
through this Notice. Comments received by May 2, 1994 will be considered by the five industry working groups in preparing
the reports which then will be presented by SBA at the second Forum. Public comments should be as specific as possible
and should focus on possible constructive solutions to any problems presented. Each submission should identify
the industry affected, so as to facilitate a referral to the appropriate industry working group. SBA, OIRA and the
participating agencies are particularly interested in comments concerning the following:




_Specific ways in which existing regulatory programs and the regulatory process can be made more ``user-friendly''
to small businesses. 

_Constructive suggestions for reducing forms and paperwork, particularly where they are duplicative, overly complicated
or otherwise burdensome for small businesses. 

_Effective ways to communicate with small business owners and to assist them in their understanding and implementation
of complex regulations. 

_Non-punitive methods for ensuring compliance with regulatory objectives or requirements, including preinspection
programs, advisory services, greater reliance on communication and dissemination of information, and industry
self-regulation.

_More effective ways to elicit participation from the private sector in efforts to simplify and clarify regulations
so that they are not overly complex or unduly difficult to interpret or implement. 

_Systematic ways to identify proposed regulations which are inconsistent with or duplicative of other regulations
of the issuing agency or other Federal agencies. 

_Suggestions for involving small business owners and their representatives in the rulemaking process in a more meaningful
way.




Written comments must be received no later than May 2, 1994, in order to be incorporated into the industry working group
reports to be presented at the second Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform to be held in late June 1994. Comments
which are received thereafter will be reviewed by SBA's Office of Advocacy and, to the extent feasible, will be transmitted
to the affected agencies for their review as well.

ACTION: 

Notice of meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard published, under this docket number, a notice of meeting and of availability of a study
on the safety of towing vessels. Now the Coast Guard has added topics to the agenda of that meeting: (1) Radar-observer
training for operators of uninspected towing vessels; (2) Coast Guard inspection of towing vessels; (3) manning
of towing vessels; (4) pilotage requirement for operators of towing vessels; (5) and evaluation of regulations on
retesting mariners. The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on the new topics as well as on the original agenda.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

(1) The meeting will still take place on Monday, April 4, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (2) Public comments on the agenda
as enlarged will still be accepted until May 4, 1994.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

(1) The meeting will be held at the Coast Guard Headquarters Building, room 2415, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington,
DC. (2) Two copies of public comments should be forwarded to: Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council, CGD 94&hyph;014,
U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (G&hyph;LRA. 3406), 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001.

SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994, to consider the study, ``Review of Marine Safety Issues
Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels'' conducted by the Coast Guard, and will seek public comment on the recommendations
identified in the study. The Coast Guard may use the study, along with public comment, to develop rules. Of particular
interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are measures that could provide the necessary means
to, and improve the navigational ability of, the operator; these measures include requiring the carriage of charts,
publications, and radar, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer.



The Coast Guard recognizes that there are insufficient facilities for radar-observer training immediately available
to accommodate all currently licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTVs). Therefore, the Coast Guard
is contemplating for these OUTVs: (a) An interim, short-term, training program, required soon, followed by (b) a
more extensive program leading to an endorsement as radar observer, required on or before the scheduled license renewal.
The Coast Guard is contemplating for new applicants, only the more extensive program.

Comments on the practicality and utility of these requirements, their costs, the content of both interim and extensive
courses, the length of time appropriate for implementation, and the administrative burden would be especially helpful.

Four of the topics that the Coast Guard has added_inspection, manning, pilotage of towing vessels, and evaluation
of retesting regulations_it added because of Congressional interest. This arose during the Secretary of Transportation's
testimony before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation, House of Representatives, on March 3, 1994.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments
should provide two copies, include their names and addresses, identify the study by docket number CGD 94&hyph;014,
and give the reason for each comment. Each person wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped,
self-addressed postcard or envelope.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;3; Notice 2]</RINDOCK>


Ford Motor Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance


Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, MI, determined that some of its replacement windshields failed to comply with
the labeling requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also petitioned to
be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15
U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on January 13, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR
1989).
Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that, with certain exceptions, glazing materials
for use in motor vehicles shall conform with Paragraphs S5, ``Requirements,'' S6, ``Certification and Marking,''
and ANS Z26.1.6, ``Marking of Safety Glazing Materials.'' Specifically, section 6 of ANSI Z26.1 states ``[G]lazing
materials, which in a single sheet of material are intentionally made with an area having a luminous transmittance
of not less than 70 percent (Test No. 2), adjoining an area that has less than 70 percent luminous transmittance, shall
be permanently marked at the edge of the sheet to show the limits of the area that is intended to comply with Test No. 2.
The markings shall be A

e

S1 or A

a

S2 etc. *&blank;*&blank;*''
Approximately 98,000 W1099V windshields manufactured from June 1992 through October 1993 and 14,800 W911V windshields
manufactured from August 1992 to June 1993 are missing the A

e

S1 marking at the bottom edge of the shade band. The subject windshields are manufactured as replacements for windshields
in 1980 through 1994 model year Ford F-Series and Bronco vehicles.
Ford supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:



The affected windshields were produced by a Ford supplier without A

e

S1 markings at the bottom edge of the shade band, but meet all other marking and performance requirements of Standard
No. 205 and ANSI Z26.1 including the appropriate AS1 marking in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction
of the glazing material.
[Ford believes that t]he omission of the marking presents no risk of accident or injury. Consequently in Ford's judgment,
the omission is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of [Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard] FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary
degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants
being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted, the affected windshields fully comply
with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205 and although missing the A

e

S1 marking at the bottom of the shade band, they do have the correct AS1 marking to indicate the type of construction
of the glazing material. Because all performance requirements are met, the omission of the marking at the shade band
has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any
complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.



No comments were received on the petition.
The noncompliance reported does not affect the performance characteristics of the glazing, and, hence, the noncompliance
has no direct effect upon motor vehicle safety. Although the markings have been omitted in one area of the windshield,
the correct designation, AS1, appears in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction of the glazing
material. Thus, the omission at the shade band will not prevent correct identification of the glazing by personnel
conducting periodic motor vehicle inspections, or when it is necessary to replace the windshield. There is no need
in either instance for knowledge of where the area of 70 percent or greater light transmittance begins.
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.

motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.
Double Decker Bus Company of Denver, Colorado (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;93&hyph;015) has petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses are eligible for importation into the United States. The
petitioner contends that these vehicles are eligible for importation under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the
Act, 15 US.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), because they have safety features that comply with, or are capable of being modified
to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life.


Overall authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended,
Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is to ``enable the Government of the United States
to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen
the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments,
and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly,
sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and
projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting
officer.



Overview


An ideal program would include the following elements: Direct services, community outreach programs, and workshops
that provide international students with an opportunity to experience the United States_its history, culture,
values, policies, and life-styles. Programs should support self-sponsored international students as well as Fulbright
students, teachers, senior scholars, and other participants in programs supported by USIA.



Guidelines

in English language and American business practices/culture. The IFLNN is a recognized leader throughout the New
Independent States in producing language specialists and providing in-service teacher training for students and
specialists from throughout the former Soviet Union. The IFLNN is working to develop interdisciplinary specialization

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The IFLNN program is authorized by the Freedom Support Act of 1992 and funded under the Foreign Appropriations Bill
of 1994.




Pursuant to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs' authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political
character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural
life.


Overview


The American Institute at the IFLNN will expand the pool of Russians qualified in English and familiar with Western
business practices, finance, management, commercial transactions, and the American political and economic system
as an environment for business. This program will provide up to $500,000 to support an institutional linkage with
the IFLNN for three (3) years; start date for the program should be September, 1994, with faculty in place in Nizhniy
Novgorod not later than October 1, 1994. The U.S. partner institution will assist with the development of faculty
and curriculum in the fields of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), business, and American studies. Program activities
will include faculty and post-graduate student exchanges (post-graduates must be on a ``faculty track,'' involved
with teaching at participating institutions), and some outreach to the U.S./Russian business communities to involve
them in developing appropriate business curricula. The U.S. partner must dedicate significant staff and faculty
time to the project. The program will be implemented primarily through a grant to an accredited four-year U.S. post-secondary
institution or consortium of accredited institutions and scholarly/professional associations.

Nizhniy Novgorod has been the setting for key economic and democratic reform in Russia. U.S. presence in the area is
growing, including Peace Corps volunteers, U.S. business interests, and visiting USG officials. The focus of the
U.S. effort has been to build a ``critical mass'' for reform among regional and local government officials, business
leaders and educators. One element of this critical mass includes English language training for Russians which can
be used in their professional fields. To this end, the IFLNN program will help train a pool of language-qualified professionals,
enabling them to take advantage of expanded opportunities for technical assistance, bilateral exchanges, other
government and private sector training programs, and commercial relations.



Program Objectives



The IFLNN program has three principal objectives: (1) To focus additional resources in support of democratic and
market reform in Nizhniy Novgorod. English language teaching and American studies will be used as vehicles to teach
business English and American business practices, and American forms of government.

(2) To establish a training center for faculty from other institutes of higher education. IFLNN's program will ``train
the trainers,'' emphasizing curriculum development, teacher training, and educational testing.

<PARENT> FR940317-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) To facilitate the creation of a linkage between IFLNN and U.S. institutions of higher learning that will continue
to flourish after U.S. Government funding has ceased to be available.



Grant Activities



To achieve program objectives, the grantee institution/consortium will: (1) Help develop a structure for interdisciplinary
training programs in English as a Foreign Language (EFL), business and management practices, and American studies
at the IFLNN.

(2) Conduct faculty and post-graduate student* exchanges in EFL, business, and American studies. Each exchange
of persons must be a minimum of one month; however, longer visits, especially those involving faculty, are encouraged
and are an important competitive factor. (*Post-graduate students must be on a faculty track and must not exceed 25%
of all participants).

(3) Provide for a U.S. faculty member who must be in residence in Nizhniy Novgorod for the duration of the program as
program director to ensure everyday oversight of program details.

(4) Arrange exchanges of other university personnel, including library and administrative officials.

(5) Implement exchanges of library materials.

(6) Develop new curricula and teaching materials, emphasizing content-area language instruction and EFL methodology
developments.

(7) Develop testing methods.

(8) Advise IFLNN administrators on management, budget, fundraising skills, and other areas needed to operate in
a decentralized environment.

(9) Undertake the translation and publication of texts, as well as the distribution of relevant publications.



Under Separate Funding, USIA Will Supplement Activities Conducted by the Grantee Institution and IFLNN With



(1) An English Foreign Language Fellow (EFLF), assigned by the USIA office in Moscow, who will serve for two years as
coordinator of U.S. Government-funded programs at IFLNN, including general oversight and monitoring. The EFLF
will serve as the U.S. Information Agency presence at, and liaison between departments within, the IFLNN. University
representatives must regularly consult with the EFLF regarding IFLNN activities.

(2) Fulbright lecturers, academic specialists, and other support for the IFLNN.

(3) The rights to Western texts which could be published locally.

(4) Support for a student advising office, to provide interested students with information about admissions, courses
of study, and other data regarding possible study in the United States, as well as information about other USG-funded
exchanges and training programs.

(5) An information center, which the USIA office in Moscow is in the process of establishing.

SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information Agency seeks applications from non-profit
organizations in the New York metropolitan area to coordinate and implement programs which enhance the experience
of self-sponsored international students attending colleges and universities in the New York City area. The organization
will develop programs that serve to familiarize international students with New York City's complex cultural, political,
and ethnic structures, and provide a bridge between the campus environment and American communities.



USIA anticipates awarding up to $35,000 for the implementation and coordination of these programs. This amount may
augment functions currently provided to international students by educational and other institutions.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be
balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Overall authority
for these programs is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law
87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase
mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen the
ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and
achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly,
sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and
projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting
officer.



Overview



Through a grant to a non-profit organization in the New York city metropolitan area, USIA seeks programs that would
enable self-sponsored international students to experience the United States: Its history, culture, values, 


 policies and lifestyles. Self-sponsored international students should be provided an opportunity to utilize the
city's resources productively; and to take an active role in city life. To understand more fully American life and
culture, students must be provided the opportunity to become personally involved with and understand ``typical''
American activities such as volunteerism, observance of national and religious holidays, and cultural and sports
events. In addition, self-sponsored international students should be encouraged to share their culture and knowledge
with American students at all levels. Also important are programs which introduce foreign students to the U.S. government
structure, the electoral process, the U.S. economy, business culture and trade issues, environmental protection,
the arts and American cultural heritage. A variety of approaches such as workshops, home hospitability, and community
outreach programs may be utilized. 


Enrichment programs should be designed not only to enhance international students' understanding of America's
cultural and ethnic diversity, but they should also enable the students to teach Americans their own cultural, ethnic,
political, and social diversity, thereby promoting mutual understanding and long-term friendships. This multicultural
component can be met by emphasizing interaction_interpersonal, intercultural communication_between students
and American citizens.

Another focus of this program could be to identify international students having leadership potential whose experience
in this program could make a substantial contribution to mutual understanding and communication between the U.S.
and their home countries in the future. In this regard, workshops to develop such leadership skills as public speaking
and conflict resolution for future international leaders should be included in the program. Organizations must
provide a program outline demonstrating their ability to enlist the participation of informed lecturers, keynote
speakers, and/or recognized experts whose credentials and experience are evidence of in-depth knowledge of workshop
topics.



Guidelines



Proposals should include a listing of names and titles, of the executive officer(s) of the organization and of the
person(s) directly responsible for the project. Resumes or curriculum vitae of key personnel should be provided.

Organizations should demonstrate the ability to recruit and maintain the necessary cadre of volunteers required
to participate in program events.



Proposed Budget



Organizations must submit a comprehensive line-item budget for which specific details are available in the application
packet. Budget will not exceed $35,000.

Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology invites proposals from qualified organizations for funding
for projects that accomplish any one of the following objectives:





Program Planning:

 To support the creation of a program plan for a state-wide, coordinated technology extension system to enhance the
competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturers through the application of technology.



Program Implementation:

 To support the initial implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension program or the pilot testing
of new program and service concepts to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance


The catalog number for the award of ``State Technology Extension Program'' funds in the Catalog of Federal Domestic
Assistance is 11.613.


Program Description


In accordance with the provisions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 2781), as amended,
NIST will provide assistance in fiscal year 1994 to help States develop manufacturing assistance programs aimed
at small and medium-sized manufacturers and help bring those State programs to a level of performance where they can
provide the full range of manufacturing extension services required by their manufacturers. Under the NIST Manufacturing
Extension Partnership (MEP), which includes the State Technology Extension Program (STEP), NIST will make merit-based
awards to States to help improve their planning, coordination, and implementation of their technology extension
activities. This funding will also be available to multi-state partnerships which seek to expand the scope of technology
assistance related services regionally available to small- and medium-sized manufacturers. MEP assumes a broad
definition of manufacturing, and recognizes a wide range of technology and concepts, including durable goods production;
chemical, biotechnology, and other materials processing; electronic component and system fabrication; and engineering
services associated with manufacturing, as lying within the definition of manufacturing.


Funding Availability


Approximately, $2,500,000 will be available to support cooperative agreements on a matching funds basis under this
program. Funding size will vary according to the project category and scope of work. For example, Program Planning
projects have typically averaged less than $100,000 in past years. Program Planning projects that include pilot
testing of the proposed extension plan or planning for multiple intrastate regions will be eligible for NIST funding
up to $150,000. For Program Implementation projects and Regional Linkage projects, awards will also vary, but NIST
funds may not exceed $250,000 per project. States will be able to submit proposals for each of the three project categories.


Award Period


The cooperative agreements entered into under this program will be available for one year. If an application is selected
for funding, DOC has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal
of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of DOC.


Indirect Costs


The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect
cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or
100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.

The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension
programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will
plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance
programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs;
into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services,
such as technology deployment, workers skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export
and market development.

Applicants may conduct planning activities on multiple intrastate region basis, when regions are defined by the
state. Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally
oriented, versus state-wide, and how the multiple intrastate regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or
interact such that state-wide coverage is achieved.

Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed
extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot test's success in implementing
the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the
state.

Project Objective


The purpose of Program Implementation projects is to support the implementation of comprehensive, state-wide industrial
extension programs and/or pilot testing of new program and service concepts, such as pilot outreach centers and other
extention activities, to help small and medium-sized manufacturers improve productivity and competitiveness.
For projects that support the implementation of a comprehensive state-wide industrial extension system, activities
must build upon existing services and be consistent with comprehensive state plans, if such plans exist. Extension
programs should provide access to a range of services, including but not limited to: technical extension, training,
manager assistance, and quality improvement.
Pilot testing of new services and activities will be permitted on a limited scale where there is an intent to replicate
these services on a larger scale or to move toward full-scale implementation. Accordingly, pilot testingmust include
evaluation, analysis and documentation, and may include some planning activities as necessary.
NIST plans to give priority consideration to projects having the best potential to benefit areas with relatively
sparse distribution of industry, or low density industry areas that do not lend themselves to large extension centers
as a method of service delivery.


Program Implementation Projects Evaluation Criteria


Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive
review panel. Each proposal should address all six evaluation criteria and evaluation criteria 1&hyph;4 will be
weighted more heavily than criteria 5&hyph;6. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic
distribution.
1. 

Target Population (20 points): 

Potential applicants will be required to identify a population of beneficiary companies (the target population)
and their technology-related assistance needs in the proposed service area. Factors that will be considered include:
(a) A clear definition of the target population, its size and demographic characteristics.
(b) Demonstrated understanding of the target population's assistance needs, e.g. technology, training, information,
quality improvement, management, etc.
(c) Appropriateness of the size of the target population and the anticipated impact for the proposed expenditure.
2. 

Delivery Mechanisms (20 points): 

Applicants will need to specify the mechanism for delivery of services to the population of beneficiary companies
(the target population). Factors that will be considered include:
(a) Appropriateness and effectiveness of proposed delivery mechanism for meeting the identified needs of the target
population.
(b) Demonstration of capacity to form effective linkages and partnerships with other appropriate service providers.
(c) Technical quality of the proposed approach, including knowledge and use of best industrial modernization practices.
3. 

Coordination with Existing Resources (20 points): 

Applicants will need to describe how they will coordinate with existing or newly formed state or local technology/industrial
assistance services, and federal services, to allow for increased economies of scale and to avoid duplication of

Regional Linkages Projects



Project Objective



The purpose of Regional Linkage projects is to support inter-state or multi-state partnerships that will expand
the scope and enhance the effectiveness of technical assistance services regionally available to small and medium-sized
manufacturers. Projects may be assistance service-led, or industry-led partnerships to provide assistance services
that cross institutional and political boundaries. Assistance service-led partnerships, for example, can include
shared assistance services that cross state boundaries, or electronic networking. Industry-led partnerships
can include linkage activities between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers, creating a multi-state
network of suppliers, program planning for multi-state assistance delivery, or other activities that improve the
interactions between manufacturers.



Regional Projects Evaluation Criteria



Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive
review panel. Each proposal should address all six evaluation criteria and evaluation criteria 1&hyph;4 will be
weighted more heavily than criteria 5&hyph;6. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic
distribution.

1. 

Target Population (20 points): 

Potential applicants will be required to identify a population of beneficiary companies (the target population)
and their technology-related assistance needs in the proposed service area. Factors that will be considered include:

(a) A clear definition of the target population, its size and demographic characteristics.

(b) Demonstrated understanding of the target population's assistance needs, eg. technology, training, information,
quality improvement, management, etc.
