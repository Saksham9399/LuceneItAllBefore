The RTDG program is authorized by Section 310B (f) through (h) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7
U.S.C. 1932). The RTDG program will improve the economic conditions in rural areas by promoting development and commercialization
of new services, products, processes, and enterprises. Grants may be used to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of the project
and administrative costs; the applicant must contribute at least 25 percent. RTDG grants are competitive and shall
be awarded to nonprofit institutions and public bodies based on specific selection criteria, as required by legislation
and set out in 7 CFR Part 4284&hyph;F. Project selection will be given to those projects that contribute the most to
the improvement of economic conditions in rural areas. Preferences will be given to those projects that will create
industries or agribusinesses, increase employment, stem the flow of outmigration, and increase the tax base in the
areas to be served. Applicants must provide data to support these criteria. The information submitted should provide
an accurate picture of the economic conditions of the rural areas to be served. The Agency will use the information
collected to select the best projects for funding. The interim rule published elsewhere in today's

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

1995 Census Test &hyph; Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) Independent Listing.


Form Number(s): 

DG&hyph;1302, DG&hyph;1314, DG&hyph;31.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

750 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

30,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

1.5 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

Prompted by the need to improve estimation techniques during the decennial census, the Census Bureau has developed
the Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) approach. This approach will be tested in the 1995 Census Test. The ICM
test will utilize a separately sampled group of blocks within the test sites which will be independently listed before
the census test is conducted. The results of the independent listing will be compared to the housing unit list resulting
from the census test in a 3&hyph;step process: first, computer matching, next, clerical matching, and finally, a
reinterview to reconcile differences between the two lists. This reconciliation will identify both housing units
missed and those erroneously included in the census test. This request is for OMB clearance of the listing phase of
the ICM test. The remainder of the ICM approach&hyph;&hyph;the reinterview phase&hyph;&hyph;will be submitted
to OMB separately. The ICM approach supports one of the 1995 Census Test objectives&hyph;&hyph;to use sampling and
statistical estimation to reduce the differential undercount and census costs. Results of this test of the ICM approach
will be applied to the Year 2000 Decennial Census.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

One time only.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Mandatory.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.

 The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on fireplace mesh

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background 



On June 1, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 28336) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on fireplace mesh panels from Taiwan (June 7,
1982).

Additionally, as required by 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent
to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested
parties who might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the
last day of the anniversary month. 



Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of fireplace mesh panels from Taiwan. This merchandise is currently
classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 7314.49.00 and 7323.99.00. The HTS numbers are
provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 

In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on fireplace mesh
panels from Taiwan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping
duty order in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii). 


This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of fireplace mesh panels from Taiwan entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption on or after June 1, 1994. Entries made during the period June 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994,
will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.22(e). The Department will instruct
the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after June 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated
antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d).

Scope of Order


The product covered by this order is grain-oriented silicon electrical steel (GOES), which is a flat-rolled alloy
steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than
1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another
alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.56 millimeters, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are
of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, as currently classifiable in the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

 (HTSUS) under item numbers 7225.10.0030, 7226.10.1030, 7226.10.5015 and 7226.10.5065. Although the HTSUS subheadings
are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.



Antidumping Duty Order 


On August 8, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified
the Department that imports of GOES from Italy materially injure a U.S. industry. Therefore, in accordance with section
736 of the Act, the Department will direct United States Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering
authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market
value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of GOES from Italy. These antidumping duties
will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of GOES from Italy entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption
on or after February 9, 1994, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the


Federal Register

 (59 FR 5991). 
On or after the date of publication of this notice in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On May 4, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23051) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping on spun acrylic yarn from Italy (April 8, 1980). 

Additionally, as required by 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent
to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested
parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. 


Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of spun acrylic yarn from Italy. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 5509.32.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the order is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 

In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic
yarn from Italy is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping
duty order in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii). 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of spun acrylic yarn from Italy entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after April 1, 1994. Entries made during the period April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994, will
be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs
Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after April 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping
duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 6, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R.
23700) of proposed addition to the Procurement List.



Comments were received from the current contractor in response to a request for sales data. The commenter indicated
that its flexible disk contract with the Government represented a substantial part of the its total sales. As a result
of this comment, the portion of the Government requirement for this flexible disk planned to be added to the Procurement
List was reduced to avoid having a severe adverse impact on the contractor. After the comment period announced in the
notice of proposed rulemaking closed, the contractor requested an extension of the comment period to file an objection
to the Committee's proposal. An extension was granted to the contractor, but no comments were received during the
extended comment period.

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee
has determined that the commodity listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C.
46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were:

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity to the Government.

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodity.

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodity to the Government.

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for addition to the Procurement List.

Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the Procurement List:






Disk, Flexible

7045&hyph;01&hyph;283&hyph;4362

(15% of the Government's requirement)






This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised
under those contracts.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Lowry Air Force Base (AFB), CO</DOCTITLE>



On August 1, 1994, the Air Force signed the ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Lowry AFB. The decisions included in this
ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental Impact
Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on July 1, 1994.

Lowry AFB will close on September 30, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and
Realignment Act (BCRA) (Public Law 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on
Base Realignment and Closure. This ROD documents the Lowry AFB disposal decisions.

The decision conveyed by the ROD is to dispose of Lowry AFB in a manner that enables development of a business and training
center, an education complex, and residential areas. This allowed for the central theme of the proposed future land
use plans discussed in the FEIS to be fully implemented. The environmental findings and mitigation measures contained
in the initial ROD remain fully applicable.

Consistent with the community reuse plan, the ROD balances institutional (educational), residential, and public
facilities/recreation land uses throughout the base, including commercial office and retail activities, research/education/training
centers, light industrial business park, and multiple family housing.

Several disposal methods and parcels are involved in the ROD including public benefit conveyances to the Department
of Education, Department of Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Of the 1,866 acres, the Lowry Economic Redevelopment Authority will gain more than 700 acres in an economic development
conveyance. Another 576 acres, which includes the golf course, will be offered to the LERA through negotiated sale.
Homeless interests are still being negotiated with the city and county of Denver. The Air Force will retain certain
areas for the Defense Finance Accounting Service and the Air Force Space Command. Electrical, natural gas systems,
and the telephone system will be available through negotiated sale or public sale.

The road network is an integral part of all parcels. Primary roads may be conveyed by negotiated sale to an eligible
public body. Secondary roadways that fall within a parcel completely will be included as part of the parcel. The utility
systems are totally integrated systems, prohibiting their separation among the various parcels. Therefore, disposal
of the utility systems will include conditions under which the recipients must provide service to all parcels. Utility
easements will be granted as appropriate. The gas and electric systems with appropriate easements for maintenance
and repair will be conveyed through negotiated sale to utility purveyors, or eligible public bodies. Water and wastewater
are required to support redevelopment efforts and is contingent on the recipient continuing to provide the necessary
service to all parcels. Water and wastewater systems will be assigned to Health and Human Services (HHS) contingent
upon formal request for conveyance for use in the protection of public health.

The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statues and regulations,
and all reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment.

Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Ms. Teresa R. Pohlman, Program Manager, Central Division.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/CE, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809.

4. Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company



[Docket No. ER94&hyph;1501&hyph;000] 



Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company (Delmarva) of Wilmington, Delaware, filed under
the provisions of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act a twenty-year power supply contract (the Service Agreement)
under which Delmarva will provide all requirements service to the Town of Smyrna, Delmarva (Smyrna). Delmarva states
that the Service Agreement supersedes Delmarva's Rate Schedule No. 68 under which Smyrna currently receives service.


Delmarva, with Smyrna's concurrence, requests an effective date of June 30, 1994, for the new Service Agreement.
This effective date is specified by the terms of the Service Agreement. 

The Service Agreement provides for the continuation of the requirements service previously furnished Smyrna under
Rate Schedule No. 68, but changes certain terms and conditions. The chief differences between the Service Agreement
an Rate Schedule No. 68 are the Service Agreement provides for all requirements service as a change from the partial
requirements service Smyrna was receiving, establishes a new rate for Smyrna which is below the level of the rate currently
charged Smyrna and below the settlement rate previously established for Smyrna in Docket No. ER82&hyph;236&hyph;000,
and provides for future adjustments to the Smyrna rate based on changes in the level of Delmarva's retail rates. The
Service Agreement has a twenty year term. 

Delmarva states that the filing has been posed and has been served upon the affected customer and the Delaware Public
Service Commission.

two proposed decreases in its FPC Electric Service Tariffs Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 to the Pennsylvania boroughs (Boroughs)
of New Wilmington, Wampum, Zelienople, Ellwood City and Grove City, respectively. The first decrease is a reduction
in the State Tax Adjustment Surcharge (``STAS'' or Rider I) from 0.00% to ^0.15% effective July 21, 1994. The second
change is a decrease in the Energy Cost Rate (``ECR'' or Rider II) from $.002767/kWh to $.0022087/kWh effective August
1, 1994. The revenue effect of the first change is to decrease annual revenues from the municipal resale class by approximately
$10,893 or 0.14%. The second change results in an annual decrease of $95,213 or 1.24%. 

The five municipal resale customers served by Penn Power entered into settlement agreements effective as of September

<DOCTITLE>Avoca Natural Gas Storage; Notice of Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Avoca Gas Storage
Field Project</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment
(EA) on the natural gas storage field facilities proposed by Avoca Natural Gas Storage (Avoca) in the above-referenced
docket.

The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Avoca Gas Storage
Field Project. The project involves construction of five solution-minded caverns in a rock salt formation about
4,000 feet below the surface. Up to 3 million gallons per day of fresh water would be used to dissolve the salt, and an
equivalent volume of brine would be produced and disposed of by injecting it into deep geologic formations about 10,000
feet below the surface. The proposed facilities include:



Storage Cavern Facilities



&bull;ten solution-mining/storage cavern wells (2 per cavern);
&bull;1.82 miles of 12-inch-diameter water injection pipeline;
&bull;1.82 miles of 12-inch-diameter brine disposal pipeline;
&bull;1.82 miles of 2-inch-diameter diesel injection pipeline; and
&bull;1.82 miles of 20-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline.



Leach Plant Facilities



&bull;a pump building;
&bull;three 400-horsepower fresh water injection pumps;
&bull;six 600-horsepower brine disposal pumps;
&bull;a brine settling pond;
&bull;storage tanks within concrete containment areas; and
&bull;1.5-miles of electric power service line.



Water Source Facilities



&bull;three large-capacity fresh water source wells;
&bull;eleven aquifer monitoring wells; and
&bull;1.48 miles of 12-inch-diameter water pipeline.



Brine Disposal Facilities


&bull;six brine disposal wells; and
&bull;5.23 miles of 12-inch-diameter brine disposal pipeline.



Gas Injection/Withdrawal Facilities


&bull;0.22 mile of 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline;
&bull;a 25,000-horsepower compressor station;
&bull;gas dehydration facilities; and
&bull;a meter station.

The purpose of the proposed project would be to offer a stand-alone service for storing natural gas which would enhance
the availability of clean-burning natural gas for industrial and utility customers in the Northeastern United States.

Avoca would interconnect the storage field with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's pipeline system. Potential storage
customers could then use this system as the transporter for gas into and out of the Avoca Gas Storage Field.

The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, (202)
208&hyph;1371.

Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
newspapers, and parties to this proceeding.

A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental
Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington,
DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1046.

Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;161&hyph;000
and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE.,
Washington, DC 20426.

Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than September 6, 1994, to ensure consideration
prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental
Project Manager.

Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commenter a party to the proceeding. Any
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214).

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your comments considered.

Additional information about this project is available from Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental review and Compliance
Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208&hyph;1046.

will send a maintenance fee filing form (EPA Form No. 8570&hyph;30 and instructions) to each registrant. The registrants
must complete this form and return it to the Agency. The Agency uses the information to ensure that the fees prescribed
by the recent revisions to FIFRA have been paid by each registrant. These data are also used to ensure proper adjustment
to the Agency's computer files. The files are updated to reflect changes in the status of registrations resulting
from registrants responses.

Burden Statement: The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average less than one hour per response.
This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data needed, complete the form and review
the collection of information.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given in accordance with the provision of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300f 

et seq., 

and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Illinois
is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA) has adopted drinking water regulations for Lead and Copper, 44 synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs),
12 inorganic chemicals (IOCs), and 8 volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that correspond to the NPDWR for Lead and Copper,
SOCs, IOCs, and VOCs, and promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460&hyph;26564),
on January 30, 1991 (56 FR 3526&hyph;3597), as amended on July 1, 1991 (56 FR 30266&hyph;30281), and on July 17, 1992
(57 FR 31776&hyph;31849). The USEPA has completed its review of Illinois' PWSS primacy program revision and has determined
that these sets of state program revisions are not less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations.



The USEPA has determined that the Illinois rule revisions meet the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore, the
USEPA has determined that these sets of state program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal
regulations and is proposing to approve the IEPA's rule revisions.

All interested parties are invited to submit written comments on these proposed determinations, and may request
a public hearing on or before September 12, 1994. If a public hearing is requested and granted, the corresponding determination
shall not become effective until such time following the hearing, at which the Regional Administrator issues an order
affirming or rescinding this action. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional
Administrator.

Requests for public hearing should be addressed to: Rosemarie Karas, (WD&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual,
organization, or other entity requesting a hearing. (2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in
the Regional Administrator's determinations and of information that the requesting person intends to submit at
such hearing. (3) The signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization
or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity.

Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such
notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Illinois. A notice will be sent to the person(s) requesting
the hearing as well as to the State of Illinois. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information
regarding the time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further
information. The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review
of the hearing record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order.

Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and should the Regional Administrator not elect
to hold a hearing on his own motion, these determinations shall become effective on September 12, 1994. Please bring
this notice to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in these determinations.

All documents related to these determinations are available for inspection between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, at the following offices:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On May 18, 1993, Administrator Carol Browner announced an initiative to further the protection of human health and
the environment_referred to as the Hazardous Waste Minimization and Combustion Draft Strategy (``Draft Strategy'').
The Draft Strategy was designed, among other things, to further the reduction in the quantity and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated in the United States as well as to strengthen federal controls governing hazardous waste combustion.
Since the announcement of the Draft Strategy, the Agency has held extensive discussions with all the interested stakeholders,
including a series of Roundtable discussions. Based on these discussions, EPA developed and released on May 24, 1994,
a Draft Plan to implement the waste minimization part of the Draft Strategy. 

The Draft Plan describes two phases: the first phase focuses on hazardous wastes containing metals and/or halogenated
organics burned in combustion units. The second phase will move beyond metal- and halogen-containing wastes managed
in combustion devices and will address source reduction and recycling opportunities for the broader universe of
hazardous wastes managed by a variety of practices. 

Key components of the Draft Plan include: establishing specific goals for source reduction and recycling; prioritizing
wastestreams and industrial processes for source reduction and recycling; identifying and evaluating source reduction
and recycling opportunities for these wastestreams and industrial processes; arraying potential voluntary and
regulatory mechanisms for effecting source reduction and recycling; and measuring progress. 

One of the building blocks for the Draft Plan is setting priorities for source reduction and recycling. EPA has developed
and is today releasing the Draft Methodology Document, which describes a proposed hazard-based methodology for
ranking hazardous wastestreams and, in turn, ranking the industrial processes that generate them. The document
also presents draft ranking results for certain wastestreams and industrial processes. 

EPA is soliciting comments from reviewers on a number of specific issues presented in the Draft Methodology Document.
Some of these issues are summarized below. 


_

Criteria relevant to developing a prioritization methodology. 

There are a number of criteria which could potentially be considered in setting priorities for waste minimization.
Some potential risk- or hazard-based criteria include: 



&bull;Waste quantities 
&bull;Waste characteristics (e.g., constituent concentrations and physical/chemical properties) 
&bull;Waste management practices (e.g., combustion) 
&bull;Constituent releases 
&bull;Fate and transport 
&bull;Human and ecological exposure 
&bull;Human and ecological toxicity 
Other possible criteria include: 
&bull;Protection of natural resources (e.g., stratospheric ozone and ground water) 
&bull;Demand for waste management capacity 
&bull;Environmental justice concerns 
&bull;Technical/economic feasibility of promoting waste minimization 

The Agency is soliciting comments on which criteria (among those listed above or others not listed above) should be
emphasized in setting priorities for minimization of hazardous wastes.

_

Sources of waste characterization data. 

While the Agency has collected waste characterization data as part of hazardous waste listing determinations and
industry surveys, most of these data have limitations (e.g., the data are often more than five years old). Some of the
more important and challenging data elements for prioritizing hazardous wastes (and, in turn, industrial processes)
based on hazard are: (1) the identities of constituents (i.e., chemicals) present in wastestreams, and (2) the concentrations
of the constituents. Therefore, the Agency solicits comment on whether there are other readily-available sources
of waste characterization data, in addition to the data already obtained by EPA, that include these data elements
and that could potentially be employed for ranking these wastestreams (e.g., data collected by state regulatory
agencies or technical assistance centers). 

_

Emphasis on hazard of wastes as generated. 

Consistent with the goal of the Draft Plan to reduce the quantity and toxicity of hazardous wastes, EPA's draft methodology
prioritizes wastestreams based on the hazard associated with those wastes as generated. In effect, it identifies
and promotes source reduction for the most pervasive, toxic, mobile, persistent, and/or bioaccumulative wastes,
based on the characteristics of the wastes prior to management. At present, the draft methodology does not directly
consider the hazard associated with the wastes 

as managed 

(e.g., considering releases and exposures following combustion of the wastes). EPA requests comment on the appropriateness
of emphasizing the hazard of wastes 

as generated 

in developing a national-level screening methodology for prioritizing hazardous wastes. 

_

Applicability of EPA's as-generated hazard-based methodology to combusted wastestreams containing metals and/or
halogenated organics. 

Given that metals are not destroyed by combustion (and typically exit the combustion unit in ash, air releases, or
product), EPA is soliciting comments on whether EPA's draft as-generated hazard-based methodology is appropriate
for national screening of wastestreams containing metals. EPA is also seeking comments on whether the draft methodology
is appropriate for wastestreams containing halogenated organics, or whether the draft methodology should be modified
to better reflect the hazard of these compounds as managed (e.g., through applying a destruction and removal efficiency
(DRE) factor to halogen concentrations in wastes, prioritizing based on the percent halogen in waste feedstocks,
focusing on wastestreams containing dioxin precursors, or using another approach). EPA would also be interested
in commenters' views on whether the draft methodology should be complemented by considering releases/transfers
reported in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).

<DOCTITLE>Notice Regarding Revisions to Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting Forms under Section 313 of the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice informs the public that the annual deadline for EPA's receipt of voluntary revisions to Toxic Chemical
Release Inventory Forms (Form R or report) is changed to October 15th each year. The new deadline is 6 weeks earlier
than the November 30th deadline set in an earlier notice. Voluntary revisions must now be received from facilities
on or before October 15th, in order for the revisions to be included in the next annual release of the Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI). TRI was established pursuant to section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA),
42 U.S.C. 11001, 11023, also known as the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 or Title III. This notice
amends an earlier notice regarding revisions which is still in effect except for the change in the revisions deadline.




</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 This notice is effective beginning October 15, 1994, and continuing in each year thereafter. 



</DATE>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Information Hotline, Environmental Protection Agency, Mail Stop
5101, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Toll free: 800&hyph;535&hyph;0202. 



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice informs the public of EPA's administering of the data management aspects of the TRI program. This notice
amends an EPA notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48795), titled ``Notice Regarding Revisions to Toxic Release Inventory Reporting Forms
under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986'' hereinafter referred to as
the ``September 1991 Notice.'' 


The September 1991 Notice, among other things, set November 30th as the deadline for EPA's receipt of voluntary revisions
that could be processed in time to be included in the next annual release of TRI. The September 1991 Notice is still in
effect except that the deadline for receipt of voluntary revisions is now October 15th each year instead of November
30th. Revisions received after October 15th will continue to be processed; however, EPA will not guarantee that they
will be included in the next annual release of TRI. The new revision deadline reflects EPA's ability to process and
release TRI data earlier due to increased efficiencies in data entry that have been accomplished since the September
1991 Notice was published.

<RINDOCK>[Fact Finding Investigation No. 22]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>Possible Rate Malpractices in Specified United States_Foreign Trade; Order </DOCTITLE>




The Federal Maritime Commission has reason to believe that persons participating in the trades between ports and
points in the United States and ports and points in Europe, the Far East, South America, Central America or the Caribbean
(``the specified Trades'') may have obtained, or attempted to obtain, transportation of property by water at less
or different compensation than the rates and charges shown in applicable tariffs or service contracts. The various
unfair devices or means which may have been used include rebates, concessions, absorptions and allowances other
than those set forth in applicable tariffs, misdeclarations and other similar practices, in violation of the prohibitions
of section 10(a)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(a)(1). 

The Commission also has reason to believe that common carriers operating in the United States foreign commerce in
the specified Trades, directly or indirectly, may have provided, or allowed other persons to obtain transportation
of property at less or different compensation than the rates and charges shown in applicable tariffs or service contracts.
These actions may have been accomplished by failure to file a common carrier tariff and by various unfair devices or
means, such as rebates, concessions, absorptions and allowances other than those set forth in applicable tariffs
and through misdeclarations and other similar practices, in violation of the prohibitions of sections 8 and 10(b)
of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707 and 1709(b). 

If established, such violations are subject to civil penalties not to exceed $25,000 for each violation willfully
and knowingly committed, pursuant to section 13(a) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(a). Additionally, carriers
who rebate or commit other rate malpractices in contravention of their tariffs or service contracts may have their
tariffs or their participation in conference tariffs suspended by the Commission pursuant to section 13(b)(1) of
the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(b)(1). 

In order to ensure the proper and effective administration and enforcement of the shipping statutes, the Commission
is instituting a nonadjudicatory investigation to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant informal
compromise procedures or formal investigation and assessment proceedings for violations of the 1984 Act with regard
to the transportation of property in the specified Trades. 

The Commission presently has in effect Fact Finding Investigation No. 16, 

Possible Malpractices in the Trans-Atlantic Trades 

(``FFI No. 16''), and Fact Finding Investigation No. 18, 

Rebates and Other Malpractices in the Trans-Pacific Trades 

(``FFI No. 18''). Because the purpose and scope of FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 are included within the nonadjudicatory
fact finding investigation instituted by this Order, FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 will be terminated by separate Orders
at such time as final reports are submitted by the Investigative Officers and accepted by the Commission. Any outstanding
subpoenas or investigative activities of FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 remain in force and are incorporated in this newly
instituted fact finding investigation. 

Therefore, it is ordered, That pursuant to sections 8, 10, 11 and 12 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707,
1709, 1710 and 1711, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46 CFR 502.281, et seq., a
nonadjudicatory investigation is hereby instituted into the practices of common carriers and other persons with
respect to untariffed transportation activity and the possible payment of rebates and any other devices or means
of providing, or allowing persons to obtain, transportation of property at less or different compensation than the
rates and charges shown in applicable tariffs or service contacts, in the trades between United States ports and points
and ports and points in Europe, the Far East, South America, Central America or the Caribbean; 

It is further ordered, That the Investigative Officers shall be Wm. Jarrel Smith, Jr., Vern W. Hill, Peter J. King,
Charles L. Haslup, III, and Joseph B. Slunt of the Commission. The Investigative Officers shall be assisted by staff
members as may be assigned by the Commission's Managing Director and shall have full authority to hold public or non-public
sessions, to resort to all compulsory process authorized by law (including the issuance of subpoenas ad testificandum
and duces tecum), to administer oaths and to perform such other duties as may be necessary in accordance with the laws
of the United States and the regulations of the Commission; 

It is further ordered, That the Investigative Officers shall issue a joint report of activities, findings and recommendations
no later than one year after publication of this Order in the Federal Register, and at least yearly thereafter, such
reports to remain confidential unless and until the Commission rules otherwise; 

It is further ordered, That at such time as FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 are terminated by Order of the Commission, any subpoena
or investigative activity in FFI No. 16 and FFI No. 18 outstanding at the time of termination shall be continued in force
and is incorporated herein; 

It is further ordered, That this proceeding will remain in effect until discontinued by further Order of the Commission;
and 

It is further ordered, That notice of this Order be published in the 

Federal Register

.

Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission

Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 

Federal Register.


The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger

<ACTION>

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

For further information, contact David Pollack, room 7262, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh
Street SW, Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708&hyph;4300; TDD number for the hearing- and speech-impaired

</ADDRESS>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless

 v. 

Veterans Administration

, No. 88&hyph;2503&hyph;OG (D.D.C.).



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A&hyph;10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll-free information line at 1&hyph;800&hyph;927&hyph;7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to David
Pollack at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number

i.e.

NOFA for the Rental Voucher Set-Aside for Homeless Persons With Disabilities for FY 94; Amendment 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of fund availability for FY 1994; Amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department published a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) on February 1, 1994, that announced the availability
of a set-aside of rental voucher funds of up to $147.7 million for very low-income homeless persons with disabilities
and their families in a regional competition. The deadline date for applications was May 2, 1994 at the HUD State or
Area Office. The Department received a large number of applications in response to the NOFA and began the review and
ratings process. During the review process, HUD determined that many housing agencies (HAs) did not submit a request
for a specific amount of Section 8 budget authority in addition to a request for the number of units, shown in the Form
HUD&hyph;52515. The lack of a budget authority request, or, in the case of some HAs, an inadequate budget authority
request based on the number of units listed in the Form HUD&hyph;52515, led to circumstances in which the certification
in Attachment 7A of the NOFA was either rendered meaningless (in the absence of a budget authority request) or the application
was rendered unacceptable, since the dollar-for-dollar match requirement was not met. Based upon the information
originally submitted by the HAs by the May 2, 1994, deadline, HUD determined that a large number of applications would
be rejected.



The Department has decided through this amendment to the February 1, 1994, NOFA to allow HAs to submit an initial or
revised request for Section 8 budget authority. This request must equal the amount of Section 8 budget authority necessary
to fund the number of units requested in the Form HUD&hyph;52515. The HA may request that the HUD Office calculate this
amount for the HA if the HA provides to HUD the number of units by bedroom size and the average monthly adjusted income.
It will also be used as the amount of supportive services commitments to which the HA, or other entity, commits itself
in the Attachment 7A certification. If the new request for Section 8 budget authority does not match the amount of budget
authority needed to fund the full request for units, as shown in the Form HUD&hyph;52515, the application will be rejected.
HAs should be aware that the new request for Section 8 budget authority may affect the value of the supportive services
certified by the HA in Attachment 7A of the NOFA. HAs should also be aware that the first year firm financial commitments
may not be modified although the change in the request for Section 8 budget authority may affect the score received
under Selection Criterion 5: Documentation of First Year Supportive Services. HAs will not be allowed to revise any
other aspect of their applications and any other information submitted by HAs under this amendment will not be accepted.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This block management area (BMA) includes 92,810 acres. Public land is administered by the BLM, Judith Resource Area,
Lewistown District. This designation is the result of a cooperative effort among private landowners, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Montana Department of State Lands and the BLM.
The purpose of this designation is to prevent damage to soil, vegetation and scenic resources, to open additional
private and state lands for hunting and to reduce landowner/recreationist conflicts so as to provide a higher quality
hunt. 



The off-road vehicle limitation area is located in northern Petroleum County, Montana. It includes all public lands
administered by the BLM north of the Crooked Creek and Dunn Ridge roads. 

Hunting within the described block will be subject to the following rules. 

1. All off-road vehicle travel is prohibited. 

2. All roads not shown on this map or signed as open, are closed to motorized vehicle use with the exclusive exception
of retrieving downed big game. Big game retrieval is allowed between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily on open or closed roads.
Prior to or after these hours, motorized vehicles are not permitted on closed roads or off roads. No off-road vehicle
use will be allowed on any lands within this BMA. 

3. All public land in this management area is open to walk in hunting. 

4. The private land in this management area is open to walk in hunting, except around residential areas, shipping pastures
and portions of the Weingart, Iverson, Sikveland and Square Butte Grazing Association Ranches (these are individually
signed at reasonable access and boundary points). 

5. Camping on private land requires landowner permission. 

6. Camping is permitted on public land (14-day stay limit) within 100 yards of open roads. Direct access by motor vehicle
is permitted to and from campsites using the most direct route to avoid damage to soils and vegetation. Such camping
is also allowed within a reasonable distance down closed roads, after obtaining a special use permit issued by the
Judith Resource Area. 

7. Use of state land is governed by the Department of State Land (DSL) regulations. There are four major areas where
these rules differ from those used in the rest of this BMA. These include: (1) A DSL recreational use license is required
for general recreational use; (2) Camping is allowed within 200 feet of an open road and is limited to two days only;
(3) No open fires or fireworks are allowed; and (4) Horses cannot be kept on state lands overnight. 

8. Outfitters and other recreationists must use certified weed free hay on BLM and DSL land for their livestock.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the Shenandoah
salamander (

Plethodon shenandoah

). The Shenandoah salamander is limited to mountain slopes within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park in Page
and Madison Counties, Virginia. It was listed as endangered in 1989 due to competition with the redbacked salamander
(

Plethodon cinereus

) and eventual succession of the Shenandoah salamander's talus-slope habitat to conditions favoring the redbacked
salamander. Human-related factors potentially affecting the Shenandoah salamander include potentially adverse
physiological and/or reproductive effects associated with acid deposition, and defoliation of trees associated
with non-native insect outbreaks. The primary recovery strategy for this species is to minimize any human-related
impacts on the Shenandoah salamander while monitoring the effects of natural competition. The Service solicits
review and comment from the public on this draft Plan.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments on the draft Recovery Plan must be received September 12, 1994 to receive consideration by the Service.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Persons wishing to review the draft Recovery Plan can obtain a copy from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region
Five, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadlley, Massachusetts 01035&hyph;9589, telephone (413) 253&hyph;8628. Comments

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, established criteria
for the recovery level for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.

The document submitted for review is the draft Shenandoah Salamander (

Plethodon shenandoah

) Recovery Plan. This small woodland salamander is known only from the northeast to northwest-facing talus slopes
of three mountains_Hawksbill, The Pinnacles, and Stony Man_all within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park
in Page and Madison Counties, Virginia.

The effects of fires, farming, and timbering operations prior to 1936 (when the Park was established) on the current
limited distribution of the Shenandoah salamander are unknown. In its present environment, however, the primary
threats to the salamander appear to be competition with the aggressive and successful red-backed salamander (which
confines the Shenandoah salamander to a few relatively dry talus areas not occupied by the competitor), and eventual
succession of these talus areas to moister habitat more suitable for the red-backed salamander. The red-backed salamander
is widely distributed and completely surrounds each of the three isolates of the Shenandoah salamander.

Against this backdrop of naturally occurring threats to the salamander's continued existence, two major, relatively
recent anthropogenic factors appear to have the potential of further endangering this species as well as threatening
other faunal and floral components of the ecosystem it inhabits. These include: (1) defoliation of trees within its
habitat, associated with outbreaks of gypsy moths, hemlock woolly adelgids, or other introduced forest pest species;
and (2) further debilitation of overstory vegetation, changes in soil chemistry, and direct impacts to the salamanders
associated with acid deposition and other sources of air pollution.

Because the Shenandoah salamander represents an unusual case in which natural factors play a major role in its present
endangerment, the recovery objective is to stabilize this species. Recovery activities will focus on minimizing
human impacts on the Shenandoah salamander and conducting long-term monitoring to detect any significant changes
in size or demographic structure of Shenandoah salamander populations as well as any shifts in distribution between
this species and the red-backed salamander. Studies to examine impacts of acid deposition, forest defoliators,
and control agents will be conducted if it is determined that Shenandoah salamander habitat is susceptible to defoliation.
All Park maintenance and management activities will be conducted in a way that is compatible with Shenandoah salamander
populations.

The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the Plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments to
abandon its line of railroad, known as the Lake Alfred Branch, between milepost AW&hyph;836.0 and milepost AW&hyph;839.5,
a distance of approximately 3.5 miles, in Polk County, FL.

CSXT has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or

at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter),
49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met.


As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under
Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately
protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on September 11, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by
August 17, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;33] </RINDOCK>


Phillip L. Brown, D.D.S.; Revocation of Registration 


On July 23, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Phillip L. Brown, D.D.S. (Respondent) of Aurora, Colorado. The Order to Show
Cause sought to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AB2731998, and to deny any pending applications
for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would
be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Specifically, the Order to Show Cause
alleged that Respondent administered lethal doses of Demerol, a Schedule II controlled substance, and Valium, a
Schedule IV controlled substance, while attempting to sedate a patient; and as a result of such action, Respondent
pled guilty to and was convicted of one count of manslaughter in the State of Colorado and voluntarily surrendered
his dental license to the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners (Board), effective August 19, 1992. 
Respondent, acting on his own behalf, filed a timely request for a hearing. The matter was docketed before Administrative
Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Thereafter, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition alleging that Respondent
no longer had state authority to handle controlled substances. Respondent did not file a response to this motion.

On May 17, 1994, the administrative law judge issued an order stating that the motion for summary disposition was warranted
as there was no question of material fact involved. Furthermore, he explained that the DEA lacks statutory authority
to register a practitioner unless the practitioner currently has state authority to handle controlled substances
and concluded that Respondent is without authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Colorado. Consequently,
the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's
DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. No exceptions were filed and on June 17, 1994, the entire record of these
proceedings was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator. 
After a careful review of the record in this matter, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's
recommendation. DEA does not have the authority under the Controlled Substances Act to grant a registration to a practitioner
if that practitioner is not authorized by a state to handle controlled substances. 

See Ramon Pla, M.D.,

 Docket No. 86&hyph;54, 51 FR 41168 (1986); 

George S. Heath, M.D.,

 Docket No. 86&hyph;24, 51 FR 26610 (1986); 

Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S.,

 Docket No. 85&hyph;57, 51 FR 23481 (1986). There is no evidence in the record to contradict the Government's position
that Respondent's Colorado dental license has been revoked pursuant to Respondent's surrender of his dental license
and that his authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Colorado has been nullified. Consequently,
revocation of Respondent's DEA registration is warranted. 
The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's granting of the Government's motion for summary
disposition. In the absence of a question of material fact, a plenary adversary administrative proceeding is not
required. 

See United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Company, Ltd.,

Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D.,

 Docket No. 77&hyph;29, 43 FR 11873 (1978). 
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AB2731998, previously issued to Phillip L. Brown, D.D.S., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications
for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 12, 1994.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;76]</RINDOCK>



<DOCTITLE>Diana J. Smith, M.D., Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On August 9, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Diana J. Smith, M.D. (Respondent). The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Respondent's
DEA Certificate of Registration, AS2966919, issued to her in Arizona and to deny any pending applications for renewal
of such registration. The Order to Show cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
Respondent filed a timely request for a hearing. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen
Bittner. Before the hearing could be scheduled, the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners (Board) entered into a consent
decree with Respondent, in which Respondent voluntarily relinquished her license to practice medicine in the State
of Arizona, effective October 14, 1993. The Government then filed a motion for summary disposition based upon the
Board's order, alleging that since Respondent was not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the
State of Arizona, DEA could not continue to register Respondent in that state. Respondent filed a response to this
motion, arguing that her DEA registration should not be revoked because she still had current medical licenses in
two other states, Virginia and North Carolina, and was applying for medical licensure in the State of Washington where
she currently resides.
On April 18, 1994, the administrative law judge issued her opinion and recommended decision. The administrative
law judge stated that the motion for summary disposition was warranted as there was no question of material fact involved.
Furthermore, she explained in her opinion that the only relevant medical license was the one that Respondent formerly
held in Arizona, since Respondent's DEA registration was issued to her in that state. The administrative law judge
then noted that the DEA lacks statutory power to register a practitioner unless the practitioner holds state authority
to handle controlled substances and concluded that Respondent is without authority to handle controlled substances
in the State of Arizona. Consequently, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary
disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. No exceptions were filed
and on May 23, 1994, the entire record of these proceedings was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator.
After a careful review of the record in this matter, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's
opinion and recommended decision. As DEA has consistently held, the DEA does not have the authority under the Controlled
Substances Act to grant a registration to a practitioner if that practitioner is not authorized by a state to handle
controlled substances. 

See Ramon Pla, M.D., 

Docket No. 86&hyph;54, 51 FR 41168 (1986); 

George S. Heath, M.D. 

Docket No. 86&hyph;24, 51 FR 26610 (1986); 

Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., 

Docket No. 85&hyph;57, 51 FR 23481 (1986). There is no evidence in the record to contradict the Government's position
that Respondent's Arizona medical license has been revoked and that her authority to handle controlled substances
in the State of Arizona has been nullified. Furthermore, Respondent has not requested modification of her DEA registration
to one of the two states where she currently holds medical licenses. Consequently, revocation of Respondent's DEA
registration is warranted.
The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's granting of the Government's motion for summary
disposition. In the absence of a question of material fact, a plenary adversary administrative proceeding is not
required. 

See United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Company, Ltd., 

445 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971); 

N.L.R.B. v. International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL&hyph;CIO,

Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D., 

Docket No. 77&hyph;29, 43 FR 11873 (1978).
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
AS2966919, previously issued to Diana J. Smith, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications
for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 12, 1994.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basis hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determination in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 19 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S&hyph;3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

 Notice of policy decision.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In light of the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to update the &sect;76.51
major television market list, the Copyright Office is reaffirming its 1987 Policy Decision accepting Commission
market redesignation for purposes of the copyright cable compulsory license. Broadcast signals entitled to mandatory
carriage status under the FCC's must-carry rules in effect on April 15, 1976, as a result of a Commission market redesignation
order, are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license. The Copyright Office declines
to take a position at this time as to the possible copyright effect of a future FCC reranking of major television markets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On June 28, 1993, the Copyright Office issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) informing the public that it was considering
the impact of the Federal Communications Commission's recent update of its major television market list, 47 CFR 76.51,
on copyright liability under the cable compulsory license, 17 U.S.C. 111. 58 FR 34594 (June 28, 1993). The Commission's
action, 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket 92&hyph;259, 8 FCC Rcd 2965 (1993), was in response to the ``Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992'' (1992 Cable Act) which adds a new section 614(f) to the Communications Act of 1934 requiring
the FCC to ``update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.'' The Commission amended three markets
on the list by adding Chillicothe to the Columbus, Ohio market; New London to the Hartford-New Haven-New Britain-Waterbury,
Connecticut market; and Rome to the Atlanta, Georgia market. 8 FCC Rcd at 2978. The Commission also announced that
a major revision of the major television market list was not necessary at that time, and that any future changes would
be made on a case-by-case basis. 

Id.

 

The NOI fully described the history and copyright significance of the major television market list. 

See 

58 FR at 34594 (June 28, 1993). To summarize briefly, the major television market list contained in &sect;76.51 of
the Commission's rules is a ranking, based on audience size, of the top 100 television markets in the country derived
from Arbitron's 1970 prime time household rankings. Adopted in 1972, the list named the communities comprising each
individual market

1

 and related, 

inter alia, 

to the carriage obligations of cable systems under the former FCC distant signal and must-carry rules. With the elimination
of the distant signal rules in 1981 and, especially, the invalidation of the must-carry rules in the

 resuscitated the major-market list by requiring the Commission to update it.

The 1992 Act restored must-carry requirements, but adopted a different standard (``area of dominant influence''
or ``ADI'') for applying them. The Supreme Court has reviewed the must-carry rules and, while they currently remain
in force, remanded them to the trial court to make factual findings justifying their retention.

F.C.C., 

62 U.S.L.W. 4647 (June 27, 1994). 

</FOOTNOTE>


Section 76.51 has relevance for the section 111 copyright cable compulsory license in two ways. The first is in determining
whether a broadcast signal is local or distant. Compulsory license royalties are determined, for the most part, by
the number of distant signals a cable system carries. When Congress created the cable license in 1976, it defined a
broadcast station as being local to a cable system when the station ``is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted
by a cable system pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission
in effect on April 15, 1976.'' 17 U.S.C. 111(f). This passage is a direct reference to the FCC's 1976 must-carry rules,
in which the major television market list played a significant role. Under those earlier rules, any cable system community
within 35 miles of a market identified in the &sect;76.51 list was subject to mandatory carriage of any broadcast station
licensed to a community within the market. Hence, as provided by section 111 of the Copyright Code, cable systems in
those circumstances may carry stations located within the major market as a ``local'' signal, thereby avoiding the
distant signal cable compulsory license royalty fee.

Aside from the local/distant status of broadcast signals, &sect;76.51 also serves a purpose in determining the applicable
royalty rate for distant signals to be paid by cable systems. The earlier FCC must-carry rules determined when a broadcast
signal was distant, and in turn the Commission's distant signal carriage rules in effect in 1976 determined how many
distant signals a cable operator in a top 100 television market could carry. 47 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;76.61 and 76.63
(1976). Cable systems operating in the top 50 markets listed in &sect;76.51 were generally allowed to carry three
distant signals, while systems in the second 50 markets could generally carry only two. When the distant signal carriage
rules were eliminated in 1981, 

see Malrite T.V. of New York, Inc. 

v. 

FCC, 

652 F.2d 1140 (2d Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied sub. nom., National Football League, Inc. 

v. 

FCC, 

454 U.S. 1143 (1982), the Copyright Royalty Tribunal adjusted the royalty rates under the Copyright Code provision
permitting adjustment ``[i]n the event that the rules and regulations of the [FCC] are amended .&blank;.&blank;.
to permit the carriage of additional television broadcast signals beyond the local service area of such signals.
.&blank;.&blank;.'' 17 U.S.C. 801(b)(2)(B). The result was that cable carriage of formerly non-permitted distant
signals triggered a substantially higher copyright royalty rate (3.75% of gross receipts per signal) than that applicable
to carriage of formerly permitted signals (less than 1% of gross receipts per signal). 

See Adjustment of the Royalty Rates for Cable Systems, 

47 FR 52146 (Nov. 19, 1982). Cable systems in the top fifty &sect;76.51 markets, therefore, can generally carry one
more non-3.75% distant signal than cable systems located in the second 50 markets. 
Except for redesignation of the scope of a particular market, the markets listed in &sect;76.51 and their ranking
have remained unchanged since the section's inception in 1972. In 1985, the FCC amended the list to include Melbourne
and Cocoa, Florida in the Orlando-Daytona Beach, Florida hyphenated market, and added Visalia, Hanford, and Clovis,
California to the Fresno, California market. 

See Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;11 RM 4557, 102 FCC2d 1062 (1985)(Florida); 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;439, FCC&hyph;85&hyph;59 (1985)(California). That action raised some of the same issues
presented in this proceeding, and we asked for public comment concerning the implications of the FCC action on the
copyright cable compulsory license. 

Notice of Inquiry 

in Docket No. RM 85&hyph;2, 50 FR 14725 (Apr. 15, 1985). We asked the public to respond to a series of questions, including:

(1) What is the impact on the copyright law of a change by the FCC in the major television market list; 
(2) Whether the amendment of &sect;76.51 was a rule change requiring an adjustment in the royalty rates; 
(3) How should the 3.75% royalty for distant formerly nonpermitted signals be applied to the changed market; and 
(4) What action, if any, should the Copyright Office take to clarify the issues raised by the FCC changes in the major
television market list.

We received 12 comments from interested parties, including comments from the FCC. The commentators were in unanimous
agreement that the redesignations of the Orlando-Daytona Beach, Florida and Hanford-Clovis, California hyphenated
markets were not changes in the FCC rules in effect on April 15, 1976, and that the Copyright Office should treat signals
in the newly defined markets that were local for communications purposes as local for purposes of computing copyright
royalties as well. 
We issued a policy decision in 1987 accepting the Florida and California market changes for compulsory license purposes.
52 FR 28362 (July 29, 1987). We stated that we were_*&blank;*&blank;* formally adopt[ing] the view that signals entitled
to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market redesignation order
are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license. This position is necessarily based
upon the interpretations that (1) Congress did not intend &sect;76.51 to be frozen to its April 15, 1976 status for
purposes of determining cable systems' local service area and copyright royalty fees; and (2) when the FCC amends
its major television market list in 47 CFR 76.51, there has been no substantive rule change effected so as to impact
calculation of cable copyright royalties.





Id. 

at 28366 (July 29, 1987). 


While we noted that our ``interpretation [was] based on the legislative history of the Copyright Act,'' we underscored
the moot nature of our policy decision by what then appeared to be the end of changes to &sect;76.51: [T]he changes in
the FCC's must-carry-rules following the 

Quincy 

decision have essentially mooted the subject of this Notice. When this inquiry began the Copyright Office had concerns
about enlargement of the class of local signals under the Copyright Act due to the approximately 400 petitions for
market redesignation at that time pending at the FCC. However, it would appear that this policy concern is now eliminated
because under the FCC's amended must-carry rules, the major market list is not determinative of must-carry status,
and it is unlikely that a large number of market redesignations will be effected by the FCC in the future.





Id. 

The above statement proved to be accurate, especially with the elimination of all must-carry obligations later that
year. 

See Century Communications v. FCC, 

835 F.2d 292 (D.C. Cir. 1987), 

cert. denied, 

486 U.S. 1032 (1988). 


II. 1992 Cable Act 


The composition of the major television market list remained intact until the passage of the 1992 Cable Act. The 1992
Cable Act amends the Communications Act of 1934 by, among other things, adding a new section 614 governing the cable
carriage obligations for local commercial television stations, 

i.e.

, new must-carry rules. As noted above, the 1992 must-carry requirements no longer involve the major-market list.
Nevertheless, section 614(f) of the 1992 Act requires that the FCC's regulations adopted to implement the new must-carry
rules ``shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.''
As we noted in our NOI, the instruction of &sect;614(f) may seem somewhat anomalous since the &sect;76.51 major television
market list has nothing to do with the new must-carry obligations of cable systems.

See 

58 FR at 34594 n.1 (June 28, 1993). In compliance with the statutory directive, however, the Federal Communications
Commission on November 19, 1992, published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;259, 7 FCC Rcd
8055 (1992) to consider changes to the &sect;76.51 list. The Commission stated that, while the Cable Act was silent
as to the reason for changes to &sect;76.51, ``it appears that this [congressional] action would primarily affect
copyright liability under the compulsory license.'' 7 FCC Rcd at 8059 (1992). 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Section 76.51 does have relevance for the Commission's non-network territorial exclusivity, network non-duplication
and syndicated exclusivity rules. 47 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;73.658(m), 76.92 and 76.151. 
</FOOTNOTE>


In its final regulation issued in 1993, the Commission confirmed its copyright observation and redesignated three
&sect;76.51 markets: 1) it added Chillocothe to the Columbus, Ohio market; 2) it added New London to the Hartford-New
Haven-New Britain-Waterbury, Connecticut market; and 3) it added Rome to the Atlanta, Georgia market. 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket 92&hyph;259, 8 FCC Rcd 2965 (1993). Nonetheless, the Commission took a conservative approach in updating
&sect;76.51: We do not believe that a major update of the &sect;76.51 market list is necessary on the basis of the record
before us. Wholesale changes in or reranking the markets on the list would have significant implications for copyright
liability and for the Commission's broadcast and cable program exclusivity rules. We are not prepared to make such
changes on the present record.



8 FCC Rcd at 2979 (1993). Future revisions of the major television market list are to be done on a ``case-by-case'' basis
by petition for rulemaking. 

Id.

 


Although the Commission confined its discussion to the redesignation of markets, it neither embraced nor ruled out
the possibility of reordering markets. (``We are not prepared to make such changes on the present record.'') It is
therefore possible that future changes to the &sect;76.51 list may include not only redesignations but also reranking
and deletions and additions to the market list, although probably in limited circumstances.

III. Notice of Inquiry 


In order to determine the copyright implications, if any, of the 1992 Cable Act's instruction to the FCC to update the
major television market list, we published a NOI initiating this proceeding. 58 FR 34594 (June 28, 1993). We requested
direct response to a series of questions: 
(1) The section 111(f) definition of a ``local service area of a primary transmitter'' is ``the area in which such station
is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to the rules, regulations, and
authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976''_

i.e.

, the 1976 must-carry rules. Is the amendment to the &sect;76.51 major television market list required by the 1992
Cable Act an amendment of the 1976 rules, or is it a separate and independent action of Congress? If it is an independent
act with no bearing on the 1976 rules, under what statutory justification should the Copyright Office follow the present
and future changes to the &sect;76.51 list? 
(2) The FCC has stated its belief that ``Congress intended for our updated &sect;76.51 list to be applied to assess
copyright liability.'' What evidence is there in the 1992 Cable Act to support this contention? 
(3) If the Copyright Office accepts the redesignations of Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia for copyright purposes,
should the Office accept any future redesignations? Should such acceptance be as a matter of course, or should it be
on a case-by-case basis? 
(4) If the Commission at some future date reranks markets on the list, and/or adds or subtracts markets, should the
Copyright Office recognize these changes as applicable to the cable compulsory license? If so, in the situation where
a reranking results in a cable system reducing its number of permitted distant signals, should the cable system be
allowed to continue to carry a former permitted distant signal on a grandfathered basis as a non-3.75% distant signal?

We received comments from the following parties: Federal Communications Commission (FCC); National Association
of Broadcasters (NAB); Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA); National Cable Television Association
(NCTA); Association of Independent Television Station, Inc. (INTV); Commissioner of Baseball, National Basketball
Association and National Hockey League (Professional Sports); Press Broadcasting, Company, Inc.; R&amp;R Media
Corporation; United Video, Inc.; Force Amusement Enterprises, Inc.; Providence Journal Company and Multivision
Cable TV Corporation; WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc.; TV 14, Inc.; and Cablevision Industries Corporation, Comcast Cable Communications,
Inc., Cox Cable Communications, Jones Intercable, Inc. and Newhouse Broadcasting Corporation (Joint Cable Operators).



IV. Summary of the Comments 


The comments reveal a general unanimity as to the effect of the 1992 Cable Act and the Commission's recent action regarding
&sect;76.51; the parties generally agree Congress did intend to affect copyright through the 1992 Cable Act, and
that the Copyright Office should observe the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia redesignations for cable compulsory
license purposes. While there is a slight difference of opinion as to how the Office should treat future FCC redesignations,
most parties stated that the issue of FCC rerankings of the top 100 television markets was not ripe for decision. 


a. Response to Question 1. 


Question 

#

1 addresses an extremely important legal issue: whether the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to update &sect;76.51
constituted an amendment of the FCC must-carry rules which were in effect in 1976. The Copyright Code requires application
only of the 1976 must-carry rules. 

See 

17 U.S.C. 111(f) (definition of a ``local service area of a primary transmitter''). With the exception of the MPAA,
all of the parties who addressed the issue agreed that the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to amend &sect;76.51
was not an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules. 
Professional Sports argues that amendment of &sect;76.51 by the FCC is not an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules
because &sect;76.51 was not part of the must-carry rules. Rather, the applicability of the 1976 must-carry rules
was determined only by reference to the &sect;76.51 list. Sports, however, qualifies the separability of &sect;76.51
from the 1976 must-carry rules by noting that a fundamental change in &sect;76.51 could amount to a de facto amendment
of the 1976 must-carry rules: [S]o long as the underlying structure of the [&sect;76.51] list remains unchanged,
a case-by-case modification of individual components of the list is an external event_comparable to modification
in the reach of a station's Grade B contour_which may affect a station's local service area under the 1976 must-carry
rules, but which does not alter the underlying principles by which calculation of a station's local service area is
made under those rules. *&blank;*&blank;* However, if at any time in the future the Commission reverses itself and
chooses to redefine the underlying structure of the 76.51 list, such a change could_depending on the nature of the
change_constitute an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules requiring a different response from the Copyright Office.

NAB supports the position that the 1992 Cable Act is not an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules. NAB notes that the
House Judiciary Committee Report accompanying the 1976 Copyright Act specifically omits mention of &sect;76.51
in its discussion of the must-carry rules, thereby indicating that Congress did not intend to freeze &sect;76.51
for compulsory license purposes: 
In explaining the definition of the ``local service area'' in Section 111(f) as being that area in which stations were
entitled to must carry under the FCC's rules in effect on April 15, 1976, this report specifically referenced Sections
76.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63. It did 

not

 reference Section 76.51. . . . The logical explanation for the omission of Section 76.51 is that Congress did not intend
to freeze, in perpetuity, the list of top 100 markets as they existed on April 15, 1976.

 

NAB, comments at 3 n.4. Press Broadcasting also argues that Congress must have intended not to freeze &sect;76.51;
otherwise the 1992 Cable Act direction to update the list would not make sense. Press Broadcasting, comments at 4.



The MPAA, unlike the other commentators, takes the position that the 1992 Cable Act is a separate and independent action
of Congress and is an amendment of the 1976 must-carry rules. MPAA, comments at 4. According to MPAA, however, the Copyright
Office still has authority to adopt the FCC changes to the &sect;76.51 list, but it is not statutorily bound by such
changes. MPAA compares the Cable Act amendment with the invalidation of the 1976 must-carry rules in the 

Quincy 

case. The invalidation of the must-carry rules ``was effectively an amendment of the 1976 regulations'' but the ``Copyright
Office did not eliminate local station carriage for royalty purposes.'' 

Id. 

The statutory justification for the Copyright Office to either accept or reject amendments of &sect;76.51 does not
come from whether there has been a change of the 1976 rules, but is the ``responsibility assigned . . . [the office] to
implement the provisions of the [compulsory license] plan. That responsibility requires the Office to determine
the appropriate copyright policy related to the circumstances.'' 

Id. 

MPAA asserts that the Copyright Office is free to either follow or reject FCC changes to &sect;76.51 depending upon
how they affect copyright policy. 


b. Response to Question 2. 


The FCC's 

Report and Order 

redesignating the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia markets concluded that Congress specifically intended to affect
copyright liability through its direction to the Commission to update &sect;76.51. In question 

#

2 we sought specific evidence to back the FCC's conclusion.
 
The FCC argues that the legislative history of the 1992 Cable Act clearly reflects Congress' intention to affect liability
under the cable compulsory license through its direction to the 1992 Commission to update the &sect;76.51 list. Although
we noted in our NOI that the amendment to the Cable Act offered by Congressman McEwen did not explain the reasons for
updating &sect;76.51, 

see 

58 FR at 34594 n. 1 (June 28, 1993), the FCC reveals that Rep. John Dingell, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy
and Commerce, did include a statement accompanying the McEwen amendment. ``The McEwen amendment requires the FCC
to update the list of the Nation's television markets in order to clarify whether a signal of a television station is
considered to be local or distant.'' Amendment No. 14, 138 Cong. Rec. H6529 (daily ed. July 23, 1992). Furthermore,
the FCC notes that Congressman McEwen represented the Sixth District of Ohio, which is where Chillocothe, one of the
Commission's redesignated markets, is located. FCC comments at 5. The FCC urges that it is therefore clear that Congress
attempted to affect copyright liability through the Cable Act: 
In short, the sequence of events, including the hyphenation of the Orlando market by the Commission and the acceptance
of that amendment of Section 76.51 for copyright purposes by the Copyright Office; the Copyright Office's [1992 cable]
report specifically bringing this to the attention of Congress; the specific problem associated with the Columbus-Chillocothe
television market and the response thereto; and the legislative history's indication that such changes were to define
stations as ``local'' or ``distant;'' all point to or are entirely consistent with a Congressional intention that
changes resulting from the inclusion of Section 614(f) in the 1992 Cable Act were intended to have both communications
and copyright consequences.

comments of R&amp;R Media Corp. and NAB. 


c. Response to Question 3. 


Question 

#

3 asks whether the Copyright Office, assuming it accepts the FCC's redesignations of the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia
markets, should accept future Commission redesignations as a matter of course or on a case-by-case basis. With the
exception of the MPAA, all parties addressing the issue believed that the Office should accept FCC redesignations
as a matter of course. 

See, e.g., 

Force Amusement Enterprises, Inc., comments at 1&hyph;2; NCTA, comments at 4; NAB, comments at 1&hyph;2; INTV, comments
at 4; WLIG-TV, Inc., comments at 1; Professional Sports, comments at 5&hyph;6; TV 14, Inc., comments at 1; Press Broadcasting,
comments at 3&hyph;4. Since the FCC announced in its 

Report &amp; Order 

that redesignations will be made on a case-by-case basis, the parties argue that this approach will provide the necessary
governmental scrutiny and avoid widescale market changes affecting the copyright status of distant signals. One
commentator declared: ``The addition or deletion of individual communities to or from designated markets listed
in &sect;76.51 of the Commission's Rules should have little overall effect on the cable copyright compulsory license
royalty scheme.'' Professional Sports, comments at 5. According to this commentator, reconsideration of each Commission
redesignation by the Copyright Office is therefore not only unnecessary, but unwise. Furthermore, several commentators
noted that acceptance of future redesignations for copyright purposes is consistent with the position taken by the
Office in its 1987 Policy Decision accepting the Florida and California redesignations, and with other Copyright
Office declarations on the subject. 
The MPAA is the one commentator arguing that we should not accept FCC redesignations as a matter of course. MPAA supports
acceptance of the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia redesignations by the Office for compulsory license purposes,
but states that the ``acceptance should be specifically limited to the current circumstances and should have no controlling
effect on future cases.'' MPAA, comments at 5. MPAA is concerned that the FCC may apply ADI (Area of Dominant Influence),
adopted by the 1992 Cable Act for determining must-carry status, to future redesignations. Widescale use of ADI could,
according to MPAA, transform the mere ``renaming'' of markets into a virtual ``reordering'' of the top 100 markets,
thereby dramatically affecting the compulsory license royalty scheme. MPAA, comments at 3 n.1. While this has not
yet happened, MPAA urges the Copyright Office to ``set clear guidelines now to govern cable royalty reporting and
payment practices in the event the FCC replaces the 1970 major market list with one based on current ADI designations.''

Parties submitting reply comments in this proceeding were critical of the MPAA's rejection of acceptance of future
redesignations and its admonition urging the Copyright Office to set guidelines. 

See

 Force Amusement Enterprises, Inc., reply comments at 2; NAB, reply comments at 4; INTV, reply comments at 6. Force
underscores that the Commission specifically declined in its 

Report &amp; Order 

to make wholesale changes in the major television market list, and that ``[u]nless and until such a major policy shift
is actually considered by the FCC,'' reason dictates following the Commission's case-by-case redesignations.
The reply commentators were also critical of the MPAA's recommendation that we adopt guidelines to evaluate the copyright
consequences of future redesignations. They state that MPAA offers no argument or suggestions as to_1) why the criteria
used by the FCC in making such redesignations are inadequate for copyright purposes; 2) what criteria, other than
those employed by the FCC, the Copyright Office should use independently to evaluate market redesignations; or 3)
the policy justification for, in essence, creating two separate major market lists.

 

NAB, reply comments at 4. Another commentator argued that adoption of guidelines would also be an unjustified rejection
of our 1987 Policy Decision to accept Commission redesignations for cable license purposes. INTV, reply comments

d. Response to Question 4. 


Question 

#

4 raises the issue of possible future reranking of markets on the &sect;76.51 list and asks what effect reranking should
have on the copyright status of distant signals. Since the FCC has not received a petition for reranking of markets,
several commentators have suggested that the copyright implications of such an action are not ripe for decision.
Parties aligned with cable interests support the view that current cable system carriage of permitted distant signals
should be grandfathered, while copyright interests argue that the grandfathering of distant signals would be bad
copyright policy resulting in considerable harm to the compulsory license royalty scheme. 
In announcing its practice for handling future revisions of the &sect;76.51 list, the FCC did not address the possibility
of reorganizing the order of the top 100 markets. 

See Report &amp; Order, 

8 FCC Rcd at 2979 (1993) (FCC not ready to consider reranking on basis of present record). We noted in our NOI to this proceeding
that since the Commission did not announce a definitive position on reranking of markets, ``[i]t is therefore possible
that future changes to the &sect;76.51 list may include both reranking and renaming, although probably in limited
circumstances.'' NOI, 58 FR at 34595 (June 28, 1993). Reranking would present the possibility of changes in the number
of permitted/non-permitted distant signals that a cable system located in a top 100 market could carry, since the
&sect;76.51 list also had significance for the Commission's former distant signal carriage rules. 
For example, a cable system located in a second 50 market can generally carry two distant signals at the permitted base
rate copyright royalty fee. Additional distant signals must be reported at the more expensive non-permitted 3.75%
royalty fee. If a reranking of markets occurs and the cable system moves into the top 50 markets, then, according to
the FCC's former distant signal carriage rules, the cable system could potentially carry three permitted base rate
signals, instead of just two. If a reranking resulted in a cable system moving from the top 50 to the second 50, then the
cable system would lose a base rate distant signal and possibly incur the 3.75% royalty for that signal. Concerned
about the potential for a change in royalty status of current distant signals, we sought in Question 

#

4 to elicit comment as to the possibility of grandfathering the royalty status of signals despite the effects of market
reordering. 
Because the FCC has yet to receive a petition for reranking of the &sect;76.51 list or to consider the issue, several
commentators urge that the copyright implications of a reranking are not ripe for decision. Press Broadcasting,
comments at 9; Professional Sports, comments at 1; NCTA, comments at 3. Noting that the questions involving market
ranking versus market redesignation involve ``very different considerations,'' INTV urges that ``until the FCC
is willing to revisit the ranking aspect of &sect;76.51, the Copyright Office need not rush into the matter.'' INTV,
comments at 22. Professional Sports also urges restraint, encouraging the Office to seek further comment at such
time as the Commission does consider reranking. Professional Sports, comments at 9&hyph;10. 
Commentators aligned with cable argue that the Copyright Office must apply grandfathering principles to any reranking
of television markets. 

See 

comments of United Video, Providence Journal, NCTA, INTV, and Joint Cable Operators. Citing the ``no rollback policy''
used by the Commission to apply its former distant signal carriage rules, these commentators state that the grandfathering
of carriage of distant signals is critical to continued carriage of existing distant signals. The FCC specifically
allowed for grandfathering of distant signals which had been carried prior to a rule change, so as to prevent carriage
disruption. 

See, e.g.,

 36 FCC2d 143 (1972) (grandfathering signals carried prior to new distant signal and syndicated exclusivity rules);
54 FCC2d 265 (1975) (grandfathering distant signal sports imported prior to new restriction). The commentators
note that the Copyright Office has also observed the practice of grandfathering. 

See

 Letter of Dorothy Schrader, Copyright Office General Counsel, to Peter H. Feinberg of January 31, 1990 (grandfathering
of permitted signal after change in station's community of license from major market to nearby smaller market community);
Letter of Dorothy Schrader, Copyright Office General Counsel, to Irving Gastfreund of December 11, 1986 (grandfathering
of permitted distant signals where area formerly located outside all markets becomes smaller market). Joint Cable
Operators argue that there is no precedent for the Copyright Office to refuse to grandfather carriage of existing
distant signals at the permitted base royalty rate. Thus, where a cable system moves from the top 50 to a second 50 market,
or from a top 50 or second 50 market to a smaller market, we could not assess the 3.75% royalty rate against distant signals
formerly carried on a permitted basis. Joint Cable Operators, comments at 3, Providence Journal, comments at 3, United
Video, comments at 2&hyph;3.

MPAA opposes application of the practice of grandfathering permitted signals. According to MPAA, if the Commission
engages in a reranking of markets, ``the Office must either accept the reordering entirely or not at all for copyright
royalty purposes.'' MPAA, comments at 5. If reranking results in a second 50 market moving to the first 50, cable systems
in that newly reranked market would gain an additional permitted signal. However, cable systems located in a market
that loses one or more permitted signals as a result of reordering would have to pay the increased 3.75% royalty rate
for those signals. This must be so because the practice of grandfathering would unfairly advantage cable systems:
they would gain the benefit of additional permitted signals when their markets move up the &sect;76.51 list, but would
not lose any permitted signals when their markets move down the list. 

Id.

 at 6. Permitting grandfathering would, in MPAA's opinion, create as a practical result a &sect;76.51 list which,
for copyright purposes, would treat more than 50 markets as being top 50 markets since cable operators in markets dropping
out of the top 50 as the result of an FCC reranking would still retain the copyright benefits of being a top 50 market.


Id

. at 7. Full acceptance or rejection of a Commission reranking will preserve balance in the royalty scheme. 

Id

. 


United Video criticizes MPAA's position, submitting that ``the issue should not be maintaining precise balance
or `imbalance' in the royalty plan or whether cable systems receive some minimal advantage or disadvantage. The primary
issue and consideration in this proceeding should be the public interest in avoiding disruption of television signal
carriage.'' 
United Video, reply comments at 2. Joint Cable Operators state that ``[w]hile the idea of cable systems gaining or
losing permitted signals as they move up or down the major market list has a certain `symmetrical' appeal to it, the
result will be needless disruption in service to viewers.'' Joint Cable Operators, comments at 3. 




e. Policy Considerations. 




In addition to responding to our questions, several commentators offered other reasons for accepting any and all
changes to the &sect;76.51 list. In what can loosely be categorized as ``policy considerations,'' these parties
ask us to continue our 1987 Policy Decision accepting FCC redesignations and give effect to Congressional efforts
to harmonize the cable compulsory license with the 1992 Cable Act. 



Several commentators aligned with broadcast and cable interests argue that the current proceeding is unnecessary
because we already resolved the handling of &sect;76.51 redesignations in our 1987 proceeding. 

See, e.g.

, Press Broadcasting, comments at 3&hyph;4; NCTA, comments at 4; INTV, comments. They underscore that the Office's
1987 statement ``formally adopts the view that signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former
must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market redesignation order are to be treated as local signals for purposes of
the cable compulsory license,'' 52 FR 28362 (July 29, 1987), and argue that nothing supports a change in this position.
They argue that if the Office ignored its 1987 Policy Decision and did not follow Commission redesignations, then
the Office would in effect be making its own determination of market status. R&amp;R Media Corp., comments at 6. 

See also 

NAB, comments at 4&hyph;5 (Copyright Office has no authority to ignore FCC changes to &sect;76.51). 



According to INTV, maintaining the 1987 practice is ``more likely to promote the basic policy goal of copyright.''
INTV, comments at 18. We ``must resist the superficial notion which suggests that enlarging stations' copyright
local area would decrease the cable royalty pool,'' and recognize that the addition of communities to &sect;76.51
markets will increase carriage of broadcast stations not previously carried by cable systems in those markets because
of distant royalty fees. 

Id. 

at 19. Increased carriage will make more broadcast stations stronger, and ``stations then will be in a position to
pay more for programming. This enhances the value of the program owners' copyrights and assures an enhanced reward
for use of their works. Program production is stimulated, and the goal of copyright is furthered.'' 

Id

. at 20. 



Several commentators also argue that the Copyright Office's refusal to follow &sect;76.51 changes would frustrate
policy goals of the 1992 Cable Act. Press Broadcasting notes the language in the House version of the 1992 Cable Act,
stating ``[n]othing in this section shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect title 17, United States Code,''
was deliberately omitted from the Senate version that ultimately became the law. Press Broadcasting, comments at
8. ``By deleting language which would have rendered the Copyright Act immutable in the face of the 1992 Cable Act, Congress
has at least strongly suggested that the latter legislation, being Congress' most recent action in the area, should
be deemed to take precedence over the 17 year-old Copyright Act to the limited extent that any conflict between the
two may be perceived.'' 

Id

. at 8. 


INTV argues that Congress' direction in the 1992 Cable Act to update &sect;76.51 is an effort to harmonize what is a
local signal for both the Cable Act and section 111 of the Copyright Code. INTV, reply comments at 1&hyph;2. Through
the 1992 Cable Act, Congress abandoned the unnecessarily restrictive and difficult to administer 1976 must-carry
definition of a local signal, employing the more rationally based ADI concept. Congress also gave the FCC authority
to adjust ADI determinations in situations where application of ADI would result in broadcast stations in the same
market being treated differently. INTV, comments at 8 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 268, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. 98 (1992)). According
to INTV, updating &sect;76.51 promotes both goals of ADI-wide carriage and parity among stations. Failure to recognize
market redesignations for compulsory copyright license purposes ``would hinder ADI-wide carriage and promote
competitive disparity among broadcast stations in the same market.'' 

Id

. at 9. 


V. Policy Decision 




We have fully considered the record in this proceeding and are satisfied that the 1992 Cable Act's amendment of the
Communications Act of 1934 requiring that the FCC make ``necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of
the Code of Federal Regulations'' is not a substantive change of the ``rules, regulations, and authorizations of
the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976.'' As a matter of sound copyright policy, we will
therefore observe the redesignations of the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia markets contained in the Commission's
March 29, 1993, 

Report &amp; Order 

for purposes of calculating royalty fees under the cable compulsory license, 17 U.S.C. 111. We will also observe for
cable compulsory license purposes other FCC redesignations_defined as the addition or deletion of communities
to the markets contained on the &sect;76.51 list_made after March 29, 1993. We do not, at this time, take a position
with respect to the reranking of markets by the FCC_defined as the reordering and/or addition or deletion of markets
contained on the &sect;76.51 list_and its effects on the calculation of the royalty fees under 17 U.S.C. 111.

The Copyright Code defines the local service area of a broadcast station as the area in which the station would be entitled
to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system in accordance with ``the rules, regulations, and authorizations
of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976''_

i.e.

, the 1976 must-carry rules. 17 U.S.C. 111(f). There is no question that in creating the cable compulsory license,
Congress chose to freeze the 1976 must-carry rules for purposes of calculating cable copyright royalties. H.R. Rep.
No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1976). The purpose of freezing the must-carry rules was to insure that any subsequent
rule amendments by the FCC that either increase or decrease the size of the local service area for its purposes do not
change the definition for copyright purposes. The Committee believes that any such change for copyright purposes,
which would materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation, should only be made by an amendment
to the statute.






Id. 




Because Congress froze the 1976 must-carry rules for copyright purposes in determining local signals, we must resolve
whether Congress also intended to freeze the major television market list as it was in 1976. We are persuaded by the
legislative history of the Copyright Code, and the supporting views of the majority of commentators to this proceeding,
that Congress did not intend to freeze &sect;76.51, and that FCC redesignations of markets on the list are not substantive
changes to the 1976 must-carry rules. In describing the must-carry area for the definition of the local service area
of a broadcast signal, the 1976 House Committee Report specifically listed the FCC rules that contained must-carry
provisions: ``Under FCC rules and regulations this so-called must-carry area is defined based on the market size
and position of cable systems in 47 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;76.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63.'' Id.

 Omission of &sect;76.51 is not surprising since &sect;76.51 is not a must-carry rule; &sect;76.51 is only incorporated
by reference to must-carry determinations. We therefore reaffirm the conclusions announced in our 1987 Policy Decision:
(1) Congress did not intend &sect;76.51 to be frozen to its April 15, 1976 status for purposes of determining cable
systems' local service area and copyright royalty fees; and (2) when the FCC amends its major television market list
in 47 CFR 76.51, there has been no substantive rule change effected so as to impact calculations of cable copyright
royalties.

Our NOI questioned whether the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the FCC to update &sect;76.51 sought to bring a change
in the copyright laws or the cable compulsory license. 

See 

58 FR at 34594 n. 1 (June 28, 1993) (``It cannot be definitively said that Congress sought to bring about a change in the
copyright laws or the administration of the cable compulsory license through this provision.''). Some of the commentators
to this proceeding have produced evidence in the legislative history that is strongly suggestive of a congressional
effort to clarify the local/distant status of broadcast signals. This history includes correspondence between
the licensee of WWAT (TV) Chillocothe, Ohio, one of the communities subject to the 1993 FCC redesignation; and Rep.
McEwen requesting an amendment to the 1992 Cable Act to redesignate the Columbus, Ohio market to include Chillocothe,
R &amp; R Media Corp. comments, at appendix; and a statement of Rep. John Dingell, Chairman of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce, endorsing the adoption of the McEwen amendment into the 1992 Cable Act requiring the FCC to update
&sect;76.51 of its rules, 138 Cong. Rec. H6529 (daily ed. July 23, 1992). Moreover, the Senate version, which ultimately
became the law, omitted the language in the 1992 House cable bill, stating that nothing in the bill should be construed
to affect the Copyright Act. 



We conclude that it is sound copyright policy to accept the FCC's redesignations

4

 of markets in the &sect;76.51 list for cable compulsory license purposes beginning with the Commission's March 29,
1993, Report &amp; Order redesignating the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia markets. Acceptance of redesignations
promotes greater uniformity between the operation of the copyright and communications laws, and is a better assessment
of the reality of modern television marketplaces. Broadcast stations that for all intents and purposes compete and
operate in a major television market can, through FCC redesignation, establish their location within that market.
Their localition within that market should be recognized with respect to the cable compulsory license. All of the
commentators agree that it is permissible for the Copyright Office to recognize FCC market redesignations of &sect;76.51
for purposes of 17 U.S.C. 111. We therefore reaffirm our 1987 Policy Decision by ``formally adopt[ing] the view that
signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market
redesignation order are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license.'' 52 FR 28366
(July 29, 1987). 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
By ``redesignation,'' we mean the addition or deletion of communities to the top 100 television markets already appearing
on the &sect;76.51 list. 



</FOOTNOTE>


While we will accept market redesignations now and in the future, we are aware of the possibility that, over time, a
large number of market redesignations could dramatically affect the royalty structure of the cable compulsory license.
There were approximately 400 petitions for redesignation pending at the FCC when the Copyright Office began its inquiry
into &sect;76.51 in 1985, 

see 

52 FR at 28366, and while there is nowhere near that number before the FCC at this time, it is difficult to predict how
many redesignation petitions the Commission will receive in the future. Extensive addition of new communities to
existing markets could significantly raise the number of local signals carried by cable systems, thereby resulting
in considerable decreases in royalties paid for distant signals. While we have said that we will accept future FCC
redesignations as a matter of course, we are mindful that Congress expressly chose to freeze the 1976 must-carry rules
for copyright purposes so as not to ``materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation.'' H.R.
Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1976). Should there come a day when the number of redesignations ``materially
affect[s] the royalty fee payments'' under the cable compulsory license, the Copyright Office may find it necessary
to make its concerns public, to call the issue to the attention of Congress, and petition for a legislative solution.




In addition to market redesignations, we have also considered the issue of possible future reranking of markets on
the &sect;76.51 list. Reranking would be the reordering of markets as they appear in &sect;76.51, including the addition
or deletion of markets. Because the FCC has currently declined to consider the reranking of major television markets,


see Report &amp; Order,

 8 FCC Rcd 2965, 2978 (1994), and there is no petition before the Commission seeking a reranking of &sect;76.51, we agree
with the majority of commentators that the results of reranking on Copyright Office policy are not ripe for decision
at this time. 


We are, however, troubled by the implications of reranking. In its comments the Federal Communications Commission,
in discussing its 1993 

Report &amp; Order 

updating &sect;76.51, noted that the commentators to that proceeding ``generally suggested that the FCC not rerank
markets.'' FCC, comments at 3. In a footnote, the FCC added: Those opposing a reranking of the markets generally contend
that such action was unnecessary, impractical or would result in confusion and instability. However, in recognition
of the dual communications and copyright implications of Section 76.51, virtually all commentators agreed that
any changes with respect to market rankings be done in conjunction with the Copyright Office. 






Id

. n. 11. We heartily agree that, should the FCC consider a reranking of &sect;76.51 in the future, it is both necessary
and proper for the Commission and the Copyright Office to consult with one another, and we welcome the opportunity
to work with the Commission on such an important issue, should the need arise. 




In spite of our considerable doubts on the matter, we do not take a position as to what effect, if any, an FCC reranking
of the &sect;76.51 major television market list would have on the section 111 cable compulsory license because a decision
on this issue would be premature at this time.

<RINDOCK>[Docket Nos. Stn 50&hyph;528, Stn 50&hyph;529, and Stn 50&hyph;530]</RINDOCK>



Arizona Public Service Co.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 Environmental Assessment and
Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74, issued to Arizona
Public Service Company, (the licensee), for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and
3 (Palo Verde), located in Maricopa County, Arizona.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system of site access control so that photograph
identification badges can be taken offsite.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated April 29, 1994, for exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage.''



The Need for the Proposed Action



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security
organization. Paragraph 1 of 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies that the ``licensee shall control
all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Title 10 of the 

Code of Federal Regulations, 

paragraph 73.55(d)(5), specifies that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Paragraph 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual
not employed by the licensee (i.e., a contractor) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided
the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from
the protected area.''

Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the Palo Verde units is controlled through the use of a photograph
on a combination badge and keycard (hereinafter, these are referred to as the badge). The security officers at each
entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges
for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance
at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit
location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contract individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In
accordance with the plants' physical security plans, neither licensee employees nor contractors are allowed to
take badges offsite.

The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badges with them when departing the site. An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors
to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The staff has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application. Under the proposed system, individuals who
are authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand
geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into
the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image.
The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared with the previously stored template to verify
authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their
badge with them when they depart the site.

Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91&hyph;0276
UC&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991) and on the licensee's experience with the current photo identification
system, the licensee demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control.
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge
offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into the protected area. The licensee will implement a process for
testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the
regulation. The Physical Security Plans for Palo Verde will be revised to include implementation and testing of the
hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their badges offsite.

The access will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts.
Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area. Accordingly, the Commission
concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change does not affect nonradiological plant effluents
and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Arizona State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of opportunity for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to issue a generic letter. A generic letter is an NRC document
that: (1) Requests licensees to submit analyses or descriptions of proposed corrective actions, or both, regarding
matters of safety, safeguards, or environmental significance, or (2) requests licensees to submit information
to the NRC on other technical or administrative matters, or (3) transmits information to licensees regarding approved
changes to rules or regulations, the issuance of reports or evaluations of interest to the industry, or changes to
NRC administrative procedures. When issued, this generic letter will provide guidance for licensees who may wish
to request a license amendment to the plant technical specifications to implement an alternate steam generator tube
repair limit applicable specifically to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking at the tube-to-tube support
plate intersections in Westinghouse designed steam generators having drilled-hole tube support plates. This generic
letter is intended to provide relief while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for licensees having steam generators
experiencing this particular degradation mechanism while the NRC pursues a longer term resolution to the issue of
steam generator degradation through the development of a steam generator rule. The NRC is seeking comment from interested
parties regarding both the technical and regulatory aspects of the proposed generic letter presented under the Supplementary
Information heading. Additionally, the NRC is seeking public comments on the following question which pertains
to the technical positions described in the proposed generic letter. The voltage-based repair methodology and calculational
approach incorporates numerous conservatism throughout the calculation in part to bound uncertainties that currently
exist in the methodology. The NRC is soliciting public comment on the propagation of uncertainties through the leakage
rate and radiological dose calculations under postulated accident conditions and the appropriateness of the conservatism
that have been included in the analyses to account for these uncertainties. Two examples of uncertainties in the voltage-based
repair methodology and calculational approach are: (1) Several functional forms (in addition to the log-logistic
curve used in the proposed generic letter) can be fit to the available probability of leakage data equally well from
the standpoint of a statistical goodness of fit, and (2) there is a paucity of definitive data describing iodine releases
into the reactor coolant system following a large depressurization transient such as the postulated main steam line
break.



During development of the proposed generic letter, three individual NRC staff members expressed technical concerns
(including one member filing a differing professional opinion) with the NRC positions described in the generic letter,
in response to an internal memorandum requesting such comments. The differing professional opinion is currently
being processed in accordance with the established NRC procedures. The NRC policies on differing professional opinions
(DPOs) or differing professional views (DPVs) were established to ensure employees have the ability to freely express
their DPOs or DPVs and to underscore management's intention to address these concerns in a timely and responsible
manner. The NRC has decided to make these technical concerns and the differing professional opinion publicly available
as part of the information available in the Public Document Rooms, and to provide the public an opportunity to comment
on these concerns as they may relate to the draft generic letter. The NRC held internal technical interactions with
the three individuals regarding their technical concerns and gave the concerns careful consideration (the concerns
did not necessarily result in revisions to the proposed generic letter nor were they necessarily resolved to the individuals'
satisfaction) during development and review of the proposed generic letter. The technical concerns and differing
professional opinion are briefly summarized as follows: (1) The first concern is that use of the eddy current voltage
repair criteria could result in leakage rates following a postulated main steam line break that could ultimately
exceed the make-up capacity of the refueling water storage tank for the emergency core cooling system supply and result
in core damage. The concern stems from the belief that there is no direct relation between leakage and measured eddy
current voltage. (2) The second concern is that there is no physical basis for choosing a given probability of leakage
(POL) function versus other POL functions, when all functions fit the available data from a statistical standpoint.
(3) The third concern stems from the application of a voltage-based repair criterion when there is not a unique correlation
between voltage amplitude and physical parameters (i.e., length or depth) of a defect that can be directly related
to tube structural integrity or leakage. The DPO is similar to technical concern: (1) With additional concerns raised
regarding the paucity of iodine spiking data for the calculation of offsite doses for a postulated main steam line
break with induced steam generator tube leakage and the effectiveness of reducing reactor coolant system iodine
activity for reducing calculated offsite doses. The summaries above are not intended to oversimplify the expressed
technical concerns or differing professional opinion. To fully understand the concerns, it is recommended that
each concern be read in its entirety. The proposed generic letter and supporting documentation were discussed in
the 260th meeting of the Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR). At this meeting, the three individual NRC
staff members presented their technical concerns to the CRGR. The relevant information used to support CRGR review
of the proposed generic letter will be available in the Public Document Rooms. In addition, the proposed generic letter
and supporting documentation were discussed in a meeting of the Materials and Metallurgy Subcommittee of the NRC
Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) on August 3, 1994, as well as a full ACRS meeting held on August 4, 1994.

The NRC will consider comments received from interested parties in the final evaluation of the proposed generic letter.
The NRC final evaluation will include a review of the technical position and, when appropriate, an analysis of the
value/impact on licensees. Should this generic letter be issued in final form by the NRC, it will become available
for public inspection in the Public Document Rooms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION




NRC Generic Letter 94&hyph;XX: Voltage-Based Repair Criteria For The Repair of Westinghouse Steam Generator Tubes
Affected by Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking




Addressees





All holders of operating licenses or construction permits for nuclear power reactors having steam generators designed
by Westinghouse Electric Corporation (W).




Purpose





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this guidance for licensees who may wish to request a license
amendment to the plant technical specifications to implement an alternate steam generator tube repair limit applicable
specifically to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) at the tube-to-tube support plant intersections
in Westinghouse designed steam generators having drilled-hole tube support plates (TSP). The NRC has previously
allowed a few licensees to implement alternate steam generator repair criteria for this particular degradation
mechanism on an operating cycle specific basis. This generic letter does not restrict the approval of such repair
criteria to a cycle specific basis.



Current plant technical specifications require that flawed tubes be removed from service by plugging or repaired
by sleeving, if the depths of the flaws exceed the repair limit, typically 40 percent through-wall. This generic letter
provides guidance on the implementation of an alternate repair criterion to be applied to ODSCC at TSP locations.
This criterion does not set limits on the depth of the cracks to ensure tube integrity margins; instead, it relies on
correlating the eddy current voltage amplitude from a bobbin coil probe with the more specific measurement of burst
pressure and leak rate.



This generic letter is intended to provide relief while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for licensees having
steam generators experiencing this particular degradation mechanism while the staff pursues a longer term resolution
to the issue of steam generator degradation through the development of a steam generator rule. Although this generic
letter allows licensees to pursue various options regarding the implementation of the voltage-based criteria (e.g.,
tube support place deflection analyses, probability of detection versus voltage dependence), licensees should
recognize that pursuing such options could have significant scheduler implications since the NRC staff would be
required to review and approve the associated information and analyses. Regarding the correlations and supporting
data utilized to implement the generic letter guidance, the staff will review this information on an as-required
basis to enable updated correlations and new data to be used for implementation of the generic letter guidance. The
NRC staff will make publicly available an updated list of approved correlations and models on a periodic basis.




Background





The thin-walled tubing of the steam generator constitutes more than half of the reactor coolant pressure boundary
(RCPB). Maintenance of the structural and leakage integrity of the RCPB is a requirement under Title 10 of the Code
of Federal Regulations Part 50 (10 CFR 50), Appendix A. Specific requirements governing the maintenance of steam
generator tube integrity are contained in the plant technical specifications and Section XI of the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code). These include requirements for periodic
inservice inspection of the tubing, flaw acceptance criteria (i.e., repair limits for plugging or sleeving), and
primary-to-secondary leakage limits. These requirements coupled with the broad scope of plant operational and
maintenance programs, have formed the basis for assuring adequate steam generator tube integrity.



Flaw acceptance criteria, termed plugging/repair limits, are specified in the plant technical specifications.
The purpose of the technical specification repair limits is to ensure that tubes accepted for continued service will
retain adequate structural and leakage integrity during normal operating, transient, and postulated accident
conditions, consistent with General Design Criteria (GDC) 14, 15, 30, 31, and 32 of 10 CFR part 50, appendix A. Structural
integrity refers to maintaining adequate margins against gross failure, rupture, and collapse of the steam generator
tubing. Leakage integrity refers to limiting primary-to-secondary leakage to within acceptable limits.



The traditional strategy for accomplishing the objectives of the General Design Criteria related to steam generator
tube integrity has been to establish a minimum wall thickness requirement in accordance with the structural criteria
of Regulatory Guide 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded PWR Steam Generator Tubes.'' Development of minimum wall
thickness requirements to satisfy Regulatory Guide 1.121 was governed by analyses for uniform thinning of the tube
wall in the axial and circumferential directions. The assumption of uniform thinning conservatively bonds the degrading
effects of all flaw types occurring in the field, and is the basis of the standard 40 percent depth-based plugging limit
incorporated into the technical specifications. However, the 40 percent repair limit is conservative for highly
localized flaws such as pits and short cracks. In particular, the 40 percent depth-based repair limit is conservative
for outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) that occurs at the tube support plates.



The new voltage-based repair limit does not incorporate a minimum wall thickness requirement. The voltage-based
repair limit allows the possibility that tubes with up to 100 percent through-wall cracks, which may develop between
successive steam generator inspections, can remain in service, subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions
ensure structural integrity and leakage limits consistent with the applicable GDC of 10 CFR part 50 appendix A and
the limits of 10 CFR Part 100. Although the voltage-based repair limit ensures adequate structural integrity and
leakage limits, the NRC staff recognizes that overall margins have been reduced when compared to the margins associated
with the existing 40% depth-based repair limit.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Because of the increased likelihood of through-wall cracks developing in service, the staff has included provisions
for augmented steam generator inspections and more restrictive operational tube leakage limits in the generic letter
guidance.

proposed in the draft generic letter.

In taking the interim action described in this letter, the NRC staff wishes to emphasize that, while use of the specific
voltage-based repair methods described herein is approved as an acceptable short-term measure for dealing with
ODSCC tube degradation, this action should not be construed to discourage the use by licensees of better or further
refined data acquisition techniques, eddy current technology, and eddy current data analysis as they become available;
and the staff strongly encourages the industry to continue its efforts to improve the nondestructive examination
of steam generator tubes. The staff continues to believe that inspection methods and repair criteria based on physical
dimensions (e.g., length and depth) of defects are the most desirable when they can be achieved.



Discussion



1. Overview of the Voltage Repair Limit Approach



In order to use the voltage repair criteria, licensees should complete the following actions:




_Perform an enhanced inspection of tubes, particularly at the tube support plate (TSP) intersections,

_Utilize nondestructive examination (NDE) data acquisition and analysis procedures that are consistent with the
methodology used to develop the voltage-based repair limits,

_Repair or plug tubes that exceed the voltage limits,

_Determine the beginning of cycle voltage distribution,

_Project the end-of-cycle (EOC) distribution, 

_For the projected EOC voltage distribution, calculate leakage and conditional burst probability (and repair additional
tubes if necessary).




2. Generic Letter Applicability



The criteria in this generic letter are only applicable to ODSCC located at the tube-to-tube support plate intersections
in Westinghouse designed steam generators. These criteria are not applicable to other forms of steam generator tube
degradation, nor are they applicable to ODSCC that occurs at other locations within a steam generator. The voltage-based
repair criteria can be applied only under the following constraints:

(1) The repair criteria of this generic letter apply only to Westinghouse designed steam generators with 1.9 cm [3/4
inch] and 2.2 cm [7/8 inch] diameter tubes and drilled hole tube support plates,

(2) The repair criteria of this generic letter apply only to predominantly axially oriented ODSCC confined within
the tube-to-tube support plate intersection (refer to Section 1.a of Enclosure 1 for further guidance) and,

(3) Certain intersections are excluded from the application of the voltage-based repair criteria as discussed in
Section 1.b of Enclosure 1.

<PARENT> FR940812-2-00068 </PARENT>

The voltage repair limits are:

(1) for 2.2 cm [7/8 inch] diameter tubes:

&bull;Indications below 2.0 volts as measured by bobbin coil may remain in service;

&bull;Indications between 2.0 and 5.6 volts as measured by bobbin coil can remain in service if motorized rotating
pancake coil (MRPC) inspections do not confirm the indications; and

&bull;Indications between 2.0 and 5.6 volts as measured by bobbin coil that are confirmed by MRPC and indications
exceeding 5.6 volts as measured by bobbin coil must be repaired.

(2) For 1.9 cm [3/4-inch] diameter tubes.


&bull;Indications below 1.0 volt as measured by bobbin coil may remain in service;


&bull;Indications between 1.0 and 2.7 volts as measured by bobbin coil can remain in service if MRPC inspections do
not confirm the indications; and

&bull;Indications between 1.0 and 2.7 volts as measured by robin coil that are confirmed by MRPC and indications exceeding
2.7 volts as measured by bobbin coil must be repaired.


The voltage-based repair limits of this generic letter were determined considering the entire range of design basis
events that could challenge tube integrity. The voltage repair limits ensure structural integrity and leakage limits
for all postulated design basis events. The structural criteria are intended to ensure that tubes subjected to the
voltage repair limits will be able to withstand a pressure of 1.4 times a maximum possible main steam line break (MSLB)
differential pressure postulated to occur at the end of the operating cycle consistent with the criteria of Regulatory
Guide 1.121. The leakage criteria ensure that for tubes subject to the voltage repair limits, induced leakage under
worst-case MSLB conditions calculated using licensing basis assumptions, will not result in offsite dose releases
that exceed the applicable limits of 10 CFR Part 100.



Requested Actions



Implementation of the guidance in this generic letter is voluntary. If a licensee chooses to implement these criteria,
the following should be included in the proposed program:

(1) Implementation of the inspection guidance discussed in Section 3 of Enclosure 1. The inspection guidance ensures
that the techniques used to inspect steam generators are consistent with the techniques used to develop voltage-based
repair limit methodology.

(2) Calculation of leakage per the guidance of Section 2.b of Enclosure 1. This calculation, in conjunction with the
use of licensing basis assumptions for calculating offsite releases, enables licensees to demonstrate that the
applicable limits of 10 CFR Part 100 continue to be met.

(3) Calculation of conditional burst probability per the guidance of Section 2.a of Enclosure 1. This is a calculation
to assess the voltage distribution left in service against a threshold value.

(4) Implementation of the operational leakage limits identified in Section 5 of Enclosure 1. The operational leak
limit is a defense-in-depth measure that provides a means for identifying leaks during operation to enable repair
before such leaks result in tube failure.

(5) Review of leakage monitoring measures including the procedures for timely detection, trending, and response
to rapidly increasing leaks. The objective is to ensure that should a significant leak be experienced in service,
it will be detected and the plant shut down in a timely manner to reduce the likelihood of a potential rupture.

(6) Acquisition of tube pull data per the guidance of Section 4 of Enclosure 1. It is necessary to acquire pulled tube
data to confirm the degradation mechanism.

(7) Reporting of results per the guidance of Section 6 of Enclosure 1.

(8) Submittal of a technical specification (TS) amendment request that commits to the above and provides TS pages
per the guidance of Enclosure 2 including the associated consideration of no significant hazards consideration
(10 CFR 50.92) and supporting safety analysis.

Licensees that plan to adopt this TS amendment are encouraged to follow the guidance given in Enclosures 1 and 2. The
staff requests that licensees following the guidance of this generic letter submit their TX amendment request at
least 90 days prior to the beginning of the refueling outage during which the alternate repair criteria are to be implemented.



Backfit Discussion



Licensee action to propose TS changes under the guidance of this generic letter is voluntary; therefore, such action
is not a backfit under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.109.

Guidance for a Proposed License Amendment To Implement an Alternate Steam Generator Tube Repair Limit for Outside
Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at the Tube Support Plate Intersections 



1. Introduction 



This guidance provides the NRC staff position on the implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria in steam
generators designed by Westinghouse for outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) located at the tube-to-tube
support plate intersections. This guidance is not applicable to other forms of steam generator tube degradation
nor is it applicable to ODSCC that occurs at other locations with the steam generator. The voltage-based repair criteria
have been developed for, and are currently applicable only to, Westinghouse-designed steam generators with 2.2
cm [7/8-inch] or 1.9 cm [3/4-inch] diameter tubes with drilled hole tube support plates (TSPs). Application of the
alternate repair criteria to other vendor designed steam generators would require both the development and NRC staff
review and approval of a comparable data base and the associated correlations for each vendor steam generator type.


The NRC staff wants to emphasize that while the NRC has approved the implementation of the voltage-based repair methods
described in this generic letter as a short-term measure, this guidance should not be construed to discourage the
development and use of better acquisition techniques, eddy current technology, and eddy current data analysis.
The staff strongly encourages the industry to continue to improve the NDE of steam generator tubes. 



1.a&blank;ODSCC 



The voltage-based repair criteria are applicable only to indications at support plate intersections where the degradation
mechanism is dominantly axial ODSCC with no significant cracks extending outside the thickness of the support plate.


For purposes of this guidance, OSDCC refers to degradation whose dominant morphology consists of axial stress corrosion
cracks which occur either singularly or in networks of multiple cracks, sometimes with limited patches of general
intergranular attack (IGA). Circumferential cracks may sometimes occur in the IGA affected regions resulting in
a grid-like pattern of axial and circumferential cracks, termed cellular corrosion. Cellular corrosion is assumed
to be relatively shallow (based on available data from tube specimens removed from the field), transitioning to dominantly
axial cracks as the cracking progresses in depth. The circumferential cracks are assumed (based on available data)
not to be of sufficient size to produce a discrete, crack-like circumferential indication during field nondestructive
examination (NDE) inspections. Thus, the failure mode of ODSCC is axial and the burst pressure is controlled by the
geometry of the most limiting axial crack or array of axial cracks. 

It is also assumed for purposes of this guidance that the ODSCC is confined to within the thickness of the tube support
plate, based on available data from tube specimens removed from the field. Very shallow microcracks are sometimes
observed on these specimens to initiate at locations slightly outside the thickness of the tube support plate; however,
these microcracks are small compared to the cracks within the thickness of the support plate and are too small to produce
an eddy current response. 

Confirmation that the degradation mechanism is dominantly axial ODSCC should be accomplished by periodically removing
tube specimens from the steam generators and by examining and testing these specimens as specified in Section 4 of
this guidance. The acceptance criteria should consist of demonstrating that the dominant degradation mechanism
affecting the burst and leakage properties of the tube is axially oriented ODSCC. In addition, results of inservice
inspections with motorized rotating pancake coil (MRPC) probes should be evaluated in accordance with Section 3.b
of this guidance to confirm the absence of detectable crack-like circumferential indications and detectable ODSCC
indications extending outside the tube support plate thickness. 



1.b&blank;Exclusion of Intersections 



The voltage repair criteria of this guidance do not apply to intersections meeting the criteria discussed below:




1.b.1&blank;The repair criteria do not apply to support plate intersections where the tubes may potentially collapse
or deform following a postulated loss-of-coolant accident plus safe shutdown earthquake event (e.g., intersections
located near the wedge supports at the upper tube support plates). Licensees should perform or reference an analysis
that identifies which intersections are to be excluded. 

1.b.2&blank;The repair criteria do not apply to tubes support plate intersections having dent signals greater than
5 volts as measured with the bobbin probe. 

1.b.3&blank;The repair criteria do not apply to intersections where there are mixed residuals of sufficient magnitude
to cause a 1-volt ODSCC indication (as measured with a bobbin probe) to be missed or misread. 

1.b.4&blank;The repair criteria do not apply to the tube-to-flow distribution baffle plate intersections. 



2. Tube Integrity Evaluation 



Licensees should perform an evaluation prior to plant restart to confirm that the steam generator tubes will retain
adequate structural and leakage integrity until the next scheduled inspection. The first portion of this evaluation,
referred to as the conditional burst probability calculation, assesses the voltage distribution left in service
against a threshold value of 1&times;10

^2

 probability of rupture under postulated main steam line break (MSLB) conditions. The conditional burst probability
calculation is intended to provide a conservative assessment of tube structural integrity during a postulated MSLB
occurring at end-of-cycle

2

 (EOC). It is used to determine whether the NRC needs to focus additional attention on the particular voltage repair
limit application. If the calculated conditional burst probability exceeds 1&times;10

^2

, the licensee should notify the NRC per the guidance provided in Section 6 of this guidance.

For the purposes of this guidance, ``cycle'' refers to the operating cycle between two scheduled steam generator
inspections. Operating cycle and inspection cycle are used interchangeably.

<TEXT>
 

The second portion of the tube integrity evaluation is intended to assure that total leak rate from the affected steam
generator (SG) during a postulated MSLB occurring at EOC would be less than that which could lead to radiological releases
in excess of the licensing basis for the plant. If calculated leakage exceeds the allowable limit determined by the
licensing basis dose calculation, licensees can either repair tubes, beginning with the largest voltage indications
until the leak limit is met, or reduce reactor coolant system specific iodine activity (refer to example technical
specification (TS) pages of Enclosure 2). The analyses discussed above may incorporate or reference previous analyses,
or portions thereof, to the extent that they continue to bound the conditions of the steam generator as determined
by inspection.
For plants in which the technical specifications do not require the pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORVs)
to be operable during power operation, these tube integrity analyses should be conducted for an assumed differential
pressure across the tube walls equal to the pressurizer safety valve set point plus 3 percent for the valve accumulation
less atmospheric pressure in faulted steam generators. For plants in which the technical specifications do require
the PORVs to be operable, the assumed differential pressure may be based on the PORV set point in lieu of the safety valve
set point with similar adjustments.


2. a&blank;Conditional Probability of Burst During MSLB


For this generic letter, the conditional probability of burst refers to the probability that the burst pressures
associated with 1 or more indications in the faulted steam generator will be less than the maximum pressure differential
associated with a postulated MSLB assumed to accur at EOC. A methodology should be submitted for NRC review and approval
for calculating this conditional burst probability. After the NRC approves a method for calculating conditional
probability of burst, licensees may reference the approved method. This methodology should involve: (1) Determining
the distribution of indications as a function of their voltage response at beginning of cycle (BOC) as discussed in
Section 2.b.1, (2) projecting this BOC distribution to an EOC voltage distribution based on consideration of voltage
growth due to defect progression between inspections as discussed in Section 2.b.2(2) and voltage measurement uncertainty
as discussed in Section 2.b.2(1), and (3) evaluating the conditional probability of burst for the projected EOC voltage
distribution using the correlation between burst pressure and voltage discussed in Section 2.a.1. The solution
methodology should account for uncertainties in voltage measurement (Section 2.b.2(1)), the distribution of potential
voltage growth rates applicable to each indication (Section 2.b.2(2)), and the distribution of potential burst
pressures as a function of voltage (Section 2.a.1). Monte Carlo simulations constitute an acceptable approach for
accounting for these various sources of uncertainty.


2.a.1&blank;Burst Pressure Versus Bobbin Voltage


An empirical model, for 7/8-inch or 3/4-inch diameter tubing as applicable, should be used to relate burst pressure
to bobbin voltage response for purposes of estimating the conditional probability of burst during a postulated MSLB.
This model should explicitly account for burst pressure uncertainty as indicated by scatter of the supporting test
data and should also account for the parametric (i.e., slope and intercept) uncertainty of the regression fit of the
data. The supporting data for 7/8-inch diameter and 3/4-inch diameter tubing should include all applicable data
consistent with the industry recommendations in letter dated April 22, 1994, to Jack Strosnider, NRC, from David
A. Steininger, EPRI, ``Exclusion of Data from Alternate Repair Criteria (ARC) Databases Associated with 7/8 inch
Tubing Exhibiting ODSCC'' (Reference 1) and letter dated June 9, 1994, to Brian Sheron, NRC, from David J. Modeen,
Nuclear Energy Institute (Reference 2) respectively, with certain exceptions. Specifically, data excluded under
criteria 2a and 2b in References 1 and 2 should not be excluded pending staff review and approval of these criteria.


2.b&blank;Total Leak Rate During MSLB


A methodology should be submitted for NRC review and approval for calculating the total primary-to-secondary leak
rate in the faulted steam generator during a postulated MSLB assumed to occur at EOC. After the NRC approves a leakage
calculation methodology, licensees may reference the approved method. This methodology involves: (1) Determining
the distribution of indications as a function of their voltage response at beginning of cycle (BOC) as discussed in
Section 2.b.1, (2) projecting this BOC distribution to an EOC voltage distribution based on consideration of voltage
growth due to defect progression between inspection as discussed in Section 2.b.2(2) and voltage measurement uncertainty
as discussed in Section 2.b.2(1), and (3) evaluating the total leak rate for the projected EOC voltage distribution
using a probability of leakage (POL) model as discussed in Section 2.b.3(1) and conditional leak rate model as discussed
in Section 2.b.3(2). The solution methodology should account for uncertainties in voltage measurement (Section
2.b.2(1)), the distribution of potential voltage growth rates applicable to each indication (Section 2.b.2(2)),
the uncertainties in the probability of leakage as a function of voltage (Section 2.b.3(1)), and the distribution
of potential conditional leak rates as a function of voltage (Section 2.b.3(2)). Monte Carlo simulations are an acceptable
method for accounting for these sources of uncertainty provided that the calculated total leak rate reflects an upper
95% quantile value. [Note: draft NUREG&hyph;1477, Section 3.3, page 3&hyph;21, presents an expression for T

l

 (i.e., working bound for total leak rate) which is based on the premise that leak rate is independent of voltage. This
expression does not account for parametric uncertainty in either the POL or conditional leak rate model. Thus, the
draft NUREG&hyph;1477 equation should not be used unless appropriate modifications are made to the equation to account
for these parametric uncertainties.]


2.b.1&blank;Distribution of Bobbin Indications as a Function of Voltage at BOC


The frequency distribution by voltage of bobbin indications actually found during inspection should be scaled upward
by a factor of 1/POD to account for non-detected cracks which can potentially leak or rupture under postulated MSLB
conditions during the next operating cycle. POD stands for probability of detection of ODSCC flaws. This adjusted
frequency distribution minus detected indications for tubes that have been plugged or repaired should constitute,
for purposes of the tube integrity analyses, the assumed frequency distribution of bobbin indications at BOC as a
function of voltage. This can also be expressed as:

becomes available.

 includes all flaw indications detected by the bobbin coil, regardless of whether these indications are confirmed
by MRPC inspection. 



2.b.2&blank;Projected End-of-Cycle (EOC) Voltage Distribution 


As discussed above, the calculation of both conditional burst probability and leakage (during a postulated MSLB)
requires the generation of the projected EOC voltage distribution. To project an EOC voltage distribution from the
BOC voltage distribution determined above, requires consideration of: (1) Eddy current voltage measurement uncertainty
and (2) the addition of voltage growth to account for defect progression. Monte Carlo techniques are an acceptable
means for sampling eddy current measurement uncertainty and the voltage growth distribution to determine the projected
EOC voltage distribution. Eddy current measurement uncertainty and voltage growth are discussed below. 



2.b.2(1)&blank;Eddy Current Voltage Measurement Uncertainty 



Uncertainty in eddy current voltage measurements stems primarily from two sources: 

(a) Voltage response variability (i.e., test repeatability error) which stems primarily from probe wear 

(b) Voltage measurement variability among data analysts (i.e., measurement repeatability error) 

Each of these uncertainties should be quantified. An acceptable characterization of these uncertainties is contained
in EPRI TR&hyph;100407, Revision 1, Draft Report August 1993, ``PWR Steam Generator Tube Repair Limits-Technical
Support Document for Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at the tube Support Plates'' (Reference 3), Sections
2.4.1, 2.4.2, and D.4.2.3, with the exception that no distribution cutoff should be applied to the voltage measurement
variability distribution. (However, the assumed 15 percent cutoff for the voltage response variability distribution
in Reference 3 is acceptable.) 



2.b.2(2)&blank;Voltage Growth Due to Defect Progression 


Potential voltage growth rates during the next inspection cycle (i.e. operating cycle between two scheduled steam
generator inspections) should be based on voltage growth rates observed during the last one or two inspection cycles.
For a given inspection, previous inspections results at tube support plate intersections currently exhibiting
a bobbin indication should be re-evaluated consistent with the date analysis guidelines in Section 3 below. In cases
where data acquisition guidelines employed during previous inspection differ from those discussed in Section 3,
adjustments to the evaluation of the previous data should be made to compensate for the difference. Voltage growth
rates should only be evaluated for those intersections where bobbin indications can be identified at tow successive
inspections. 

The distribution of observed voltage growth rates (based on the change in voltage on an intersection-to-intersection
basis) should be determined for each of the last one or two inspection cycles. When only the current or only the current
and previous inspections employed data acquisition guidelines similar to those discussed in Section 3, only the
growth rate distribution for the previous cycle should be used to estimate the voltage growth rate distribution for
the next inspection cycle. If both the two previous inspections employed such similar guidelines, the most limiting
of the two previous growth rate distributions should be used to estimate the voltage growth rate distribution for
the next inspection cycle. However, the two distributions should be combined if one or both the distributions is based
on a minimal number (i.e., &lt;200) of indications.







It is acceptable to use a statistical model fit of the observed growth rate distribution as part of the integrity analysis.
It is also acceptable that the voltage growth distribution be in terms of 

D

 volts rather than percent 

D

 volts provided the conservatism of this approach continues to be supported by operating experience. Finally, negative
growth rates should be included as zero growth rates in the assumed growth distribution.

2.b.3&blank;Calculation of Projected MSLB Leakage



Once the projected EOC voltage distribution is determined, the leakage for the postulated MSLB is calculated utilizing
the EOC voltage distribution and the use of two models: (1) The probability of leakage model and (2) the conditional
leak rate model. As previously discussed in Section 2.b, Monte Carlo techniques are an acceptable approach for accounting
for the uncertainties implicit in these models. These models are discussed below.



2.b3(1)&blank;Probability of Leakage as a Function of Voltage


The Probability of leakage (POL) model should utilize the log-logistic functional form. This model should explicitly
account for parameter uncertainty of the POL functional fit of the data (i.e., ``model fit'' uncertainty). The supporting
data sets for 2.2 cm (7/8-inch) diameter and 1.9 cm (3/4-inch) diameter tubing should include all applicable data
consistent with the industry recommendations in References 1 and 2, respectively, with certain exceptions. Namely,
data excluded under criteria 2a and 2b in References 1 and 2 should not be excluded pending staff review and approval
of these criteria.



2.b.3(2)&blank;Conditional Leakage Rate under MSLB Conditions



The conditional leak rate model should incorporate a linear regression fit to the log of the leak rate data, for 2.2
cm (7/8-inch) and 1.9 cm (3/4-inch) diameter tubing respectively, as a function of the log of the bobbin voltage and
should account for both data scatter and parameter uncertainty of the linear regression fit. Use of this approach
is subject to demonstrating that the linear regression fit is valid at the 5% level with a ``p-value'' test. If this
condition is not satisfied, the linear regression fit should be assumed to have zero slope (i.e., the linear regression
fit should be assumed to be constant with voltage).

The supporting data sets for 2.2 cm (7/8-inch) diameter and 1.9 cm (3/4-inch) diameter tubing should include all applicable
data consistent with the industry recommendations in References 1 and 2, respectively, with certain exceptions.
Specifically, data excluded under criteria 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 3c in References 1 and 2 should not be excluded pending
staff review and approval of these criteria. In addition, an MSLB leak rate of 2496 liters/hour should be utilized
for the data point obtained from V.C. Summer tube R28C41 pending staff review and approval of the revised leakage estimate
for this tube described in Reference 2.



2.b.4&blank;Calculation of Offsite and Control Room Doses



For the MSLB leak rate calculated above, offsite and control room doses should be calculated utilizing currently
accepted licensing basis assumptions. Licensees should note that Enclosure 2 of this generic letter provides example
TS pages for reducing reactor coolant system specific iodine activity limits. Reactor coolant system iodine activities
may be reduced to .35 microcuries per gram does equivalent I&hyph;131. Licensees wishing to reduce iodine activities
below this level should provide a justification supporting the request that addresses the release rate data described
in Reference 6. Reduction of reactor coolant iodine activity is an acceptable means for accepting higher projected
leakage rates and still meeting the applicable limits of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 100 utilizing
licensing basis assumptions.



3. Inspection Criteria



The inspection scope, data acquisition, and data analysis should be performed in a manner consistent with the methodology
utilized to develop the voltage limits (e.g., the methodology described in Reference 4, Appendix A, and Reference
5, Appendix A) with the exceptions and clarifications noted below.



3.a&blank;Bobbin Coil Inspection Scope and Sampling


3.a.1&blank;The bobbin coil inspection should include 100 percent of the hot-leg TSP intersections and cold-leg
intersections down to the lowest cold-leg TSP with known ODSCC. The determination of TSPs having ODSCC should be based
on the performance of at least a 20 percent random sampling of tubes inspected over their full length.



3.b&blank;Motorized Rotating Pancake Coil (MRPC) Inspection



MRPC
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 inspections should be conducted as given below for purposes of obtaining additional characterization of ODSCC flaws
found with the bobbin probe and to inspect intersections with significant bobbin interference signals (due to copper,
dents, large mix residuals) which may impair the detectability of ODSCC with the bobbin probe or which may unduly influence
the bobbin voltage measurement. With respect to ODSCC flaw characterization, a key purpose of the MRPC inspections
is to ensure the absence of detectable crack-like circumferential indications and detectable indications extending
outside the thickness of the tube support plate. The voltage-based repair criteria are not applicable to intersections
exhibiting such indications, and special reporting requirements pertaining to the finding of such indications
are described in Section 6.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
For the purposes of this guidance, MRPC also includes the use of comparable or improved nondestructive examination
techniques.

</FOOTNOTE>


3.b.1&blank;MRPC inspection should be performed for all indications exceeding 1.5 volts as measured by bobbin coil
for 2.2 cm [7/8-inch] diameter tubes or 1.0 volt as measured by bobbin coil for 1.9 cm [7/8-inch] diameter tubes.

3.b.2&blank;The voltage-based criteria of this guidance are not applicable to intersections with copper deposits,
dent signals greater than 5 volts, and large mixed residuals.

3.b.3&blank;All intersections with bobbin coil signals indicative of copper deposits should be inspected with
MRPC. Any indications found at such intersections with MRPC should cause the tube to be repaired.

3.b.4&blank;All intersections with dent signals greater than 5 volts should be inspected with MRPC. Any indications
found at such intersections with MRPC should cause the tube to be repaired.

3.b.5&blank;All intersections with large mixed residuals should be inspected with MRPC. For purposes of this guidance,
large mixed residuals are those that could cause a 1-volt bobbin signal to be missed or misread. Any indications found
at such intersections with MRPC should cause the tube to be repaired.

<PARENT> FR940812-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3.b.6&blank;A minimum sample of 100 intersections should be inspected with MRPC to meet the criteria of this part.


3.c&blank;Data Acquisition and Analysis


3.c.1&blank;The bobbin coil calibration standard should be calibrated against the reference standard used in the
laboratory as part of the development of the voltage-based approach by direct testing or through use of a transfer
standard.
3.c.2&blank;Bobbin coil probes should be calibrated based on four 100 percent through-wall holes.
3.c.3&blank;Once the probe has been calibrated on the 100 percent through-wall hole, the voltage response of new
bobbin coil probes for the 20 percent to 80 percent American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) through-wall
holes should not differ from the nominal voltage by more than +/^10 percent.
3.c.4&blank;Probe wear should be controlled by either an inline measurement device or through the use of a periodic
wear measurement. When utilizing the periodic wear measurement approach, if a probe is found to be out-of-specification,
all tubes inspected since the last successful calibration should be reinspected with the new calibrated probe.
3.c.5&blank;Data analysts should be trained and qualified in the use of the analyst's guidelines and procedures.
Data analyst performance should be consistent with the assumptions for analyst measurement variability (Section
2.b.2(1)) utilized in the tube integrity evaluation (Section 2).
3.c.6&blank;Quantitative noise criteria (resulting from electrical noise, tube noise, calibration standard
noise) should be included in the data analysis procedures. Data failing to meet these criteria should be rejected,
and the tube reinspected.
3.c.7&blank;Data analysts should review the mixed residuals on the standard itself and take action as necessary
to minimize these residuals.
3.c.8&blank;Smaller diameter probes can be used to inspect tubes where it is impractical to utilize a full-sized
probe provided that the probes and procedures have been demonstrated on a statistically significant basis to give
an equivalent voltage response and detection capability when compared to the full size probe. This demonstration
can be done on a plant-specific or generic basis.


4. Tube Removal and Examination/Testing


Implementation of voltage-based plugging criteria should include a program of tube removals for testing and examination
as described below. The purpose of this program is to confirm axial ODSCC as the dominant degradation mechanism as
discussed in Section 1.a and to provide additional data to enhance the burst pressure, probability of leakage, and
conditional leak rate correlations described in Sections 2.a.1, 2.b.3(1), and 2.b.3(2), respectively.


4.a&blank;Number and Frequency of Tube Pulls


Pulled tube specimens for at least six tube support plate intersections should be obtained for each plant either during
the plant steam generator inspection outage that implements the voltage repair limits or during the inspection outage
preceding initial application of voltage-based repair criteria. Additional pulled tube specimens should be obtained
periodically after the initial application of voltage-based plugging criteria on a frequency of six tube intersections
every two steam generator inspections outages. In some cases, it may be necessary for the staff to request plant specific
tube pulls due to special circumstances involved with a particular plant specific application of the voltage-based
repair limits.
Alternatively, the request to acquire pulled tube specimens may be met by participating in an industry sponsored
tube pull program endorsed by the NRC that meets the objectives of this guidance. Such a program would have to satisfy
the following objectives: (1) To confirm the degradation mechanism for plants utilizing the generic letter for the
first time, (2) to continue monitoring the ODSCC mechanism over time, and (3) to enhance the burst pressure, probability
of leakage, and conditional leak rate correlations. [Note; the industry has proposed such a program in letter dated
May 10, 1994, to Brian Sheron, NRC, from David J. Modeen, Nuclear Energy Institute (Reference 5), which is currently
under NRC staff review.]


4.b&blank;Selection Criteria


Selection of tube pulls should consider the following criteria:
4.b.1&blank;There should be an emphasis on removing tube intersections with large voltage indications.
4.b.2&blank;Where possible the removed tube intersections should cover a range of voltages, including intersections
with no detectable degradation.
4.b.3&blank;As a minimum, selected intersections should be such as to ensure that the total data set includes at least
a representative number of intersections with MRPC signatures indicative of a single dominant crack as compared
to intersections with MRPC signatures indicative of two or more dominant cracks about the circumference.


4.c&blank;Examination and Testing


Removed tube intersections should be subjected to leak and burst tests under simulated MSLB conditions to confirm
that the failure mode and leakage rates are consistent with that assumed in development of the voltage-based criteria.
In addition, these data may be used to enhance the supporting data sets for the burst pressure and leakage correlations
subject to NRC review and approval as stated in 4.d, below. Subsequent to burst testing, the intersections should
be destructively examined to confirm that the degradation morphology is consistent with the assumed morphology
for ODSCC.


4.d&blank;General Criteria for Burst and Leakage Models and Supporting Test Data


This guidance allows only the use of NRC approved burst and leakage models and correlations; this includes NRC approval
of the data that supports the models and correlations.

5. Operational Leakage Limits



5.a&blank;The operational leakage limit should be reduced to 150 gallons per day (gpd) through each steam generator.

5.b&blank;Licensees should review their leakage monitoring measures to ensure that should a significant leak be
experienced in service, it will be detected and the plant shut down in a timely manner to reduce the likelihood of a potential
rupture. Specifically, the effectiveness of these procedures for ensuring the timely detection, trending, and
response to rapidly increasing leaks should be assessed. This should include consideration of the appropriateness
of alarm set points on the primary-to-secondary leakage detection instrumentation and the various criteria for
operator actions in response to detected leakage.

5.c&blank;Steam generator tubes with known leaks should be repaired prior to returning the steam generators to service
following a steam generator inspection outage.



6. Reporting Requirements



6.a&blank;Threshold Criteria for Requiring Prior Staff Approval To Continue With Voltage-Based Criteria




This guidance allows licensees to implement the voltage-based repair criteria on a continuing basis after the NRC
staff has approved the initial TS amendment. However, there are several situations for which the NRC staff must receive
prior notification before a licensee can continue with the implemtation of the voltage-based repair criteria:

6.a.1&blank;If the actual measured voltage distribution would have resulted in an estimated leakage during the
previous operating cycle greater than the leakage limit (determined from the licensing basis calculation), then
the licensee should notify the NRC of this occurrence and provide an assessment of its significance prior to returning
the steam generators to service.

6.a.2&blank;If (1) indications are identified that extend beyond the confines of the TSP or (2) indications are identified
that appear to be circumferential in nature, then the NRC staff should be notified prior to returning the steam generators
to service.

6.a.3&blank;If the calculated conditional probability of burst based on the projected EOC voltage distribution
exceeds 1X10

-2

, licensees should notify NRC and provide an assessment of the significance of this occurrence prior to returning
the steam generators to service. This assessment should address the safety significance of the calculated conditional
probability.



6.b&blank;Information To Be Provided Following Each Restart



The following information should be submitted to the NRC staff within 90 days of each restart following a steam generator
inspection:

(a) The results of metallurgical examinations performed for tube intersections removed from the steam generator.

(b) The following distributions should be provided in both tabular and graphical form. This information is to enable
the staff to assess the effectiveness of the methodology, determine whether the degradation is changing significantly,
determine whether the data supports higher voltage repair limits, and to perform confirmatory calculations:

(i) EOC voltage distribution_all indications found during the inspection regardless of MRPC confirmation

(ii) Cycle voltage growth rate distribution (i.e., from BOC to EOC)

(iii) Voltage distribution for EOC repaired indications_distribution of indications presented in (i) above that
were repaired (i.e., plugged or sleeved)

(iv) Voltage distribution for indications left in service at the beginning of the next operating cycle regardless
of MRPC confirmation_obtained from (i) and (iii) above

(v) Voltage distribution for indications left in service at the beginning of the next operating cycle that were confirmed
by MRPC to be crack-like or not MRPC inspected

(vi) Non-destructive examination uncertainty distribution used in predicting the EOC (for the next cycle of operation)
voltage distribution

(c) The results of the tube integrity evaluation described in Section 2. Note that these calculations must be completed
prior to restart to ensure that an adequate number of tubes have been repaired to meet the leakage limit and ensure continued
tube integrity.

d. Implementation of the steam generator tube/tube support plate plugging criteria requires a 100 percent bobbin
coil inspection for hot-leg tube support plate intersections and cold-leg intersections down to the lowest cold-leg
tube support plate with known outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) indications. The determination
of tube support plate intersections having ODSCC indications shall be based on the performance of at least a 20 percent

means the imperfection depth at or beyond which the tube shall be removed from service and is equal to 40 percent of the
nominal wall thickness. 

This definition does not apply to tube support plate intersections for which the voltage-based plugging criteria
are being applied. Refer to 4.4.5.4.a.10 for the plugging limit applicable to these intersections.

10. Tube Support Plate Plugging Limit is used for the disposition of a steam generator tube for continued service that
is experiencing outside diameter stress corrosion cracking confined within the thickness of the tube support plates.
At tube support plate intersections, the repair limit is based on maintaining steam generator tube serviceability
as described below:
a. Degradation attributed to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking within the bounds of the tube support plate
with bobbin voltage less than or equal to [Note 1] will be allowed to remain in service.
b. Degradation attributed to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking within the bounds of the tube support plate
with a bobbin voltage greater than [Note 1] will be repaired or plugged except as noted in 4.4.5.4.a.10.c below.
c. Indications of potential degradation attributed to outside diameter stress corrosion cracking within the bounds
of the tube support plate with a bobbin voltage greater than [Note 1] but less than or equal to [Note 2] may remain in service
if a rotating pancake coil inspection does not detect degradation. Indications of outside diameter stress corrosion
cracking degradation with a bobbin voltage greater than [Note 2] volts will be plugged or repaired.
d. [If applicable] Certain intersections as identified in [reference report] will be excluded from application
of the voltage-based repair criteria as it is determined that these intersections may collapse or deform following
a postulated LOCA + SSE event.
e. If a result of leakage due to a mechanism other than ODSCC at the tube support plate intersection, or some other cause,
an unscheduled mid-cycle inspection is performed, the following repair criteria apply instead of 4.4.5.4.10.c.
If bobbin voltage is within expected limits, the indication can remain in service. The expected bobbin voltage limits

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;400]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power &amp; Light Co.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Carolina Power &amp; Light Company
(the licensee) to withdraw its August 6, 1992 application for proposed amendment, as supplemented September 15,
1993, to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;63 for the Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, located in
Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina.

The proposed amendment would have revised Section 6 of the Technical Specifications to implement the functional
role and responsibilities of the Nuclear Assessment Department (NAD). The NAD performs internal evaluations and
assessment activities. The proposed change would have modified the facility Technical Specifications pertaining
to the NAD. The fundamental role of the NAD is to assist in the early identification of deficiencies that may prevent
the company's nuclear projects from achieving the desired level of performance on a sustained basis and to ensure
effective correction of deficiencies. Because of major changes in the original submittal, the licensee has chosen
to withdraw the previous amendment application and provide a new amendment request.

The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 16, 1992 (57 FR 42770). However, by letter dated July 22, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated August 6, 1992, as supplemented
September 15, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated July 22, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment.
The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh, North Carolina

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service requests comments on the issuance of a haze value guideline for glassine envelope window-covering

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Postal Service automation-compatibility standards for envelope window-covering material focus on a measurement
that combines the window material's transparency and the print quality of the address or barcode that appears behind
it. Measuring the transparency and the print quality in concert provides the most relevant data to determine whether
Postal Service automated sorting equipment will be capable of successfully reading the address and/or barcode during
processing. Thus, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for letter-size mail in automation-rate mailings require
that addresses viewed through a glassine window covering must provide a print contrast ratio (PCR) of at least 45 percent
and that barcodes viewed through the material must provide a print reflectance difference (PRD) of at least 30 percent.
(These percentages pertain to both the red and the green portions of the optical spectrum, when measured using a USPS
or USPS-licensed envelope reflectance meter.) 


Although these readability standards identify useful performance criteria for window-covering material, some
glassine manufacturers have complained that it is difficult to translate them into production criteria for their
products. It is impractical for glassine manufacturers to know, in advance of production, the quality of the printing
that will show through the window of an envelope using their product, yet this information becomes critical in determining
whether the material meets USPS automation-compatibility specification. 
Accordingly, to help glassine manufacturers establish appropriate criteria for the glassine itself in isolation
from the printing that will be used with it, the Postal Service conducted a series of laboratory and operational tests
on a variety of materials. 
The laboratory test method used was the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 1003, Standard Test Method
for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics. Test measurements were taken with a MacBeth Color-Eye
7000 Spectrophotometer and Optiview software set for correlated haze. Environmental conditions, material thickness,
dimensional stability, gloss, and haze were carefully measured and monitored during testing on both the Postal Service
multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) version A and the wide area barcode reader (WABCR). (A detailed description
of testing methods and criteria is available on request.) 
As a result of these tests, the Postal Service proposes that glassine window-covering material be evaluated for automation
compatibility by measuring its haze value. Correlated (transmitted) haze is defined as the percentage of transmitted
light that deviates from the incident beam by forward scattering when passing through a specimen. Any specimen with
a haze value greater than 30 percent, when tested in accordance with ASTM D 1003 is considered diffusing or translucent.
This can affect readability on the OCR or WABCR by diffusing the image of the printed insert as read through the window-covering
material.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940812-2-00198 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940812-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Most plastic window-covering materials evaluated in these tests were considered to be nondiffusing or transparent
materials and exhibited hazes in the range of 1 to 25 percent. All glassines tested were considered to be diffusing
or translucent materials and exhibited haze values from 64 to 97 percent. Although readability was significantly
affected by the quality of the printing on the inserts as well as the spacing between the glassine and the printed insert,
those materials that measured no more than a 70-percent correlated haze performed best. 
In accordance with these results, the Postal Service proposes recommending, as a general guideline, that glassine
when used to cover the windows of mailpieces intended for automation-based rates, have a correlated haze value of
no greater than 70 percent (using ASTM D 1003, standard test criteria). This proposed guideline is intended specifically
for manufacturers to aid in the production of glassine window-covering materials capable of satisfying Postal Service
automation-compatibility requirements. 

It will not affect the application of the current standards for print contrast ratio or print reflectance difference
because those remain the relevant measurements when evaluating the ability of Postal Service automated sorting
equipment to read an address or barcode appearing through a window covering. Accordingly, in some cases a mailpiece
may be determined not to qualify for automation-based rates based on failure to meet the PCR or PRD standard, even though
the glassine measured alone would comply with the haze value guideline. 
Mailers concerned about the acceptability of their mailpieces should note that Postal Service mailpiece design
analysts are equipped to assist customers in determining whether their envelopes meet PCR or PRD standards but are
not equipped to evaluate correlated haze. 
The Postal Service does not intend to publish this guideline in the Domestic Mail Manual. Because this guideline is
intended primarily for the small number of manufacturers that produce glassine and will not affect rate eligibility,
it does not appear that wide dissemination will be necessary. Instead, the Postal Service plans to issue the guideline
in a Customer Support Ruling (CSR). CSRs were created to assist postal personnel and customers with interpreting,
clarifying, and applying the meaning of the standards contained in the DMM. The rulings are intended to be used in conjunction
with the DMM standards. These rulings are issued by the Manager, Business Mail Acceptance, U.S. Postal Service, Washington,
DC. Mailers can request copies of rulings that specifically address certain topics through a local Postal Service
manager of business mail entry. In addition, the final standard would be incorporated in a future issue of Postal Service
Publication 25, Designing Business Letter Mail. 
Interested parties are invited to comment on the proposed guideline as well as the proposed means for its issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Amend
and Extend the Pilot Program on the Exchange Relating to the Preferencing of Public Orders by Approved Dealers and
Other Proprietary Members</DOCTITLE>



August 5, 1994.



I. Introduction


On June 24, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to extend through May 18, 1995, its pilot program which governs preferenced trading. The Commission
originally approved this pilot on February 7, 1991.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In connection with this extension of the pilot, the Exchange has proposed certain changes to its rules.

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1994.

</FOOTNAME>
While no comments were received in response to this proposal, in response to the Boston Stock Exchange's Competing
Specialist program several SROs expressed views regarding the CSR Preferencing program as structured at that time.
Concerns raised included: reduced incentive to place agency limit orders on the CSE due to high costs; immediate execution
of agency at-the-market and marketable limit orders on CSE at the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') BBO without
an opportunity for price improvement; and the failure of CSE preferencing dealers to place their limit orders on the
CSE book.
</FOOTNOTE>


II. Description



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend and extend the existing pilot program of the Exchange relating to
the preferencing of public agency market and marketable limit orders by approved dealers and other proprietary members.
The Commission originally approved the pilot in February, 1991,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and subsequently extended the pilot several times.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The current approval expires August 6, 1994. The Commission's staff requested that the Exchange seek a limited extension
to coincide with the recently approved Boston Stock Exchange's (``BSE'') competing specialist pilot program
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 so that the Commission can consolidate its future review of the preferencing programs of the various exchanges.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission recently approved a CSE proposal implementing information barrier procedures for Designated Dealers
(``DDs''). 

See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No 34449 (July 27, 1994). The term ``Designated Dealer'' means a Proprietary Member
who maintains a minimum net capital amount and who has been approved by the Securities Committee to perform market
functions by entering bids and offers for Designated Issues into the system. 

See 

CSE Rule 11.9 (a)(3). The DD status obligates the dealer to guarantee execution of all public agency market orders
and agency limit orders up to 2,099 shares.
</FOOTNOTE>


The CSE preferencing program allows market makers that meet certain qualifications to interact with their own order
flow with respect to those orders as long as the individual market maker satisfies, among other things, best execution
and other obligations designed to protect customers.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The rule is intended to provide market makers with the ability to retain and execute their internal order flow at the
national best bid or offer (``NBBO''), provided the public limit orders on the book at that price have been executed.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
10

</FOOTNAME>
For a description of the CSE Preferencing program, 

see supra, 

note 3: 

See also 

CSE Rule 11.9 (l), (m), and (u). The CSE is totally automated and utilizes a competing market maker system. Its members
transmit orders, make markets, receive instant executions and reports through remote terminals or computer interfaces
from around the country. The limit order book is open on the CSE and a market maker or broker must display his best interest
if he or she wants to trade.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>
In a 1990 letter, the CSE wrote:
[a]t all times, the CSE market makers and brokers are subject to being ``hit'' by brokers representing public orders
or by professionals on or off exchange floors. In addition, public orders are guaranteed executions at the NBBO for
up to 2099 shares, and market makers often display sizes in excess of that number which are subject to be taken at the
literal flick of a switch. No other exchange trader, whether he be a market maker or specialist, is so exposed or out
on an electronic limb. We believe that the preferencing rule makes a small dent in this electronic competitive disadvantage
and will encourage well-capitalized market makers to learn the system and ultimately to provide deeper electronic
makers.


See 

letter from Frederick Moss, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, CSE, to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market
Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, dated November 14, 1990.
</FOOTNOTE>


The proposal amends CSE rules, effective through May 18, 1995.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 As part of a recent analysis of its preferencing program, the Exchange has reviewed the Division of Market Regulation's
(``Division'') five recommendations in 

Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments 

which are directed toward all market makers in listed stocks, including third market makers and firms internalizing
order flow.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange, as a result, proposes to codify the Division's recommendations by amending or clarifying current CSE
Rules.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
12

</FOOTNAME>
In approving the initial pilot, the CSE agreed to several limitations or requirements, which will continue to apply.
These conditions limit the number of issues (350) in which a preferencing dealer may be registered; require the Exchange
to provide certain information to the Commission; prohibit preferenced trading for index arbitrage purposes when
``circuit breakers'' are in effect; and prohibit the preferencing of any order which the preferencing dealer has
purchased from the customer for a direct cash payment.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 

Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (``Market 2000''), 

Study III, p. 14 (Jan. 1994).
</FOOTNOTE>


First, the Exchange proposes to add interpretive language to CSE Rule 12.10, the Exchange's ``best execution'' rule
requiring members, as part of their Fiduciary obligation to provide best execution for their customers' orders.
This new obligation requires a member to expose to the national market system all or a representative portion of any
limit order which is priced either 

on or between 

the NBBO, unless (1) the order is immediately executed, or (2) the customer expressly requests that the order not be
exposed.
Second, the CSE is concerned that dealers should not trade ahead of customer limit orders. CSE rule 12.6 currently
provides that no member may buy or sell a security for its own account when it holds an unexecuted customer market or
like-priced limit order in that security.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In order to encourage all members to place public agency limit orders on the CSE book, the Exchange proposes to amend
CSE Rule 11.10(e) to eliminate the transaction charge on public agency limit orders.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
14

</FOOTNAME>
One way for members to comply with this requirement would be to place their customer limit orders on the CSE limit order
book.
</FOOTNOTE>


Third, the CSE is proposing to codify that if a dealer holds a customer buy order and a customer sell order that can be
crossed, the dealer should cross those orders without interposing itself as dealer. While the CSE maintains that
it historically has interpreted its Rule 12.6 to require the crossing of like-priced customer buy and sell orders,
to remove any doubt, the CSE proposes to make that requirement explicit.
Fourth, the Exchange proposes to codify that dealers should establish and adhere to fixed standards for queuing and
executing customer orders. This will facilitate CSE enforcement of standards to maintain the integrity of its market.
Fifth, consistent with the ITS trade-through and block policies, dealers will continue to be prohibited from trading
at a price outside the ITS BBO without satisfying the market interest at the price.
Finally, in order to gauge the impact of the preferencing program on the CSE and on the national market system, the Exchange
has agreed to provide the Commission with quarterly reports similar to those required of the BSE as part of its competing
specialist pilot. These reports will provide the following information:

<PARENT> FR940812-2-00072 </PARENT>

(1) A list indicating how many preferencing DDs are on the exchange and the issues in which they make markets.
(2) The volume of preferenced trades and shares and the percentage of total CSE trade and share volume that preferenced
activity represents.
(3) The CSE's volume attributable to ITS commitments sent by other ITS participants and the percentage of such commitments
in issues which have preferencing specialists.
(4) The number of preferenced order effected against the National Securities Trading System (``NSTS'') limit order
book.
(5) The percentage of time that the CSE improves and/or matches the NBBO, and the percentage of time that the CSE achieves
price improvement for customer orders when the spread is wider than 
<FOOTCITE>1/8</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>th point.</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
15

</FOOTNAME>
Although the BSE is not currently required to provide NBBO and price improvement data, the CSE is offering to provide
this additional data because it believes that this would be helpful to the Commission in accurately assessing the
contributions of preferencing to the national market system. The Commission, however, intends to generate the necessary
data to facilitate adequate comparison of all NBBO data.
</FOOTNOTE>


(6) The CSE's share of Consolidated Tape trade reports, as compared to its share on the date of this extension.


III. Discussion


In its recent order approving the BSE's Competing Specialist proposal, the Commission articulated views and concerns
regarding exchange proposals that modify traditional auction market priority rules in favor of certain members
over others. The Commission is concerned about the implications of the preferencing feature and its effect on quote
competition and the risk of market fragmentation through increased internalization of order flow. The Commission
holds by its views in that order, and is approving the CSE proposal to extend the expiration date of the CSE perferencing
program until May 18, 1995, the same date that the BSE's Competing Specialist pilot expires. During this time the CSE
will monitor the pilot, collect data, and submit reports as outlined below.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
16

</FOOTNAME>
The CSE is expected to monitor its pilot and provide the Commission with a report on its operation detailing how the
proposal has affected the quality of CSE's market, including its effect on quote competition and market transparency.
The Commission expects the CSE to demonstrate, through periodic reporting requirements outlined above and other
data as the Exchange may wish to generate, that there are in fact beneficial competitive effects from the preferencing
program. Specifically, the Commission expects the Exchange to analyze the effects of the program on the quality of
market making by CSE DDs as a result of the enhancements/changes adopted herein. If, for any reason, the CSE cannot
provide such an analysis, the Commission would have serious reservations about continuing the preferencing program.
</FOOTNOTE>


While the CSE amended the DD program following the BSE approval, the Commission continues to be concerned about changes
in priority principles, Implicitly, the CSE argues that failure to provide time priority in a market place whose structure
includes multiple market makers need not be inconsistent with the Act if two primary conditions are met. First, market
makers protect customer limit orders consistent with the requirements and goals of the Act. This requires that the
Exchange establish and enforce specific practices and standards for its members participating in the preferencing
program to further the goals of investor protection. Second, the Exchange program contributes meaningfully to the
national market system by narrowing the spread between the NBBO.
While the CSE continues to alter its priority rules, it has taken other substantive steps to address the Division's
concerns outlined in Study III of 

Market 2000 

regarding minimum order handling principles to ensure that customers are treated fairly. The current proposal enhances
customer protection by clarifying CSE Rules regarding best execution responsibilities, customer priority, and
the mandatory crossing of customer orders whenever possible. Specifically, the CSE proposal not only requires as
part of a members' ``best execution'' responsibilities the display of all or a representative portion of customer
limit orders that are better than the ITS BBO,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 but further requires the display of those same orders that are 

at 

the ITS BBO unless the customer expressly requests that the order not be exposed or unless the order is immediately
executed.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The Division has stated its belief that this requirement will result in tighter spreads, provide a more accurate picture
of trading interests, and contribute to improved price discovery.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
17

</FOOTNAME>
When determining the amount of a limit order to expose, a broker, as part of its fiduciary duties, is charged with ensuring
the best execution of a customer's order.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
18

</FOOTNAME>
This proposed additional requirement also addresses concerns raised by various SROs in the context of the BSE Competing
Specialist proposal that limit orders on the CSE are immediately executed at the ITS BBO without the opportunity for
price improvement.
The Commission wishes to clarify that as part of the CSE's customer priority rule 12.6, a member is obligated to execute
a customer's limit order immediately upon a likepriced proprietary execution on any other market. Further, if a CSE
market maker determines to route a customer limit order to another firm or exchange, the limit order will nevertheless
be viewed as ``held'' by the market maker. Thus, the CSE market maker could not trade ahead of a customer limit order
that it forwarded to another firm or exchange.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
19

</FOOTNAME>


See Market 2000, 

Study IV, p. 6.
</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange also has taken steps to encourage and protect customer limit orders by eliminating transaction charges
on public agency limit orders and by clarifying that, under its customer priority rule, a member may hot buy or sell
for its own account when it holds an unexecuted customer market or like-priced limit order in that security. Moreover,
the commitment by CSE in requiring members to expose all of a representative portion of customer limit orders to the
entire ITS market addresses commentator's allegations that CSE preferencing dealers do not place their limit orders
on the CSE book, but rather hold the orders ``upstairs'' until the orders become marketable, and thus disadvantage
their customer. Under the current proposal, even if a limit order is not placed on the CSE book, a member is required,
unless instructed otherwise by a customer, to expose all or part of that limit order to the market thereby ensuring
the customer order is exposed, eligible for price improvement, and adds to overall transparency of the marketplace.
The CSE has represented that it will enforce specific practices and standards for its members participating in the
preferencing program and the Commission expects quarterly data from the Exchange as well as a final report analyzing
the effects of the program on the quality of market making by CSE DDs.
Based on the above, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow the CSE to extend, as amended, its preferencing
pilot until May 18, 1995. In making this determination, the Commission has carefully considered the potential benefits
from the proposed enhancements, such as better quotes, as well as the potential adverse effects of the proposal, such
as the possibility of increased internalization of order flow. The Commission believes that the CSE has incorporated
features in its proposal, consistent with the Division's recommendations in 

Market 2000, 

to allow it to implement on a temporary basis, an amended preferencing program. 
The Commission, nevertheless, believes that before the CSE proposal may be extended beyond May 18, 1995, or approved
on a permanent basis, the CSE must demonstrate that its proposal resulted in added depth and liquidity to its market
and improved quotations.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 If this showing cannot be made, the Commission would not be inclined to extend the preferencing program. Accordingly,
the Commission requests that the CSE provide the information it has agreed to furnish to the Commission,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 on a quarterly basis. Further, we request the Exchange to submit a report to the Commission, discussing and analyzing
the data outlined above, by January 18, 1995.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The report should discuss data in terms of the effects of the preferencing pilot on the quality of the CSE market with
respect to depth, liquidity, and quote improvement.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
23

</FOOTNAME>
As noted in the BSE approval, should any other exchange attempt to implement a similar system that is acceptable to
the Commission, the pilot period would be limited to the time period afforded the BSE. As a result all preferencing
programs will expire May 18, 1995. At the end of this period, all systems will be subject to the same scrutiny regardless
of how long they may have been in operation.
</FOOTNOTE>


IV. Conclusion 


The Commission finds that temporary approval of the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with
the requirements of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) because it is designed to
promote just and equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open
market and a national market system.

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Description of the Proposal



The Amex has developed a new index called the Mexico Index, based entirely on the value of shares or related American
Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') of widely held Mexican companies traded on the NYSE, Amex, or that are National Market
(``NM'') securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system
(``NASDAQ''). The Index contains securities of highly-capitalized companies with major business interests in
Mexico. The Exchange states that these companies have been drawn from a variety of industries, including construction,
telecommunications, banking, shipping, tobacco, media, and food and beverage, to reflect the diversity of the Mexican
market.



Index Calculation and Maintenance



The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. In an attempt to more closely approximate
the industry weightings within the Mexico stock market, the two highest capitalized components within the Index
are given higher weightings, 24% and 12%, respectively, while the eight remaining Index components are weighted
equally at 8%. Accordingly, as of the market close on June 17, 1994, a portfolio of ten Mexican component securities
was established representing a hypothetical investment (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $24,000 in the largest
capitalized component in the Index, $12,000 in the second largest, and $8,000 in each of the remaining Index components.
The value of the Index equals the current market value (

i.e., 

based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided
by the Index divisor. The Index divisor has been established to yield the benchmark value of 175.00 at the close of trading
on July 22, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
8

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Letter from Howard A. Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative
Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1994. The Amex initially proposed to utilize a divisor calculated to yield
the value of 231.00 at the close of trading on June 17, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June, September and December,
the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index portfolio adjusted by
changing the number of whole shares of each component so that the largest capitalized Index component once again represents
24% of the Index value, the second largest component represents 12%, and each of the remaining components represent
8%. If the number of components in the Index increases to greater than ten, the Amex will continue to weight the two components
with the highest market capitalizations 24% and 12%, respectively. The remaining components will then be weighted
equally.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the two securities with the highest market capitalizations
will be assigned a 24% and 12% weighting, respectively, while the remaining ten Index components will be assigned
a 6.4% weighting.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
9

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Amendment No. 3.

</FOOTNOTE>


If it becomes necessary to remove an Index component, the exchange will either add an Index component having characteristics
that will permit the Index to remain within the maintenance criteria specified in the Generic Narrow-Based Index
Approval Order (and also contained in exchange Rule 901C),
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 or will permit the Index to be calculated based upon the remaining components (but no fewer than nine) until the next
quarterly rebalancing, at which time the Exchange will replace the component so that the Index will continue to have
at least ten components.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows
an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio. If necessary, a divisor
adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes
the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment.

See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (``Generic Narrow Based Index
Approval Order'').


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Amendment No. 3.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Amex states that it has routine experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and
has not encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely,
proper, and adequate notice is given to market participants. Particularly, an information circular is distributed
to all Exchange members notifying them of the quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's
contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars,
and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional
and marketing materials for the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology.

As noted above, the number of shares of each component in the Index portfolio remain fixed between quarterly reviews
except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary cash
dividend, a stock distribution, stock splits, reverse stock splits, rights offering distribution, reorganization,
recapitalization, or 
similar event with respect to the Index component securities. In 
a merger or consolidation of an issuer of an Index component, if 
the component remains in the Index, the number of shares of that 
component in the Index portfolio may be adjusted, to the nearest 
whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the 
Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. 
Further, if the Exchange replaces an Index component at a time 
other than at a quarterly rebalancing, it will do so in the 
following manner: if one of the two highest weighted Index 
components is replaced, the Exchange will determined the weighting 
of the Index component being replaced and assign the same 
weighting to the newly added component. If one of the equally 
weighted Index components is replaced, the average dollar value 
of the remaining Index components within that tier will be 
calculated and the resulting figure used to determine the 
assigned Index portfolio shares, to the nearest whole share. In 





 all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure 
Index continuity, and the Index will be rebalanced at the next regularly scheduled rebalancing.

See 

Letter from Nathan Most, Senior Vice President, New Products Development, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative
Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1994, This Letter also withdraws that portion of Amendment No. 3 as it relates
to the replacement of Index components. 




</FOOTNOTE>



The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index and, pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 901C(b), may at any time or from time to time 
substitute Index component securities, or adjust the number of components included in the Index, based on changing
conditions in 
Mexico. However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of 
Index components to greater than nine or increase the number of components to greater than thirteen without prior
Commission approval.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Amendment No. 3. 



</FOOTNOTE>



The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and 
disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape 
Association's Network B. 





Expiration and Settlement 




The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style 
Index options (

i.e.,

 exercises are permitted at expiration only). 
The Exchange also proposes that Mexico Index options will have 
trading hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. EST. As with other 
index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will 
expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the 



 expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series will normally be the second to
last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally a Thursday).
Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. 


The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Mexico Index option will be calculated based upon the primary exchange
regular way opening sale prices for the Index component securities. In the case of NM securities, the first reported
sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component securities, its opening sale price is used
to calculate the Index settlement value. The Index settlement value can be determined once all of the components have
opened. If any of the components do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's
last sale price is used in the Index settlement value calculation. 



The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calender months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval
between expiration months 



 for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months. 




Eligibility and Maintenance Standards for Index Components 






The Exchange has represented that it will ensure that the Index initially and thereafter satisfies the initial listing
and maintenance criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order. In choosing among Index component
securities that meet the initial minimum criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order (as
well as Exchange Rule 901C), the Exchange will select components that: (1) have a minimum market value of at least U.S.
$75 million, except that for each of the lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account
for no more than 10% of the weight of the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly
trading volume in the U.S. markets over the previous six-month period of not less than one million shares (or ADRs)
except that for each of the lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more
than 10% of the weight of the Index, the trading volume shall be at least 500,000 shares in each of the last six months;
(3) have at least 90% of the numerical Index value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting
the current criteria for standardized option trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities
that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities. In addition, no
individual stock in the Index may represent more than 25% of the Index weight (at the time of 
rebalancing) and the five highest weight stocks may not constitute more than 60% of the Index weight (at the time of
rebalancing).

The Amex will ensure that not more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities
that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, one component ADR, accounting for 8% of the Index value, has the majority of its trading volume occurring
on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, an exchange with which the Amex does not currently have in place an effective information
sharing agreement.

If the Index fails at any time to satisfy the maintenance criteria set forth in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval
Order and Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will immediately notify the Commission of that fact and will not open for
trading any additional series of options of the Index unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be significant
and the Commission concurs in that determination, or unless the continued listing of options on the Mexico Index has
been approved by the Commission under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.

Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options 



Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These
Rules cover issues as such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently
used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options
on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Group under Rule 900C(b)(1).
With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (

i.e

., within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

See

 Amendment No. 4. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Amex believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for
orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with deep, liquid markets as well as expeditious executions. The
Amex represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction
of Mexico Index Options.

the introduction of Index options and Index LEAPS.

II. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Mexico Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities
market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with Mexican securities.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
19

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding
that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult
for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be
derived by market participants likely would be outweighted by the potential for manipulation, diminished public
confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed
Index options and full-value Index LEAPS will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect the overall
movement of Mexican stocks and ADRs in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that these Index
options will provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions regarding Mexican securities traded
in the U.S. securities markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets
in a cost effective manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be traded
on an index computed at one-tenth the value of the Mexico Index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing
them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term market moves, at a reduced
cost.

The trading of options on the Mexico Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex adequately has addressed these concerns.



A. Index Design and Structure



The Commission finds that the Mexico Index is a narrow-based index. The Mexico Index is composed of only ten securities,
all of which represent Mexico companies.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, in light of the limited number of components in the Index, the Commission believes it is proper to classify
the Mexico Index as narrow-based and apply Amex's rules governing narrow-based index options to trading in the Index
options.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
20

</FOOTNAME>
The reduced-value Mexico Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index and calculated by
dividing the Index value by ten, is identical to the Mexico Index.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, Liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the
period from November, 1993 through May, 1994, ranging from a high of 430,000 shares per day to a low of 106,000 shares
per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging, during the same
period, from a high of $31 billion to a low of $156.92 billion, with the mean and median being $6.77 billion and $1.94
billion, respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of ten component securities, no one particular
security or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 24 percent
of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 60 percent
of the Index's value. Fourth, at least 90 percent of the securities in the Index, by weight, and at least 80 percent of
the number of components of the Index, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed maintenance
requirement will ensure that the Index is substantially comprised of options-eligible securities. Fifth, if the
Amex increases the number of component securities to more than thirteen or decreases that number to less than nine,
the Amex will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new strike
price or expiration month series of Mexico Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against material
changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Amex's obligations to protect investors
and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Mexico Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the Amex will be required to
ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes
that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Mexico Index in any significant way through trading in
component stocks, ADRs, or securities underlying ADRs (or options on those securities) coupled with, as discussed
below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, will help deter such illegal activity.


<FOOTNOTE>
21&blank;

See 

Amendment No. 3.
</FOOTNOTE>


Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Amex has agreed to apply the initial listing and maintenance standards
set forth in the Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order to the Index and Index options. These standards are reasonably
designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that
the generic standards covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume, and relative weightings of component
stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks are adequately capitalized and sufficiently
liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates an Index. Thus, the Commission believes that the satisfaction
of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation of the Index.

B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Mexico Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Mexico LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special
risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks
of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts.
Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized
options currently traded on the Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the
protection of investors in Mexico Index options and full-value and reduced-value Mexico Index LEAPS.



C. Surveillance



The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Amex, NYSE, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Further, as to present and future ADR components of the Index, either the Exchange will have comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreements with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. will be the
relevant market for surveillance purposes.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
If the prices of the ADR components, or the composition of the Index, should change so that greater than 20% of the weight
of the Index would be represented by ADRs whose underlying securities were not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement with the Amex, then it would be difficult for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in
this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade
options on this Index. The Amex should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 20% of the numerical
value of the Index is represented by ADRs whose underlying securities are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index may
warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is
subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement,

</FOOTNOTE>


D. Market Impact



The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Mexico Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS, on the Amex will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets. First, as described above,
for the most part, no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because at least 90% of the numerical
value of the Index and at least 80% of the components of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's
options listing standards, and because each of the component securities must be subject to last sale reporting pursuant
to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities. Third, the 7,500
contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to minimize potential
manipulation and market impact concerns.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
25

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Amendment No. 3.


</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission believes that settling expiring Mexico Index options (including full-value and reduced-value Index
LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts,
valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help
reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Lastly, the Commission believes the ability to use Auto-Ex for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers
with liquid markets and efficient executions.



<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>


See

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992).

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
27

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) (1988).


</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, and Amendment No. 4 to the Exchange's
proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 4 clarifies that the Exchange will apply its current rules to determine applicable position limits
for the Index options and, therefore, raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Furthermore, the Commission notes
that the Amex did not realize the proposal would have been eligible for filing, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of
the Act, under the Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order. Accordingly, because the effectiveness of the proposal
was therefore delayed, in part, by confusion over the proper method under which to file, and considering the proposal
has already been subject to a 21-day comment period, and no comments were received, the Commission believes it is consistent
with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change, as amended, on an accelerated basis.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by September 2, 1994.

It therefore is Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change, as amended, (SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;94&hyph;20) is approved.

</ADDRESS>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Defined Asset Funds_Equity Income Fund, a unit investment trust registered under the Act, consists of a number
of series (each a ``Series'') that include each of the Select Ten Series. All of the Series currently outstanding are
Select Ten Series. Merrill Lynch is the agent for the sponsors of the Series. Applicants request that the relief sought
herein apply to future Series for which Merrill Lynch serves as agent for the sponsors.

2. The investment objective of each Select Ten Series is to seek a greater total return than the stocks comprising an
entire related published index (

e.g.,

 the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Hang Seng Index, or the Financial Times Industrial Ordinary Share Index) (each
an ``Index''). Certain Series of the Select Ten Series acquire approximately equal values of the ten stocks in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average having the highest dividend yields as of a specified date and holds those stocks for approximately
one year (each a ``Dow Series''). The other Select Ten Series create their portfolios in a similar manner using securities
that are included in other Indexes. The sponsors of the Series intend that, as each Select Ten Series terminates, a
new Series based on the appropriate Index will be offered for the next year.

3. Each Series has a contemplated date (a ``Rollover Date'') on which holders of units in that Series (a ``Rollover
Series'') may at their option redeem their units in the Rollover Series and receive in return units of a subsequent
Series of the same type (a ``New Series'') which is created on or about the Rollover Date, and has a portfolio which contains
securities (``Qualified Securities'') which are (i) actively traded (

i.e.,

 have had an average daily trading volume in the preceding six months of at least 500 shares equal in value to at least
25,000 United States dollars) on an average (a ``Qualified Exchange'') which is either (a) A national securities
exchange which meets the qualifications of section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or (b) a foreign securities
exchange that meets the qualifications set out in the proposed amendment to rule 12d3&hyph;1(d)(6) under the Act
as proposed by the Commission and that releases daily closing prices, and (ii) included in an Index.

<TEXT>
 

4. There is normally some overlap from year to year in the stocks having the highest dividends yields in an Index and,
therefore, between the portfolios of each Rollover Series and the New Series. In the case of the 1993 Spring Series
of the Dow Series, 7 of the 10 securities were identical. To date each Rollover Series has, in connection with its termination,
sold all of its portfolio securities on the New York Stock Exchange as quickly as practicable. Similarly, a New Series
acquires its portfolio securities in purchase transactions on the New York Stock Exchange. This procedure creates
brokerage commissions on portfolio securities of the same issue that are borne by the holders of units of both the Rollover
Series and the New Series. Applicants, therefore, request an exemptive order to permit any Rollover Series to sell
portfolio securities to a New Series and a New Series to purchase those securities.

5. In order to minimize overreaching, Merrill Lynch shall certify in writing to the trustee of the Rollover Series
and the New Series, following each sale from a Rollover Series to a New Series, (a) That the transaction is consistent
with the policy of both the Rollover Series and the New Series, as recited in their respective registration statements
and reports filed under the Act, (b) the date of such transaction, and (c) the closing sales price on the Qualified Exchange
for the sale date of the securities subject to such sale. The trustee will then countersign the certificate, unless,
in the unlikely event that the trustee disagrees with the closing sales price listed on the certificate, the trustee
immediately informs Merrill Lynch orally of any such disagreement and returns the certificate within five days to
Merrill Lynch with corrections duly noted. Upon Merrill Lynch's receipt of a corrected certificate, if Merrill Lynch
can verify the correct price by reference to an independently published list of closing sales prices for the date of
the transaction, Merrill Lynch will ensure that the price of units of the New Series, and distributions to holders
of the Rollover Series with regard to redemption of their units or termination of the Rollover Series, accurately
reflect the corrected price. To the extent that Merrill Lynch disagrees with the trustee's corrected price, Merrill
Lynch and the trustee will jointly determine the correct sales price by reference to a mutually agreeable, independently
published list of closing sales prices for the date of the transaction.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for an affiliated person of a registered investment company
to sell securities to or purchase securities from the company. Investment companies under common control may be considered
affiliates of one another. The Series may be under common control because they have identical or common sponsors,
and Merrill Lynch as agent for the sponsors.

2. Section 17(b) provides that the SEC shall exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes
that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching; (b) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the general provisions of the Act. Under section 6(c), the SEC may exempt classes of
transactions if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants
believe that the proposed transactions satisfy the requirements of sections 6(c) and 17(b).

3. Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Act permits registered investment companies that might be deemed affiliates solely
by reason of common investment advisers, directors, and/or officers, to purchase securities from or sell securities
to one another at an independently determined price, provided certain conditions are met. Paragraph (e) of the rule
requires an investment company's board of directors to adopt and monitor the procedures for these transactions to
assure compliance with the rule. A unit investment trust does not have a board of directors and, therefore, may not
rely on the rule. Applicants represent that they will comply with all of the provisions of rule 17a&hyph;7, other than
paragraph (e).

4. Applicants represent that purchases and sales between Series will be consistent with the policy of each Series,
as only securities that otherwise would be bought and sold on the open market pursuant to the policy of each Series will
be involved in the proposed transactions. Applicants further believe that the current practice of buying and selling
on the open market leads to unnecessary brokerage fees and is therefore contrary to the general purposes of the Act.
In order to minimize the possibility of overreaching, applicants have agreed to comply with the conditions discussed
below.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each sale of Qualified Securities by a Rollover Series to a New Series will be effected at the closing price of the
securities sold on a Qualified Exchange on the sale date, without any brokerage charges or other remuneration except
customary transfer fees, if any.

2. The nature and conditions of such transactions will be fully disclosed to investors in the appropriate prospectus
of each future Rollover Series and New Series.

3. The trustee of each Rollover Series and New Series will (a) Review the procedures relating to the sale of securities
from a Rollover Series and the purchase of securities for deposit in a New Series and (b) make such changes to the procedures
as the trustee deems necessary that are reasonably designed to comply with paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 17a&hyph;7.

4. A written copy of these procedures and a written record of each transaction pursuant to this order will be maintained
as provided in rule 17a&hyph;7(f).

Applicants' Representations



1. FAMF is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust and registered
under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 FAMF currently offers four series of shares: Diversified Growth Fund, Managed Income Fund, Limited Term Tax Free
Income Fund, and Equity Income Fund (collectively, the ``Acquired Funds''). As of June 13, 1994, FAMF had total net
assets of approximately $129 million.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
FAMF was organized in 1992 as ``The Boulevard Funds'' and changed its name to FAMF on May 18, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


2. FAIF is an open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation and registered under the
Act.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 FAIF currently offers seventeen series of shares. One of these series is the Limited Term Income Fund (together with
three series to be created in connection with the proposed transactions, the ``Acquiring Funds''). As of June 13,
1994, FAIF had total net assets of approximately $979 million.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
FAIF was incorporated in 1987 as ``SECURAL Mutual Funds, Inc.'' and changed its name to FAIF in 1991.

</FOOTNOTE>


3. The Adviser acts as investment adviser to each series of FAMF and FAIF. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of First Bank System, Inc. (``FBS'').

4. Boulevard Bank National Association (``Boulevard Bank'') is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of FBS. Boulevard
Bank and its affiliates hold of record through a nominee more than 5% of the outstanding shares of each Acquired Fund,
and they hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. All such shares
are held for the benefit of others in a trust, agency, custodial, or other fiduciary or representative capacity. Boulevard
Bank and its affiliates do not have an economic interest in any such shares.

5. First Trust National Association (``First Trust'') also is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBS and acts as custodian
for FAMF and FAIF. First Trust and its affiliates hold of record in their own name and in the name of a nominee more than
5% of the outstanding shares of one of the Acquiring Funds, and they hold or share voting and/or investment discretion
with respect to a portion of such shares. All such shares are held for the benefit of others in a trust, agency, custodial,
or other fiduciary or representative capacity. First Trust and its affiliates do not have an economic interest in
any such shares.

6. FBS acquired the holding company for Boulevard Bank on March 25, 1994, and thus became the indirect 100% owner of
Boulevard Bank. Boulevard Bank was the investment adviser to each series of FAMF until March 28, 1994. Thus, FBS' acquisition
of indirect ownership of Boulevard Bank arguably constituted a sale of Boulevard Bank and an assignment of its advisory
contract with FAMF within the meaning of section 15(f). On March 25, 1994, the shareholders of FAMF approved the Adviser
as successor investment adviser to each series of FAMF and elected a new Board of Trustees of FAMF. The new members of
the FAMF Board are identical to the members of the FAIF Board of Directors, except that one director of FAIF does not
serve on FAMF's board. This individual was not nominated to serve on FAMF's board in order to ensure that at least 75%
of FAMF's trustees would be ``disinterested,'' as required by the ``safe harbor'' provisions of section 15(f)(1)(A).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
The proxy statement provided to shareholders of FAMF in connection with their March 25, 1994 meeting stated that the
section 15(f)(1)(A) requirement that at least 75% of FAMF's directors be disinterested may be disregarded in the
future if the SEC grants an exemptive order or no-action relief permitting such action.

</FOOTNOTE>


7. Applicants propose that the Acquired Funds be combined with and into the Acquiring Funds in tax-free reorganizations
(the ``Reorganizations''). In the Reorganizations, each Acquiring Fund will acquire all of the assets and liabilities
of the respective Acquired Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund, which then will be distributed to former
shareholders of the Acquired Fund. The number of Limited Term Income Fund shares to be issued in exchange for each Managed
Income Fund share of each class will be determined by dividing the net asset value of one Managed Income Fund share of
such class as of the effective time of the Reorganization (before giving effect thereto) by the net asset value of one
Limited Term Income Fund share of the same class at such time. In the case of the three Acquired Funds which are being
acquired by newly created Acquiring Funds, the share exchanges will take place on a share-for-share basis.

8. Each Acquired Fund and each Acquiring Fund offers or will offer Retail Class, CDSC Class, and Institutional Class
shares.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Each such class of each Acquired Fund is subject to front-end and deferred sales charges and to rule 12b&hyph;1 and
shareholder servicing fees that are identical to those of its counterpart Acquiring Fund. In addition, each Acquired
Fund is subject to investment advisory fees which are identical to those of its counterpart Acquiring Fund. In the
Reorganizations, former Acquired Fund shareholders will receive Acquiring Fund shares of the class which corresponds
to that of their Acquired Fund shares and which have an aggregate net asset value equal, at the effective time of the
Reorganizations, to that of their Acquired Fund shares. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions
of each Acquired Fund are substantially similar to those of its respective Acquiring Fund.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
4

</FOOTNAME>
Each series of FAIF and FAMF is authorized to issue multiple classes of shares in reliance on an exemptive order issued
to the distributor of their shares. Investment Company Act Released Nos. 19698 (Sept. 9, 1993) (notice) and 19757
(Oct. 4, 1993) (order).

</FOOTNOTE>


9. The Adviser has agreed to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses for each class of each Acquiring Fund to the
extent that it is currently doing so with respect to the counterpart classes of the respective Acquired Funds, in each
case through January 31, 1996. As a result, through such date former Acquired Fund shareholders will retain the benefit
of the fee waivers currently applicable to them following the Reorganization. The differential among classes in
the total expense cap agreed to by the Adviser is and will be equal to the differential in rule 12b&hyph;1 fees applicable
to the respective classes.

10. Former holders of Acquired Fund CDSC Class shares who receive Acquiring Fund CDSC Class shares in the Reorganizations
will receive credit for the period they held Acquired Fund CDSC Class shares in applying any contingent deferred sales
charge on Acquiring Fund CDSC Class shares and in applying any conversion feature. In addition, in applying any deferred
sales charge on purchases of Retail Class shares, credit will be given for the period a former Acquired Fund shareholder
who is subject to such a deferred sales charge held his or her shares.

11. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 will be filed with respect to the Reorganizations. A special meeting
of shareholders of FAMF will be held to consider and act upon the Reorganizations in accordance with the Act and Massachusetts
law. If the required shareholder votes are obtained, the closing is expected to take place shortly thereafter.

12. At meetings held June 8, 1994, the Board of Trustees of FAMF and the Board of Directors of FAIF, including the disinterested
trustees and directors, found, as required by rule 17a&hyph;8(a), that participation in the Reorganizations is
in the best interests of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds and that the interests of existing shareholders
of such funds will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganizations. The Boards also unanimously approved the Reorganizations.
In doing so, the Boards considered: The compatibility of the investment objectives, policies, and restrictions
of the respective Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds; the expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring
Funds of the Reorganizations; the anticipated tax-free nature of the Reorganizations; the terms and conditions
of the Reorganizations; the costs associated with the Reorganizations, and the agreement of the Adviser to bear such
costs; the anticipated advisory fees and sales charges before and after the Reorganization, the Adviser's agreement
to waive a portion of such fees, and the provision for giving credit to former Acquired Fund shareholders for the period
they held their shares in applying deferred sales charges; and the potential benefits to the Adviser of the Reorganizations.

13. The expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds considered by the Boards include: elimination
of certain duplicative expenses of separate funds and of separate legal entities; spreading of relatively fixed
expenses across larger asset bases; potential increased sales of the surviving funds due to the ability of FAIF to
offer a ``full line'' of funds; and facilitation of portfolio management. The potential benefits to the Adviser considered
by the Boards include potentially reduced expenses for advisory fee waivers to the extent that the total expense ratios
before waivers of the combined funds decrease as a result of the Reorganizations. The Boards found that the expected
advantages to the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds outweighed the potential benefits to the Adviser.

14. Applicants have agreed not to make any material changes to the reorganization agreements that affect the application
without the prior approval of the SEC staff. Applicants also have agreed not to waive, amend, or modify any provision
of the reorganization agreements that is required by state or federal law in order to effect the Reorganizations.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling,
or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of any other person is an affiliated person
of that person.

2. Section 17(a), in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered company, or any company
controlled by such registered company, any security or other property.

3. Section 17(b) provides that the Commission may exempt a transaction from the provisions of section 17(a) if evidence
establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and
fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent
with the policy of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.

4. Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases
or sales of substantially all of the assets of registered investment companies that are affiliated persons solely
by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers, provided that certain
conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied.

5. As noted above, the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds have a common investment adviser. Thus, the Reorganizations
would be exempt from the provisions of section 17(a) by virtue of rule 17a&hyph;8, but for the fact that the Acquiring
Funds and the Acquired Funds may be affiliated for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. Boulevard Bank and
its affiliates hold of record more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of each of the Acquired Funds and hold
or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. Because of this ownership,
each Acquired Fund is an affiliated person of Boulevard Bank under section 2(a)(3)(B). Boulevard Bank is an affiliated
person of the Adviser because it is under common ownership and control with the Adviser. The Adviser, in turn, is an
affiliated person of each Acquiring Fund under section 2(a)(3)(E) by virtue of its investment advisory relationship
with these funds. Therefore, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of an affiliated person of each Acquired
Fund.

6. Similarly, one Acquiring Fund might be deemed an affiliated person of an affiliated person of its counterpart Acquired
Fund because First Trust and its affiliates hold of record more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of such
Acquiring Fund and hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares.
7. Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such
registered company is a joint, or joint and several, participant with such person in contravention of such rules and
regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered
company on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participant. Rule 17d&hyph;1 under
the Act provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the SEC grants exemptive relief
after considering whether the participation of the investment company is consistent with the provisions, policies
and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the participation in on a basis different from or less advantageous than
that of other participants.
8. The proposed sale of assets by each Acquired Fund to its respective Acquiring Fund and the related transactions
involved in the Reorganizations might be deemed to be a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which a registered
investment company and affiliated person of such company are participants.
9. Applicants submit that the Reorganizations meet the standards for relief under section 17(b) and rule 17d&hyph;1,
in that the terms of the Reorganizations, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the Reorganizations are consistent with the policy
of each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund; the Reorganizations are consistent with the general purposes of the Act;
the participation of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds in the Reorganizations on the basis proposed is consistent
with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act; and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different
from or less advantageous than that of other participants does not outweigh the advantages of such participation.
10. Section 15(f) of the Act permits an investment adviser or affiliate thereof to receive any amount or benefit in
connection with the ``assignment'' of its investment advisory contract with a registered investment company if
the requirements of that section are satisfied. Section 15(f)(1)(A) requires that, for three years after the transaction,
at least 75% of the directors of the investment company (or its successor) are not interested persons, within the meaning
of section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the investment adviser or predecessor investment adviser of such investment company.
11. Applicants request an exemption from section 15(f)(1)(A) because FBS' acquisition of indirect ownership of
Boulevard Bank constituted a sale of Boulevard Bank and an assignment of its advisory contract with FAMF within the
meaning of section 15(f).
12. Although FAMF's Board of Trustees currently meets the 75% requirement of section 15(f)(1)(A), upon completion
of the Reorganizations FAIF's board of directors will not because two of its six directors will be deemed ``interested
persons'' of the Adviser under section 2(a)(19). Thus, unless exemptive relief from section 15(f)(1)(A) is granted,
the Reorganizations cannot be completed within the ``safe harbor'' of section 15(f) unless the Board of Directors
of FAIF is reconstituted by either adding two disinterested directors or by securing the resignation of one interested
director. Neither of these actions is believed by applicants to be in the best interests of FAIF shareholders or necessary
for the protection of FAMF shareholders.
13. Section 15(f)(3) of the Act provides that if an assignment of an investment advisory contract with a registered
investment company results in a successor investment adviser to such company and such adviser is then an investment
adviser with respect to other assets substantially greater in amount than the amount of assets of such company, such
discrepancy in size of assets shall be considered by the Commission in determining whether or to what extent an application
for exemption from the provisions of section 15(f)(1)(A) should be granted.
14. As of June 13, 1994, FAMF had total net assets of approximately $129 million, while FAIF had total net assets of approximately
$979 million. Applicants submit that this substantial disparity in assets should be taken into account under section
15(f)(3) in determining whether to grant exemptive relief. Applicants believe that it is appropriate to compare
the overall size of FAIF to that of FAMF, because the question is whether the Board that is responsible for all series
of FAIF (and not just for the Acquiring Funds) is to be reconstituted. Applicants further submit that the requested
relief from section 15(f)(1)(A) is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection
of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the Act, as required by section 6(c).

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. FAF is a open-end management investment company organized as a Minnesota corporation and registered under the
Act. FAF currently offers five series of shares: Money Fund, Institutional Money Fund, CT Government Fund, Institutional
Government Fund, and CT Treasury Fund. Each series is a money market fund within the meaning of rule 2a&hyph;7 under
the Act. The Adviser acts as investment adviser to each series. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of First Bank
System, Inc. (``FBS'').

2. First Trust National Association (``First Trust'') also is a wholly owned subsidiary of FBS, and acts as custodian
for FAF. First Trust and its affiliates hold of record in their own name and in the name of their nominee more than 5% of
the outstanding shares of Institutional Money Fund, Institutional Government Fund, and CT Government Fund, and
they hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. All such shares are
held for the benefit of others in a trust, agency, custodial, or other fiduciary or representative capacity. First
Trust and its affiliates do not have any economic interest in any such shares.

3. Applicants propose that Money Fund and CT Government Fund (the ``Acquired Funds'') be combined with and into, respectively,
Institutional Money Fund and Institutional Government Fund (the ``Acquiring Funds'') in tax free reorganizations
(the ``Reorganizations''). In the Reorganizations each Acquiring Fund will acquire all of the assets and liabilities
of its respective Acquired Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund, which then will be distributed to former
shareholders of the Acquired Fund. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of each Acquired Fund
are identical or substantially similar to those of its respective Acquiring Fund.

4. The number of Acquiring Fund shares to be issued in exchange for each Acquired Fund share will be determined by dividing
the net asset value of one Acquired Fund share as of the effective time of the Reorganization (before giving effect
thereto) by the net asset value of one Acquiring Fund share at such time. Because each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund
computes its net asset value per share using the amortized cost method under rule 2a&hyph;7, these procedures will
result in a share-for-share and dollar-for-dollar exchange of Acquiring Fund shares for Acquired Fund shares, without
adjustment. It is a condition to closing of the Reorganizations that the net asset value per share of each of the Acquiring
Funds and the Acquired Funds immediately before the effective time, so computed, be $1.00 per share and that the net
asset value per share of each Acquiring Fund immediately after the reorganizations, so computed, be $1.00 per share.

5. At a meeting on June 8, 1994, the Board of Directors of FAF, including the disinterested directors, made the findings
required under rule 17a&hyph;8 and unanimously approved the Reorganizations. In doing so, the Board considered:
(a) The compatibility of the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of the respective Acquired Funds
and Acquiring Funds; (b) the expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds of the Reorganizations;
(c) the anticipated tax-free nature of the Reorganizations; (d) the terms and conditions of the Reorganization;
(e) the costs associated with the Reorganizations, and the agreement of the Adviser to bear such costs; (f) the anticipated
advisory fees before and after the Reorganization and the Adviser's agreement to waive a portion of such fees; and
(g) the potential benefits to the Adviser of the Reorganizations.

6. The differences between the respective Acquiring Funds and Acquired Funds are principally in their respective
rule 12b&hyph;1 plans and in the customers to whom they are marketed, not in their objectives, policies, and restrictions.
The Board has determined that these differences can be accommodated with equal effectiveness by combining the funds
that have an identity of objectives, policies, and restrictions and by instituting a ``multiple class'' structure
in the surviving funds. These contemplated ``multiple class'' arrangements are not the subject of the application,
but their approval by FAF shareholders is a condition to the closing of the Reorganizations.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Board has further determined that significant advantages may accrue to shareholders of the Acquired Funds and
the Acquiring Funds as a result of the proposed combinations.

</FOOTNAME>
SEI Financial Services Company, the distributor for each series of FAF, has obtained an exemptive order permitting
funds distributed by it to issue multiple classes. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19698 (Sept. 9, 1993) (notice)
and 19757 (Oct. 4, 1993) (order). 

</FOOTNOTE>


7. The expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds considered by the Board include the elimination
of certain duplicative expenses of separate funds; spreading of relatively fixed expenses across larger asset bases;
potential increased sales of the surviving funds due to the addition of new classes and channels of distribution;
and facilitation of portfolio management. The potential benefits to the Adviser considered by the Board include
potentially reduced expenses for advisory fee waivers to the extent that the total expense ratios before waivers
of the combined funds decrease as a result of the Reorganizations. The Board found that the expected advantages to
the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds outweighed the potential benefits to the Adviser. 

8. Applicants agree not to make any material changes to the reorganization agreements that affect the application
without the prior approval of the SEC staff. Applicants also have agreed not to waive, amend or modify any provision
of the reorganization agreements that is required by state or federal law in order to effect the Reorganizations.



9. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 will be filed with the Commission with respect to the Reorganizations.
A special meeting of shareholders of FAF will be held to consider and act upon the Reorganizations in accordance with
the Act and Minnesota law. At the special meeting, FAF shareholders also will consider and act upon proposals to authorize
the issuance of shares of each series of FAF in multiple classes and to institute or modify rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution
plans with respect to certain of these classes. If these proposals are approved by shareholders and the Reorganizations
are consummated, after the Reorganizations FAF will consist of three series: a ``Money Fund'' series (currently
Institutional Money Fund); a ``Government Fund'' series (currently Institutional Government Fund); and a ``Treasury
Fund'' series (currently CT Treasury Fund), each of which will be offered in three classes. 


10. If the proposed Reorganizations and multiple class structure are approved by shareholders, former shareholders
of Money Fund would become shareholders of the new Retail Class of the current Institutional Money Fund, and former
shareholders of CT Government Fund would become shareholders of the new Corporate Treasury Class of the current Institutional
Government Fund. 


11. Investment advisory fees would remain unchanged at .40% of average daily net assets for former shareholders of
Money Fund when they become shareholders of Institutional Money Fund. Investment advisory fees would decrease from
.50% to .40% of average daily net assets for former shareholders of CT Government Fund when they become shareholders
of Institutional Government Fund. The Adviser has agreed to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses with respect
to the new Retail Class of Institutional Money Fund to the extent that total expenses of such class exceed .75% of average
daily net assets, and to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses with respect to the new Corporate Treasury Class
of Institutional Government Fund to the extent that total expenses of such classes exceed .60% of average daily net
assets, in each case through July 31, 1995. The differential among classes in the total expense cap agreed to by the
Adviser is and will be equal to the differential in rule 12b&hyph;1 fees applicable to the respective classes. As a
result, through such date former Acquired Fund shareholders will retain the benefit of the fee waivers currently
applicable to them following the Reorganization.

Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling,
or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of any other person is an affiliated person
of that person.

2. Section 17(a), in pertinent part, prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated
person of such a person, acting as principal, from selling to or purchasing from such registered company, or any company
controlled by such registered company, any security or other property.

3. Section 17(b) provides that the Commission may exempt a transaction from the provisions of section 17(a) if evidence
establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and
fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and that the proposed transaction is consistent
with the policy of the registered investment company concerned and with the general purposes of the Act.

4. Rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act exempts from the prohibitions of section 17(a) mergers, consolidations, or purchases
or sales of substantially all of the assets of registered investment companies that are affiliated persons solely
by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers, provided that certain
conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied.

5. As noted above, the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds have a common investment adviser. Thus, the Reorganizations
would be exempt from the provisions of section 17(a) by virtue of rule 17a&hyph;8, but for the fact that the Acquiring
Funds and the Acquired Funds may be affiliated for reasons other than those set forth in the rule. First Trust, which
is under common ownership and control with the Adviser, and its affiliates hold of record in their own name and in the
name of their nominees more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of each of the Acquiring Funds and one of the
Acquired Funds and hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. Because
of this 5% ownership, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of First Trust under section 2(a)(3)(B). First Trust,
in turn, is an affiliated person of the Adviser under section 2(a)(3)(C) by virtue of their common ownership and control
by FBS. The Adviser, in turn, is an affiliated person of each Acquired Fund under Section 2(a)(3)(E) by virtue of its
investment advisory relationship with these funds. Therefore, each Acquiring Fund is an affiliated person of an
affiliated person of each Acquired Fund.

6. Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such
registered company is a joint, or joint and several, participant with such person in contravention of such rules and
regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered
company on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participant. Rule 17d&hyph;1 under
the Act provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the Commission grants exemptive
relief after considering whether the participation of the investment company is consistent with the provisions,
policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous
than that of other participants.

7. The proposed sale of assets by each Acquired Fund to its respective Acquiring Fund and the related transactions
involved in the Reorganizations might be deemed to be a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which a registered
investment company and affiliated person of such company are participants.

8. Applicants submit that the Reorganizations meet the standards for relief under section 17(b) and rule 17d&hyph;1,
in that the terms of the Reorganizations, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the Reorganizations are consistent with the policy
of each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund; the Reorganizations are consistent with the general purposes of the Act;
the participation of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds in the Reorganizations on the basis proposed is consistent
with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act; and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different
from or less advantageous than that of other participants does not outweigh the advantages of such participation.

Alabama Power Company (70&hyph;8191)



Notice of Proposal to Amend Charter, or Alternatively, to Waive Charter Provision; Order Authorizing Solicitation
of Proxies




Alabama Power Company (``Alabama Power''), 600 North 18th Street, Birmingham, Alabama 35291, a public-utility
subsidiary company of The Southern Company (``Southern''), a registered holding company, has filed a declaration
under Sections 6(a)(2), 7, and 12(e) of the Act and Rules 62 and 65 thereunder.

Alabama Power's charter currently provides that, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of
shares of preferred stock at the time outstanding, Alabama Power shall not issue or assume any securities representing
unsecured debt having maturities of less than 10 years (other than for the purpose of refunding or renewing outstanding
unsecured securities resulting in equal or longer maturities or redeeming or otherwise retiring all outstanding
shares of preferred stock or of any senior or equally ranking stock) if immediately after such issue or assumption:
(1) The total outstanding principal amount of all securities representing unsecured debt will thereby exceed 20%
of the aggregate of all existing secured debt and the capital stock, premiums thereon, and surplus, as stated on the
books, or (2) the total outstanding principal amount of all securities representing unsecured debt of maturities
of less than ten years will thereby exceed 10% of such aggregate.

Alabama Power proposes to submit to its preferred stock shareholders and to its sole common stock shareholder, Southern,
at a special meeting of such holders to be held on or about September 21, 1994, a proposal to amend Alabama Power's charter
as follows. Alabama Power, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of shares of preferred stock
at the time outstanding, shall not issue or assume any securities representing unsecured debt having maturities
of less than 10 years (other than for the purpose of refunding or renewing outstanding unsecured securities resulting
in equal or longer maturities or redeeming or otherwise retiring all outstanding shares of preferred stock or of any
senior or equally ranking stock) if immediately after such issue or assumption the total outstanding principal amount
of all securities representing unsecured debt will thereby exceed 20% of the aggregate of all existing secured debt
and the capital stock, premiums thereon, and surplus, as stated on the books (``Proposal 1'').


Should Proposal 1 fail to receive the necessary 662/3% vote of the total number of shares of preferred stock outstanding,
and 662/3% vote from Southern as the owner of all outstanding shares of common stock, Alabama Power proposes to seek
authority from its preferred shareholders to issue or assume, until October 1, 2004, additional unsecured debt.
This unsecured debt will have maturities of less than ten years, and will exceed 10% of capital, surplus, and secured
debt, provided that the amount of securities representing unsecured debt having maturities of less than ten years
outstanding on January 1, 2005, shall not exceed such 10% limitation, and Alabama Power's total indebtedness represented
by unsecured securities shall not exceed 20% of capital, surplus, and secured debt (``Proposal 2''). Proposal 2 requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number the shares of preferred stock outstanding.


Alabama Power intends to solicit proxies from its preferred shareholders to approve the alternative proposals.
Alabama Power has filed its proxy solicitation material and requests that the its declaration with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for voting by its preferred shareholders to approve the alternative proposals be permitted
to become effective forthwith as provided in Rule 62(d).

It appearing to the Commission that Alabama Power's declaration regarding the proposed solicitation of proxies
should be permitted to become effective forthwith, pursuant to Rule 62:

It Is Ordered, that the declaration regarding the proposed solicitation of proxies, be, and it hereby is, permitted
to become effective forthwith, under Rule 62, and subject to the terms and conditions as prescribed in Rule 24 under
the Act.

Notice of Action Subject to Intergovernmental Review



SBA is bound by the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.'' SBA has
promulgated regulations spelling out its obligations under that Executive Order. See 13 CFR Part 135, effective
September 30, 1983.

In accordance with these regulations, specifically 135.4, SBA is publishing this notice to provide public awareness
of the pending application of thirty-three presently existent Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) for refunding.
Also, published herewith is an annotated program announcement describing the SBDC program in detail.

This notice is being published four months in advance of the expected date of refunding these SBDCs. Relevant information
identifying these SBDCs and providing their mailing address is provided below. In addition to this publication,
a copy of this notice is being simultaneously furnished to the affected State single point of contact which has been
established under the Executive Order.

The State single points of contact and other interested State and local entities are expected to advise the relevant
SBDC of their comments regarding the proposed refunding in writing as soon as possible. The SBDC proposal cannot be
inconsistent with any area-wide plan providing assistance to small business, if there is one, which has been adopted
by an agency recognized by the State government as authorized to do so. Copies of such written comments should also
be furnished to Ms. Johnnie L. Albertson, Associate Administrator for SBDC Program, U.S. Small Business Administration,
409 Third Street, S.W., Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20416. Comments will be accepted by the relevant SBDC and SBA for
a period of 120 days from the date of publication of this notice. The relevant SBDC will make every effort to accommodate
these comments during the 120-day period. If the comments cannot be accommodated by the relevant SBDC, SBA will prior
to refunding the SBDC, either attain accommodation of any comments or furnish an explanation of why accommodation
cannot be attained to the commentor prior to refunding the SBDC.



Description of the SBDC Program



The SBDC operates under the general management and oversight of SBA, but with recognition that a partnership exists
between the Agency and the SBDC for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. SBDC services shall
be provided pursuant to a negotiated Cooperative Agreement with full participation of both parties.

SBDCs operate on the basis of a state plan to provide assistance within a state or designated geographical area. The
initial plan must have the written approval of the Governor. As a condition to any financial award made to an applicant,
non-Federal funds must be provided from sources other than the Federal Government. SBDCs operate under the provisions
of P.L. 96&hyph;302, as amended by P.L. 98&hyph;395, a Notice of Award (Cooperative Agreement) issued by SBA, and
the provisions of this Program Announcement.



Purpose and Scope



The SBDC Program is designed to provide quality assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth, expansion,
innovation, increased productivity and management improvement. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources
of the Federal, State, and local governments with the resources of the educational system and the private sector to
meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. SBDCs also coordinate with other SBA programs
of business development and utilize the expertise of these affiliated resources to expand services and avoid duplication
of effort.



Program Objectives



The overall objective of the SBDC Program is to leverage Federal dollars and resources with those of the state, academic
community and private sector to:

(a) strengthen the small business community;

(b) contribute to the economic growth of the communities served;

(c) make assistance available to more small businesses than is now possible with present Federal resources;

(d) create a broader based delivery system to the small business community.



SBDC Program Organization



SBDCs are organized to provide maximum services to the local small business community. The lead SBDC receives financial
assistance from the SBA to operate a statewide SBDC Program. In states where more than one organization receives SBA
financial assistance to operate an SBDC, each lead SBDC is responsible for Program operations throughout a specific
regional area to be served by the SBDC. The lead SBDC is responsible for establishing a network of SBDC subcenters to
offer service coverage to the small business community. The SBDC network is managed and directed by a full-time Director.
SBDCs must ensure that at least 80 percent of Federal funds provided are used to provide services to small businesses.
To the extent possible, SBDCs provide services by enlisting volunteer and other low cost resources on a statewide
basis.



SBDC Services



The specific types of services to be offered are developed in coordination with the SBA district office which has jurisdiction
over a given SBDC. SBDCs emphasize the provision of indepth, high-quality assistance to small business owners or
prospective small business owners in complex areas that require specialized expertise. These areas may include,
but are not limited to: management, marketing, financing, accounting, strategic planning, regulation and taxation,
capital formation, procurement assistance, human resource management, production, operations, economic and
business data analysis, engineering, technology transfer, innovation and research, new product development,
product analysis, plant layout and design, agri-business, computer application, business law information, and
referral (any legal services beyond basic legal information, and referral require the endorsement of the State Bar
Association,) exporting, office automation, site selection, or any other areas of assistance required to promote
small business growth, expansion, and productivity within the State. The SBDC shall also ensure that a full range
of business development and technical assistance services are made available to small businesses located in rural
areas.

The degree to which SBDC resources are directed towards specific areas of assistance is determined by local community
needs, SBA priorities and SBDC Program objectives, and agreed upon by the SBA district office and the SBDC.

The SBDC must offer quality training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing and prospective small business
owners. As a general guideline, SBDCs should emphasize the provision of training in specialized areas other than
basic small business management subjects. SBDCs should also emphasize training designed to reach particular audiences
such as members of SBA priority and special emphasis groups.



SBDC Program Requirements



The SBDC is responsible to the SBA for ensuring that all programmatic and financial requirements imposed upon them
by statute or agreement are met. The SBDC must assure that quality assistance and training in management and technical
areas are provided to the State small business community through the State SBDC network. As a condition of this agreement,
the SBDC must perform, but not be limited to, the following activities:

(a) the SBDC ensures that services are provided as close as possible to small business population centers. This is
accomplished through the establishment of SBDC subcenters.

(b) the SBDC ensures that lists of local and regional private consultants are maintained at the lead SBDC and each SBDC
subcenter. The SBDC utilizes and provides compensation to qualified small business vendors such as private management
consultants, private consulting engineers, and private testing laboratories.

<PARENT> FR940812-2-00080 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) the SBDC is responsible for the development and expansion of resources within the State, particularly the development
of new resources to assist small business that are not presently associated with the SBA district office.

(d) the SBDC ensures that working relationships and open communications exist within the financial and investment
communities, and with legal associations, private consultants, as well as small business groups and associations
to help address the needs of the small business community.


(e) the SBDC ensures that assistance is provided to SBA special emphasis groups throughout the SBDC network. This
assistance shall be provided to veterans, women, exporters, the handicapped, and minorities as well as any other
groups designated a priority by SBA. Services provided to special emphasis groups shall be performed as part of the
Cooperative Agreement.



Advance Understandings



The Lead SBDC and all SBDC subcenters shall operate on a forty (40) hour week basis, or during the normal business hours
of the State or Host Organization, throughout the calendar year. The amount of time allowed the Lead SBDC and subcenters
for staff vacations and holidays shall conform to the policy of the Host Organization.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OSTP proposes that a standing advisory body be established within the Executive Branch to consider issues of bioethics
arising from research on human biology and behavior, and the applications of that research. This action would fulfill
a need recognized by all branches of the Federal government. For example, a report by the House of Representatives
Committee on Government Operations recommended establishment of an advisory committee to examine the ethical,
legal and social implications of the Human Genome Project. The proposed advisory body would expand the work of the
National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research; the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare's Ethics Advisory Board; and the President's Commission for the Study of Ethics
Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research.







OSTP seeks comments on a draft charter for a proposed National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC). The NBAC would
report to the President's National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). This arrangement will facilitate access
to the deliberations and recommendations of the NBAC for the Executive Branch agencies most heavily invested in biological
and behavioral research.





The Commission would be asked to identify and develop broad overarching principles to govern the ethical conduct
of biological and behavioral research, and the applications of that research. The proposed NBAC would not have responsibility
for the review and approval of individual projects.




The draft charter seeks to strike a balance between defining the NBAC's agenda so as to fulfill governmental needs,
and allowing the Commission sufficient flexibility to advise the government on issues this group of experts and stakeholders
believe should be addressed.

The charter specifies two prospective areas of inquiry, issues in the management and use of genetic information and
protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. Discrete issues that full under these two broad topics
include: issues of genetic privacy, screening for genetic disorders, intellectual property rights, access to research
data or materials developed with public funding, current views on informed consent, adequacy and implementation
of Federal human subject research guidelines, and the concept of ``minimal risk.''




In addition, several other potential issues for consideration by the Commission have been raised in discussions
to date including: adequacy and implementation of Federal human subject research guidelines, recommendations
on requirements to maintain research data, and the ethical aspects of access to costly health care technology. The
question is, how best might the scope of the Commission's charge be defined so as to meet public needs for deliberation
of pressing issues in bioethics, without being so broad as to limit its effectiveness? An alternative option for addressing
the last issue, for example, might be referral to a body more directly involved with decisions related to the provisions
of health care and relevant cost/benefit analysis.



The Commission would be established in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). As such, its meetings
would be open tot he public and announced in advance to facilitate public participation. In addition, reports produced
by the NBAC would be made available to public either 

in toto, 

or in summary. The purpose of these efforts would be to involve the public in the deliberations of the NBAC to the greatest
extent possible.

As a FACA committee, the NBAC will be required to have a balanced membership. Naturally, selection of Commission members
is going to be a delicate process that should take into account the social and cultural mores of the times in order to
establish a body that is sensitive to the potential impacts of its deliberations and recommendations. The draft charter
proposes that members be appointed by the President. Suggestions for potential members or membership posts are sought
through this Notice.






Draft Charter






Proposed National Bioethics Advisory Commission





Purpose



The National Bioethics Advisory Commission will provide advice and make recommendations to the National Science
and Technology Council, other appropriate entities and the public, on bioethical issues arising from research on
human biology and behavior, and the applications of that research.




Authority





42 U.S.C. 6617(a)(2). This Commission is governed by the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA),
Public Law 92&hyph;463, as amended (5 U.S.C. Appendix 2), which sets forth standards for the formation of advisory
committees, and implementing regulations (41 CFR 101&hyph;6.10).

Functions


The National Bioethics Advisory Commission shall advise, consult with, and make recommendations to the National
Science and Technology Council and other appropriate entities, and also make their advice and recommendations available
to the public. The Commission's purview includes the appropriateness of departmental, agency, or other governmental
programs, policies, assignments, missions, guidelines, and regulations as they relate to bioethical issues arising
from research on human biology and behavior, and applications of that research. The Commission shall identify broad,
overarching principles to govern the ethical conduct of research, citing individual projects only as illustrations
for such principles. The Commission shall not be responsible for the review and approval of individual projects.
As a first priority, the Commission will direct its attention to consideration of:



A. Issues in the management and use of genetic information; and
B. Protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects.



In receiving and responding to requests for advice and recommendations from the National Science and Technology
Council, the Commission shall consider four criteria in establishing priority for its activities:



A. The public health or public policy urgency of the bioethical issue.
B. The relation of the bioethical issue to the goals for Federal investment in science and technology.
C. The absence of another body able to fruitfully deliberate on the bioethical issue.
D. The extent of interest in the issue across the government. (The Commission ordinarily will not deliberate on a bioethical
issue of interest to just one department or agency.)



The Commission also shall have the authority to identify bioethical issues, on its own behalf, for deliberation.
The Commission will accept suggestions of issues for consideration from Federal agencies, Congress and the public.
The Commission's decision to deliberate on a specific topic shall be made in consultation with the National Science
and Technology Council. In all such instances, the four stated criteria for establishing priority shall pertain.


Structure


The National Bioethics Advisory Commission shall consist of not more than 15 members, including the Chairperson.
Appointments shall be made by the President, who shall select from knowledgeable non-Government experts and community
representatives with special qualifications and competence to deal effectively with bioethical issues of concern
to the participating departments and agencies. At least one member shall be selected from each of the following categories
of primary expertise: (i) bioethics/theology; (ii) social/behavioral science; (iii) law; (iv) medicine/allied
health professions; and (v) biological research. At least three members shall be selected from the general public,
bringing to the Commission expertise other than that listed. The membership shall be approximately evenly balanced
between scientists and non-scientists.
Members shall be appointed for overlapping four-year terms. Initially, members will be appointed for two-, three-
or four-year terms. Terms of more than two years are contingent upon renewal of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission
by appropriate action prior to its termination. The Chairperson shall be appointed by the President. The term of office
for the Chairperson shall be two years, renewable by appropriate action of the President.
If a vacancy occurs on the Commission, the President shall make an appointment to fulfill the term. Any member appointed
to fill a vacancy occurring prior to expiration of the term for which his or her predecessor was appointed shall serve
for the remainder of such term. Members may serve after the expiration of their terms until their successors have taken
office.
The Commission may conduct inquiries, hold hearings and establish subcommittees, as necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kissimmee
Municipal Airport, effective July 8, 1994.





Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act (ASNA) OF 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility
program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measure should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program
recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to the following
determinations:

a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;

b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical users, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and

d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport nose compatibility program are delineated in FAR
Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Orlando, Florida.
The City of Kissimmee submitted to the FAA on December 2, 1993, the noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation
produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from July 1, 1991, through November 29, 1993. The
Kissimmee Municipal Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on January 11, 1994. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register 

on January 28, 1994.
The Kissimmee Municipal Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to
the year 1998. It was requested that FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described
in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on January 11, 1994, and was required by a provision
of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise
control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval
of such program.
The submitted program contained nineteen (19) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA
completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have
been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Administrator effective July 8, 1994.
Outright approval was granted for seventeen (17) of the specific program elements. One (1) proposed action element
was approved in part and one (1) proposed action element was disapproved for purposes of Part 150 pending submission
of sufficient information to make an informed analysis under Part 150 criteria. The approval action was for the following
program elements:

OC1 
The airport director will work with the airship (blimp) operators to develop takeoff/landing flight track procedures
to avoid adjacent noise sensitive areas during periods of heavy airship traffic at the airport. The procedures will
develop flight plans for each airship operator to use a takeoff and landing direction toward the middle of the airport
where Runways 15&hyph;33 and 6&hyph;24 intersect and will consider current overall demand and weather conditions
at the airport. FAA Action: Disapproved for purposes of Part 150 pending the submission of sufficient information
to make an informed analysis under Part 150 criteria. The NCP includes no information on the noise impacts of the blimps
or on noise benefits of the proposed measure. The airport may either submit sufficient information for a Part 150 approval
or may implement the proposed procedures for operational reasons provided that the procedures meet established
guidelines under FAR Part 91 
Pgs. 5&hyph;10 and 6&hyph;1, and Table 6&hyph;1.
OC2 
All turbojet and turboprop aircraft operators will be requested to use the NBAA arrival and close-in departure procedures.
The operators of turbojet-powered aircraft which have a maximum certificated takeoff weight over 75,000 pounds
will be requested to use the FAR Part 91.87 standard noise abatement departure profiles. FAA Action: Approved in part.
The use of the NBAA procedures for turbojet and turboprop aircraft less than 75,000 pounds Gross Takeoff Weight is
approved as a voluntary measure. Subsequent to the preparation of this NCP, FAR Part 91 was recodified and Advisory
Circular 91&hyph;53A outlining Noise abatement procedures for large aircraft was issued. Since there has been a
change in guidance not contemplated by the NCP, the measure suggesting use of specific departure procedures for large
aircraft is disapproved pending receipt of additional information specifying the procedure to be used and describing
its noise benefits 
Pgs. 5&hyph;9, 5&hyph;10, and 6&hyph;2; Table 6&hyph;1; and Appendices G and I.
OC3 
Voluntary preferential flight track procedures are proposed for implementation at the airport as follows: Turbo-jet
and turbo-prop aircraft departing Runway 15 will be requested to maintain runway heading as long as possible while
climbing and to initiate a turn to any heading only after reaching an altitude of 1,300 feet MSL or reaching a point along
the extended centerline past the intersection of Route 17&hyph;92 and just before the west shoreline of Lake Tohopekaliga
(which is further defined as the intersection of the extended runway centerline and the 175
&cir; radial from the Orlando VOR). VFR traffic remaining in the airport's standard traffic patterns should maintain
runway heading upon departure until reaching an altitude of 700 feet AGL. IFR traffic taking off from Runway 33 will
fly the extended runway centerline until reaching an altitude of 500 feet AGL. At that time the aircraft may be turned
to an on-course or a typical westerly heading depending upon local traffic conditions and the aircraft's destination.
Typically aircraft departing Runway 33 will not go north or east because of conflicts with MCO. These measures will
be subject to traffic at the airport, local traffic at Kissimmee, and current weather conditions. FAA Air Traffic
will approve and control use of such procedures, and the City of Kissimmee will publicize the measures to pilots. FAA
Action: Approved as a voluntary measure 
Pgs. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;12, 6&hyph;2, and 6&hyph;3; Exhibit 5&hyph;8, and Table 6&hyph;1.

Land Use Measures
0



PC1 
The City of Kissimmee and Osceola County both have Comprehensive Plans that address land use compatibility in the
vicinity of the airport to some extent. It is recommended that the Comprehensive Plans be revised to incorporate the
Noise Exposure Maps developed in this Part 150 Noise Study. This will be effective in reducing non-compatible development
in vacant areas impacted by the future DNL 65 dB noise exposure contour. FAA Action: Approved. This measure will be
effective in preventing the introduction of new non-compatible development 
Pgs. 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;34, and 6&hyph;3; and Table 6&hyph;2.
PC2 
The City of Kissimmee has an ordinance which establishes noise zones for Runway 15&hyph;33 based on aircraft noise
levels. This ordinance establishes land use restrictions and sound level requirements for construction which are
related to the noise zones. It is recommended that the noise zone descriptions in the ordinance be changed to conform
with the NEM. This will ensure that the areas of applicability for airport related noise control measures are correctly
defined. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;34 to 5&hyph;36, and 6&hyph;3; Tables 4&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;2; and Appendix C.
PC3 
Osceola County does not currently have an airport noise zoning ordinance. It is recommended that Osceola County develop
overlay zoning to supplement the existing land zoning. This would prevent non-compatible development of vacant
areas in Osceola County within the noise contours. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;34 to 5&hyph;36, and 6&hyph;4; and Tables 4&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;2.
PC4 
The City of Kissimmee Noise Ordinance has a real estate sales disclosure provision which requires that a notification
of potential noise impacts be given to prospective purchasers of residential property located in noise Zones B (DNL
70 to 75) and C (DNL 65 to 70). No residential development is allowed in noise Zone A (DNL 75 and above). A listing of property
requiring notification is maintained and updated yearly. This ordinance requires that a disclosure statement be
completed for the sale of all residential property located in a noise Zone which is filed with the property deed. This
measure recommends that the current noise disclosure statement be revised to include an additional clause and that
the disclosure statement be made available to all title companies and real estate agents in the Kissimmee area. The
measure also recommends that the exact location of affected properties be coordinated with the Osceola County Property
Appraiser's office and that the Osceola County regulations be modified to add a real estate sales disclosure provision
to a County noise ordinance. This measure will provide notification of the possibility of aircraft flyovers and airport
generated noise to prospective purchasers of residential property within the DNL 65 noise contour. FAA Action: Approved.
The FAA strongly discourages additional residential development in areas with noise exposure levels greater than
DNL 65dB 
Pgs. 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;37, and 6&hyph;4; Table 6&hyph;2; and Appendices C and D.
PC5 
It is recommended that the Noise Exposure Maps (NEM) and other criteria that were developed in this Part 150 Noise Study
be adopted into the Kissimmee City Code. It is also recommended that Osceola County develop a County noise ordinance
compatible with the City's ordinance. This will provide the City and County with the latest NEM documentation for
determining compatible land uses within the noise zones and criteria for sound level reduction requirements for
structures. FAA Action: Approved. The FAA strongly discourages the development of additional noise sensitive uses
within the DNL 65dB contour rather than allowing such uses if sound attenuated. This is, however, a matter within the
jurisdiction of the City and County and if such development is deemed necessary by those bodies, the houses should
be sound attenuated during construction 
Pgs. 5&hyph;37 and 6&hyph;4; Exhibit 4&hyph;5; Tables 4&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;2; and Appendix C.
PC6 
It is recommended that City and County subdivision regulations be modified to help ensure that adequate disclosure
of airport generated noise is provided where needed. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;37 and 6&hyph;4; and Table 10.
PC7 
It is recommended that an interlocal agreement between the City of Kissimmee and Osceola County providing that a formal
site plan review for development within the DNL 65 noise contour be established. This will provide the City and Airport
with an opportunity to review and respond to the potential compatibility of proposed development in the County with
the operation and future plans of the airport. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;38 and 6&hyph;4; and Table 6&hyph;2.
PC8 
It is recommended that the City of Kissimmee and Osceola County adopt acoustical treatment standards for new structures
within noise Zones of DNL 65 exposure and above, and that these standards be included in their local comprehensive
plans, local development codes, and noise ordinances. This will be effective in reducing interior noise levels for
all new construction within the noise zones where land uses could not be re-zoned to more compatible uses. FAA Action:
Approved. The FAA strongly discourages the development of additional noise sensitive uses within the DNL 65dB contour
rather than allowing such uses if sound attenuated. This is, however, a matter within the jurisdiction of the City
and County and if such development is deemed necessary by those bodies, the houses should be sound attenuated during
construction 
Pgs. 5&hyph;38, 5&hyph;39, 6&hyph;4, and 6&hyph;5; Table 6&hyph;2; and Appendix C.
PC9 
Subject to available funding, the City of Kissimmee, with the owner's consent, will purchase vacant property located
within the DNL 65, 70, or 75 noise contours that is expected to be developed for non-compatible use. Purchase will be
considered only if other measures such as the purchase of development rights or other less costly methods will not
be effective in a particular case. Acquired noise property will either be retained for aviation use as needed or resold
for a compatible use. FAA Action: Approved, subject to an evaluation at the time of implementation that the property
is within the DNL 65 contour, and to a determination that the property either has been zoned incompatibly or is in imminent
danger of being developed incompatibly unless it is acquired by the airport operator 
Pgs. 5&hyph;38, 5&hyph;39, 6&hyph;4, and 6&hyph;5; and Table 6&hyph;2.
PC10 
Subject to available funding, the City of Kissimmee will purchase the development rights of vacant property within
the DNL 65, 70, or 75 noise contours which cannot be purchased outright. This will compensate property owners for limiting
proposed development to compatible uses. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;37 and 6&hyph;9; and Table 6&hyph;2.
PC11 
The City of Kissimmee will establish a noise committee with City and County residents to monitor noise complaints
and provide a channel of communication between the public and the airport. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;39 and 6&hyph;5; and Table 6&hyph;2.
PC12 
It is recommended that the City of Kissimmee and Osceola County incorporate or reference Florida Statute 333, Airport
Zoning Law of 1945, in their respective comprehensive plans and land development codes. The power to adopt airport
zoning regulations is included in section 333.03. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;40, and 6&hyph;5; Table 6&hyph;2; and Appendix R.
RC1 
It is recommended that the City of Kissimmee, subject to available funding and with the owner's consent, purchase
existing non-compatible residential property. Acquired noise property will either be retained for aviation use
as needed or resold for a compatible use. Net income from the resale of property acquired with AIP noise funds would
be returned to the AIP fund or used to purchase other eligible noise impacted lands. FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;40 and 6&hyph;6; Exhibit 5&hyph;5; and Table 6&hyph;3.
RC2 
It is recommended that a redevelopment program be established where the city of Kissimmee would acquire existing
non-compatible properties located within the DNL 65 noise contour. Structures would be demolished or remodeled
for a compatible use, and the acquired land would either remain the property of the City or be resold with avigation
easements attached to ensure long-term compatibility. The cost of demolition or removal of structures would be deducted
from the income derived from resale of the property. Net income from the resale of property acquired with AIP noise
funds would be returned to the AIP fund or used to purchase other eligible noise impacted lands. FAA Action: Approved.
This approval does not constitute any determination with respect to AIP eligibility. Parts of this redevelopment
program may be ineligible for Federal funding, as the airport operator recognizes in the NCP 
Pgs. 5&hyph;41 and 6&hyph;6; Exhibit 5&hyph;5; and Table 6&hyph;3.
RC3 
It is recommended that the City of Kissimmee or Osceola County, with consent of the owners, purchase avigation easements
to be held by the City for property located within the DNL 65, 70, or 75 noise contours if the land acquisition and redevelopment
programs are not possible. The easement may be acquired in exchange for acoustical treatment of an existing structure.
FAA Action: Approved 
Pgs. 5&hyph;42 and 6&hyph;6; Exhibit 5&hyph;5; and Table 6&hyph;3.
RC4 
It is recommended that, subject to available funding, the City of Kissimmee establish an acoustical treatment program
to consider all eligible existing non-compatible buildings located within the DNL 65 noise contour where acquisition
and conversion to compatible use cannot be accomplished. Eligibility will be determined by interior noise monitoring
to determine if the need for acoustical treatment exists under the City's Noise Ordinance. Acoustical treatment
would be performed on a priority basis with schools first, single family homes second, and multi-family homes and
apartment complexes third. A structure within the DNL 70 noise contour would be treated before a structure within
the DNL 65 but outside the DNL 70 noise contour. It is recommended that specific consideration be given to Pleasant
Hill Elementary School and Osceola High School. FAA Action: Approved. Further specific consideration of acoustical
treatment for Pleasant Hill Elementary school and Osceola High School should include consideration of the location
of the DNL 65 dB contour and revised noise zones. AIP funding may not be available to fund projects located in areas outside
the DNL 65 dB contour

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for the
proposed US&hyph;23 freeway from M&hyph;13 to M&hyph;55, Arenac and Iosco Counties, Michigan.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), is preparing an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) for the proposed US&hyph;23 freeway from M&hyph;13 to M&hyph;55 in Arenac and Iosco Counties, Michigan.
The purpose of the new freeway is to assist northeast Michigan in its economic development program which has been intensified
subsequent to the closure of Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The freeway will provide a high speed non-stop facility which
will make the region's markets, resources, and employment base accessible to more clients and customers. An accelerated
schedule for the completion of this 48 kilometer (30 mile) project is important to other economic development efforts.
Alternatives under consideration include: (1) No Action, (2) low Capitol Improvements, and (3) Freeway on New Location..





The Low Capitol Alternate proposes the possibility of passing relief lanes, intersection and interchange improvements,
and other minor traffic safety modifications. 

Other alternates eliminated from further study through public and agency comments include a southern Bypass of Standish
and Omer to M&hyph;65 and improvements along the existing alignment (roadways).


The freeway alternate is a four lane divided, controlled access freeway with a median on a new location. The route under
study would begin at the existing US&hyph;23/M&hyph;13 interchange south of Standish and bypass Standish 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) east of US&hyph;23 to interchange with the existing US&hyph;23 northeast of Standish near Senske Road. From
this point, the roadway proceeds northeast to cross the Rifle River about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) northwest of Omer.
The route then heads to parallel the railroad (along its west side) to Whittemore Road and then north to interchange
with M&hyph;55 west of Tawas (between Imperial Drive and Rempert Road).



Early coordination with a number of Federal, State, and local agencies has identified the more significant issues
to be addressed in the EIS. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are requested
to be cooperating agencies in the development of the proposed action. A scoping document will be prepared identifying
the alternates being considered and the social, economic, and environmental issues involved.


The scoping document anticipated in August of 1994 and will be available to all interested agencies, organizations,
and individuals on request. A pre-study meeting will be held in 1994 to provide the public an opportunity to discuss
the proposed action. Comments on the scoping document and issues identified are invited from all interested parties.
Requests for a copy of the scoping document or any comments submitted should be addressed to the above contact persons.

The Draft EIS is scheduled for completion in fall 1995 and will be available for public and agency review.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In its regulations implementing the Railroad User Fee provisions of section 20115 of Title 49, United States Code
(formerly section 216 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (see 49 C.F.R. Part 245.301(a)), the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) indicated that it would publish a notice each year in the 

Federal Register

 identifying FRA's calculations of the total railroad user fee to be collected for the fiscal year, the assessment
rate per train mile, the assessment rate per employee hour, and the assessment rate per road mile (as adjusted by the
sliding scale). 



For fiscal year 1994, user fee assessments totalling $37,580,232 are based on 615,155,035 total industry train miles;
151,745 total industry road miles; and 519,282,243 total industry employee hours. 

The base assessment rate per road mile is $86.49, with applicable adjustments for the sliding scale as follows:

ACTION: 

Request for written submissions from the public regarding the market access implications of accession of Austria,
Finland, Norway and Sweden to the European Union.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden signed a treaty of accession on June 24, 1994 with the European Union. This treaty
is expected to be ratified by the end of 1994 and implemented on January 1, 1995. The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)
requests written submissions from the public concerning the market access implications of the EU accession of these
four countries, for U.S. production and trade in goods and services.



These items would include any expected increases in tariff rates in the four countries due to their application of
the EU's common external tariff.

Submissions must be received on or before noon, September 16, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Robert Kasper, Director for EFTA Affairs (202&hyph;395&hyph;3320), Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 600

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 24, 1994, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden signed a treaty of accession with the European Union (EU) and
its member states. This treaty is expected to be ratified by the end of 1994 and implemented on January 1, 1995.




Under Article XXIV: 7(a) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT contracting parties must formally
notify the GATT of their intention to enter into a customs union, such as the European Union. A GATT working party will
then be established to examine the proposed customs union in relation to the standards of Article XXIV, including
the rule that the ``duties and other regulations of commerce imposed *&blank;*&blank;* in respect of trade with contracting
parties not parties to such union *&blank;*&blank;* shall not on the whole be higher or ore restrictive than the general
incidence of the duties and other regulations of commerce applicable in the constituent territories prior to the
formation of such union

*&blank;*&blank;*'' The GATT working party will examine the agreement to determine whether the duties and trade
regulations of the enlarged EU will be higher or more restrictive with respect to the EU's trading partners than the
duties and trade regulations of the EU and the four countries individually prior to accession.



Under the treaty of accession, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will begin to apply the EU's trade regime, including
the EU's common external tariff schedule, for almost all items, on January 1, 1995. While the United States has yet
to receive trade information from the European Union upon which to evaluate the expected trade consequences of this
accession, it is likely that U.S. production and trade in some sectors will be adversely affected.

If a country joining a customs union plans to raise a duty rate which is bound in its GATT schedule of concessions, it
may renegotiate the tariff concession under GATT Article XXIV: 6 and the procedures of Article XXVIII. This renegotiation
may result in the provision of tariff compensation (reduction of duties) covering an equivalent value of trade.

The Chairman of the Trade Policy Staff Committee invites written submissions from the public on the expected implications
of the accession treaty on access to the markets of Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, or the existing EU member states
for U.S. products and services. Submissions will be used in decisions regarding U.S. negotiating priorities with
respect to the EU enlargement. The information obtained from these submissions will be considered during the GATT
working party examination of the EU accession and the GATT Article XXIV: 6 tariff compensation negotiations.

Submissions should describe the product or service in question, and, in the case of products, should include the Harmonized
System tariff heading(s). Submissions should describe the present market access for the products or services, including
value and quantity of exports, any existing problems, and should identify the changes that are expected to result
from the implementation of the accession treaty. Submissions may also include recommendations for appropriate
compensation to be sought for instances of diminished market access. These recommendations could include such items
as reductions in the EU common external tariff on goods, improvements to EU market access commitments on services,
or other changes in the EU trade regime for goods and services.

Comments must be submitted in English and provided in twenty copies to Carolyn Frank, Secretary of the Trade Policy
Staff Committee, Room 414, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20506, no later than 12:00 noon on Friday, September
16, 1994.



Public Inspection of Submissions



Except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6, submissions will be
available for public inspection by appointment at the USTR Public Reading Room, in room 101, Office of the United States
Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW, Washington, D.C. An appointment to review the file may be made by calling

<DOCTITLE>Trade Policy Staff Committee; Generalized System of Preferences (GSP); Review of GSP Benefits Lost by Thailand in
1989</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice and solicitation of public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In 1989, Thailand lost some GSP benefits following a determination that Thailand does not provide adequate and effective
intellectual property right protection. The purpose of this notice is: (1) to announce the initiation of a review
process to consider whether any of the GSP benefits that were lost by Thailand should be restored; and (2) to solicit
public comments on the restoration of such benefits.



</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



GSP Subcommittee, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington,
DC 20506. The telephone number is (202) 395&hyph;6971.


</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background



On January 19, 1989, President Reagan determined, pursuant to sections 502 and 504 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 2462 and 2464), that Thailand does not fully provide adequate and effective means to secure, exercise and
enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property (54 

Federal Register

 3573). Accordingly, the President: (1) denied a competitive need limit waiver; (2) revoked four competitive need
limit waivers; (3) imposed reduced competitive need limits to certain specified articles; and (4) established a
policy that future requests for competitive need limit waivers for Thai products would not be considered until Thailand
provides adequate and effective intellectual property right (IPR) protection.

As a result of the 1989 determination, Thailand became ineligible for GSP treatment on articles in the following subheadings
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS):




HTS subheading 0713.31.40&blank;mung beans
HTS subheading 1102.30.00&blank;rice flour
HTS subheading 1103.14.00&blank;rice meal
HTS subheading 6702.90.65&blank;artificial flowers
HTS subheading 6908.10.20&blank;ceramic tile
HTS subheading 7113.11.20&blank;jewelry
HTS subheading 7113.11.50&blank;jewelry
HTS subheading 7113.19.50&blank;jewelry
HTS subheading 7113.20.50&blank;jewelry
HTS subheading 9401.40.00&blank;seats
HTS subheading 9401.61.60&blank;seats
HTS subheading 9401.69.80&blank;seats
HTS subheading 9403.30.80&blank;wooden office furniture
HTS subheading 9403.40.90&blank;wooden kitchen furniture
HTS subheading 9403.50.90&blank;wooden bedroom furniture
HTS subheading 9403.60.80&blank;other wooden furniture



II. GSP Review for Thailand



On July 20, 1994, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor announced that USTR would initiate a review process to determine
whether any of the GSP benefits that Thailand lost in 1989 should be restored because of progress by the Government
of Thailand on IPR protection. This notice formally announces the initiation of a review process to determine whether
Thailand's eligibility for GSP treatment for the products in these HTS subheadings should be restored. The decision
on whether to restore any GSP benefits to Thailand will be based on the requirements of the GSP law, Title V of the Trade
Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461 

et seq.

), and on Thai progress on IPR protection, including the final passage of a copyright act that is consistent with international
standards, the creation of an IPR court and the rapid implementation of Thai obligations under the Uruguay Round intellectual
property agreements (TRIPs).



III. Public Comments



Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the restoration of the GSP benefits for Thailand that
are described above. Comments must be submitted in 14 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee,
Trade Policy Staff Committee, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506. Comments must be received no later
than 5 p.m. on Wednesday, September 21, 1994. Information and comments submitted regarding Thailand's lost GSP benefits
will be subject to public inspection by appointment with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room, except for information
granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6 and 2007.7. If the document contains business
confidential information, 14 copies of a nonconfidential version of the submission along with 14 copies of the confidential
version must be submitted. The confidential version of the submission should be clearly marked ``Submitted in Confidence''
at the top and bottom of each and every page of the document. A nonconfidential summary of the confidential information
must be included with the confidential submission, along with a written explanation of why the confidential material
should be protected. The version which does not contain business confidential information (the public version)
should also be clearly marked at the top and bottom of each and every page (either ``public version'' or ``non-confidential'').

project, location, and environmental considerations to be addressed in the EIS are provided below (see supplemental
information). In addition to this notice, a public meeting regarding the proposal and preparation of the EIS will
be held.



This notice is published in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations found in 40

on the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS. Comments and participation in this scoping process are encouraged.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 East Valley Farms, Inc. has proposed to lease a 40-acre allotment from Joseph Kintano of the Torres Martinez Band of
Cahuilla Indians for the purpose of constructing and operating a biosolids (digested sewage sludge) composting
facility. The facility would be operated by Pima Gro Systems, Inc., a sister company of East Valley Farms. The facility
would receive daily shipments of treated Class B sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants at other locations
in southern California. Approximately 15,000 tons per month of sludge would be delivered to the facility by truck.
Pima Gro proposes to use an aerated windrow compost process to produce 8,000 tons per month of fully treated and composted
material. The compost product would be sold to agricultural users and nurseries for use as a soil amendment.



The project site is located in the Coachella Valley in south-central Riverside County approximately 35 miles southeast
of the city of Palm Springs. The project vicinity is generally rural with agriculture and aquaculture being the predominant
land uses.

The EIS will address numerous environmental issues, including: geology and soils, water quality, air quality, (including
odor and dust), health and safety, biological resources, cultural resources, traffic, land use, and noise, as well
as any additional issues raised during the scoping process.

NOFA for Preservation Support Grants and Notice of Paperwork Submission: Amendment, Announcement of Paperwork
Control Number, and 
Extension of Application Deadline 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Amendment of NOFA, announcement of paperwork control number, and extension of deadline. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department is amending its NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), and,
therefore, is extending the deadline for applications. In addition, because at the time of publication the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) had not issued a control number for the information collection requirements contained
in that NOFA, the Department advised potential applicants that the paperwork requirements were subject to OMB approval.
Those requirements have now been approved by OMB and the Department is publishing the control number assigned to that
paperwork collection. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The new deadline for submission of applications is September 12, 1994. Applications must be physically received
in the Preservation Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6286, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20410, by 4:30 p.m., EST, on or before the due date. 



</DATE>

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Frank Malone, Director, Office of Preservation and Property Disposition, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Room 6284, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708&hyph;3555. To provide service for
persons who are hearing- or speech-impaired, this number may be reached via TDD by dialing the Federal Information
Relay Service on 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;TDDY (1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339) or 202&hyph;708&hyph;9300.
(Except for the TDD number, telephone numbers are not toll-free.) 



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 14, 1994, the Department published its NOFA for Preservation Support Grants and Notice of Paperwork Submission
(59 FR 30640). As a result of questions that have been raised by potential applicants, in this notice the Department
is amending certain parts of the NOFA. For further clarification, the Department also is advising potential applicants
of changes that have been made in the application kit. Under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) and the requirements of 24 CFR 12.12, the Department therefore is extending the
deadline for submitting applications for funds made available under the NOFA until 30 days from today's publication.
In addition, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in the NOFA have been
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504. 


Potential applicants have raised several questions about some of the certifications contained in the NOFA and application
kit. As a result, one of the certifications (see item 8 in Section V.C, ``Submission Requirements,'' 59 FR at 30648
of the NOFA) has been revised to clarify that, although an applicant should not apply for these funds with the intention
of purchasing properties that are to be assisted with these funds, the Department recognizes that future circumstances
may warrant the applicant or its affiliate to seek an ownership interest as purchaser of last resort in such properties.
In these cases and in recognition of the Department's overriding goal to maintain the greatest possible number of
affordable housing units available for moderate-, low- and very low-income families, special dispensation of this
rule, on a case by case basis, may be granted by the Department. 
Another certification, included in the application kit as Exhibit 8 (pursuant to item 9 in Section V.C of the NOFA),
has been revised to clarify that recipients of Preservation Technical Assistance or Resident Capacity Grants are
eligible applicants for Preservation Support Grant funds. The applicant must certify that it will perform activities
described in its application, and the proscription against the applicant serving as a pass-through intermediary
applies to administering allocations of both components of the Preservation Support Grant. 
These revised certifications are available from the Multifamily Housing Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 6424, Rockville,
MD 20850, telephone number: 1&hyph;800&hyph;955&hyph;2232. Please refer to FR&hyph;3613 and specify that you
are seeking the revised certifications. However, applicants may also prepare, execute, and submit their own certifications
for these two items, based on the following examples (these certifications may be combined): 



Exhibit 8_Certification



As Chief Executive Officer of the organization identified below, I hereby certify that as an applicant for Preservation
Support Grant funds, the organization will perform activities described in its application and will not serve as
a pass-through intermediary to administer an allocation of the Preservation Support Grant. 







[Name of Organization]







[Address of Organization] 







[Signature of Chief Executive Officer]







[Date]







[Print or Type Name and Title of CEO] 


Certification Regarding Ownership Interest


As Chief Executive Officer of the organization identified below, I hereby certify that as an applicant for Preservation
Support Grant funds, the organization and its affiliates do not have, and do not intend to seek, an ownership interest
in developments that the organization would be assisting with these funds. 







[Name of Organization]







[Address of Organization] 







[Signature of Chief Executive Officer]







[Date]







[Print or Type Name and Title of CEO] 


The Department also advises applicants that on the first page of Exhibit 1 in the application kit, item 4 should be corrected:
(1) In the first box, to ask a resident-controlled group to indicate whether it is a local group; and (2) to delete from
the second box the phrase ``with a majority of board participation by tenants in HUD-assisted projects.'' This change
is needed to correct the discrepancy between the NOFA and the application kit definition of a CBO. The correct definition
is in 24 CFR 248.101, which requires that the CBO maintain at least one-third of its governing board's membership for
low-income neighborhood residents, other low-income community residents, or elected representatives of low-income
neighborhood organizations. In addition, page 2 of Exhibit 1 in the application kit is to be deleted; that page was
inadvertently included in the application kit and does not apply to this competition. 
Accordingly, the Department announces that the information collection requirements contained in FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344,
the NOFA for Preservation Support Grants, published on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30640), have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned control number 2502&hyph;0504. Further, FR Doc. 94&hyph;14344
is amended as follows: 
1. On page 30640, column 2, the first sentence in the second paragraph under the heading 

DATES:

 is revised to read as follows:

(8) Certification that the applicant and any of its affiliates do not have, and do not intend to seek an ownership interest

applicant will perform activities described in its application and will not serve as a pass-through intermediary
to administer an allocation of the Preservation Support Grant.
