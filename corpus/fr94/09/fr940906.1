SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 1, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published a notice of its intent to reconsider the definition
and legal interpretation of the term ``commercial purposes'' as used in the definition of ``public aircraft'' (59
FR 39192). The FAA has received numerous telephonic and written requests for an extension of the comment period. The
Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the National Air Carrier Association, and the Helicopter Association
International, request that the comment period be extended until September 15. The Department of the Interior, Department
of Justice, General Services Administration, and the National Association of Police Chiefs request an extension
until October 31. The National Association of State Foresters requests a 30-day extension because of the difficulty
of communicating with all its members during this particular period of time when there are a number of serious forest
wildfires in the West. The FAA has determined that the closing date for comments should be extended to September 30,
1994, to accommodate these requests. Those requesting a longer extension have not advanced compelling reasons why
they cannot have their comments completed by September 30.


The August 1 notice indicated that the reconsideration process should be completed within 90 days, i.e., by the target
date of November 1, 1994. The FAA remains committed to an early resolution of the matter and expects that the reconsideration
process will be completed by December 1, 1994.
Interested persons are invited to submit any arguments, views, or information they consider relevant. All material
received by September 30 will be considered in coming to a final conclusion. Later received material may be considered
as time allows. All material submitted will be available for review and copying by interested persons in the FAA Rules
Docket No. 27836 at the address given above.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that 
proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 
Mark 0100 series airplanes. That action would have required replacement of certain main 
landing gear (MLG) torque link dampers. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) has received new data indicating that the proposed actions 
have been accomplished on all affected airplanes; therefore, the previously identified 
unsafe condition no longer exists. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), 
applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, was published in the 


Federal Register

 on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4607). The proposed rule would have 
required replacement of suspect main landing gear (MLG) torque link dampers with 
serviceable dampers. That action was prompted by a report that certain MLG torque link 
dampers may have been assembled with incorrect parts. The proposed actions were 
intended to prevent loss of the damping characteristics of the torque link damper, which 
could lead to the loss of the MLG wheel assembly of the aircraft during takeoff or landing. 



Since the issuance of that NPRM, Menasco, the manufacturer of the suspect MLG 
torque link dampers, has provided evidence to the FAA that the proposed requirement to 
replace suspect MLG torque link dampers has been accomplished on all affected airplanes. 
(Evidence was provided to the FAA in Menasco's facsimile, dated February 10, 1994, 
which is contained in the Rules Docket.) 

Based on this evidence, the FAA has determined that the previously identified 
unsafe condition no longer exists with regard to Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series 
airplanes. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 

Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and 
does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit 
the agency to any course of action in the future. 

Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a 
proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, 
February 26, 1979).

Airworthiness Directives; Turbomeca Arriel 1 Series Turboshaft Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Turbomeca Arriel
1 series turboshaft engines, that currently requires repetitive checks for engine rubbing noise during gas generator
shutdown, and for free rotation of the gas generator by rotating the compressor manually after the last flight of the
day. This action would continue to require these checks, but eliminates the reference to the Turbomeca service bulletin,
allows the pilot to perform all the checks required in this proposed rule, clarifies the inspection interval requirement
for daily checks, and specifies terminating action for the repetitive checks required by this AD. In addition, this
action would allow the check for engine rubbing noise to be performed during engine motoring, and specifies that the
engine turbine (T4) temperature must be below 150 degrees Centigrade when performing the check for free rotation.
This proposal is prompted by comments submitted by operators of the affected engines in response to the existing AD
and the availability of an improved design 2nd stage nozzle guide vane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are
intended to prevent engine failure due to rubbing of the 2nd stage turbine disk on the 2nd stage turbine nozzle guide
vane, which could result in complete engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Discussion



On November 19, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93&hyph;23&hyph;09,
Amendment 39&hyph;8745 (58 FR 63061, November 30, 1993), applicable to Turbomeca Arriel 1 series turboshaft engines,
to require repetitive checks for engine rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown, and for free rotation of the
gas generator by rotating the compressor manually after the last flight of the day. That action was prompted by a report
of a Turbomeca Arriel 1B engine failure, which resulted in the crash of an Aerospatiale AS350B helicopter. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in engine failure due to rubbing of the 2nd stage turbine disk on the 2nd stage turbine
nozzle guide vane, which could result in complete engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a significant number of comments from operators of the affected
engines indicating that the performance of the checks required by this AD are within the capabilities of the pilot.
The FAA has also determined that instructions contained in the AD are adequate for performance of required actions,
and the Turbomeca Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72 292 0181 need not be incorporated by reference. Other comments indicated
that the interval specified in the existing AD, ``after the last flight of the day,'' is not consistent with operating
and maintenance schedules for operators who typically operate ``around the clock'' on a 24 hours per day basis, such
as medevac or police operators. In response to these comments, a ``daily'' interval has been specified for this check.

In addition, operators reported difficulty in listening for rubbing noises during engine shutdown, and that this
check could be accomplished during engine motoring. The FAA has also determined that the check for free rotation must
be accomplished on a cold engine due to the variation of rotating component clearances with engine temperature. Finally,
the manufacturer has completed testing and analysis, and has accumulated sufficient field experience to substantiate
the design of the improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane. This AD would require installation of modification TU 202,
which incorporates an improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane manufactured from a new material that is more resistant
to fatigue cracking, at the next engine overhaul after the effective date of this AD, but not later than December 31,
1999, as terminating action for the repetitive checks. This calendar end-date is based upon parts availability.

Turbomeca has issued SB No. 292 72 0150, dated April 10, 1992, that specifies installing an improved design 2nd stage
nozzle guide vane.

This engine model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions
of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement
in effect at the time of type certification. The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness
authority for France, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings
of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type
design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;09 to continue to require repetitive checks for engine
rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown, and for free rotation of the gas generator by rotating the compressor
manually at a daily interval until installation of the improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane.

This proposed AD would allow pilots to perform all the required checks. This action does not require special training
beyond that already incurred by pilots of the aircraft having affected engines, or the use of tools or special measuring
equipment, or reference to technical data. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that pilots may perform all the checks
required by this proposed rule as an exception to &sect;43.3 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.3) regarding
the performance of maintenance.

The FAA estimates that 160 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 0.2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $8,000 per engine. Based on an assumed utilization
rate and an assumed modification rate, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators over the five year
compliance period is estimated to be $3,101,600.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Disclosure or Production of Customs Information 
Pursuant to Legal Process

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to clarify the procedures to be followed when subpoenas or
other demands of courts and other authorities, except Congress, are issued to compel the disclosure or production
of Customs information, 

i.e.

, documents, information, or employee testimony, for use in federal, state, local, and foreign proceedings. The
proposed procedures will be applicable to current and former Customs employees and to litigants who seek to compel
Customs employees to disclose or produce Customs information. Specifically, the amendments seek to centralize
in the Office of Chief Counsel determinations concerning the disclosure of such information. The goal of this proposal
is to ensure the uniform processing of subpoenas served on Customs employees and the more efficient use of Customs
personnel resources in responding to requests in a timely manner. The amendments also propose to restructure the
general organizational scheme of part 103 of the Customs Regulations to clarify their application.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


Customs enforces some 600 laws for 60 agencies while facilitating the flow of merchandise in international commerce.
In addition to maintaining records relevant to its enforcement functions, Customs also maintains information that
has a bearing on other law enforcement provisions. Many of the records Customs maintains contain confidential business
information subject to the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, which prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of such
information by an officer or employee of the United States. 
Regulations pertaining to Customs release of information, 

i.e., 

documents, information, or employee testimony, subpoenaed for use in judicial proceedings are found at &sect;103.17
of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.17). But while &sect;103.17 provides some procedures regarding the disclosure
of information, 

e.g., 

the testimony of employees, and the production of documents pursuant to a subpoena 

duces tecum 

in cases both where the agency is and is not a party to a legal proceeding, it does not adequately describe the procedures
for determining whether and how the information should be released in response to such demands. 
In 1992, Customs information was subpoenaed in connection with at least 440 cases. In 1993, the number of cases increased
to approximately 550. These demands for Customs information necessarily draw personnel and other resources away
from the agency's mission to administer the customs and related laws concerning the importation of merchandise.
As litigants increasingly subpoena information in the possession, custody or control of Customs, the need to provide
clear procedures both to Customs personnel and to litigants is urgent. Clarification of the procedures would allow
Customs to manage more effectively the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of such demands while ensuring
Customs has adequate time to properly consider whether the information sought should be made available. 
Accordingly, Customs proposes to restructure the organizational scheme of part 103 of the regulations in general,
to clarify their application, and to amend the provisions of &sect;103.17 in particular, to set forth procedures
applicable to demands for the disclosure and production of Customs-maintained information. In proposing to revise
&sect;103.17, we have considered other federal agencies' positions in this regard, particularly those of the Department
of Justice (28 CFR Part 16, subpart B), bearing in mind the unique mission of the Customs Service as the principal border
enforcement agency of the United States. Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. App., were
relied upon concerning the appropriate burden litigants must bear when they subpoena information from the Federal
government.

In proposing to revise the provisions of &sect;103.17, a balance has been sought to provide clear procedures for Customs
employees and litigants to follow when Customs information is sought in Federal, State, local, and foreign proceedings.
So that limited government resources will not be inordinately tied up with the processing of subpoena demands, the
proposed regulations require litigants demanding Customs-maintained information to demonstrate that the information
sought is (a) relevant and material to the action pending, (b) genuinely necessary to the proceeding, 

i.e., 

a showing of substantial need is made, and (c) unavailable from other sources. In addition, Customs will examine whether
the scope of the request is reasonable. Customs is also proposing that copies of the summons and complaint be attached
to the subpoena, and that the information sought be described with particularity, so that it can be located quickly
and reviewed for privilege, confidentiality, law enforcement sensitivities, and other Customs matters that impact
the decision whether to withhold or release the information. 


Section-by-Section Analysis and Discussion 


Section 103.0 


It is proposed to revise the scope section to state that the extent of production/disclosure of requested Customs
information depends, to some extent, upon whether the information is requested pursuant to statutes, 

i.e.

, the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), or the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), or
demanded on other legal bases, 

i.e.

, pursuant to a subpoena. 


Sections 103.1&hyph;103.13 


These sections are grouped under a new Subpart A, which carries the heading ``Production of documents/disclosure
of information pursuant to the FOIA''. No changes to these regulatory provisions are proposed. 


Sections 103.14&hyph;103.16 and section 103.18 


These sections are reordered and redesignated as 
&sect;&sect;103.31 through 103.34 and grouped under a new Subpart C, which carries the heading ``Other information
subject to restricted access''. Although no changes to these regulatory provisions are proposed, because redesignated
&sect;103.18 (&sect;103.33, see below) has a specific statutory basis 
(19 U.S.C. 1628), this authority citation is added under the authority section for part 103. 


Section 103.17 


This section is redesignated and expanded to embrace seven sections (&sect;&sect;103.21&hyph;103.27), all grouped
under a new Subpart B, which carries the heading ``Production/disclosure in Federal, State, Local, and Foreign proceedings''.
The provisions of the proposed new sections are as follows: 
New &sect;103.21, headed ``Purpose and definitions,'' is in eight paragraphs ((a) through (h)). Paragraph (a) indicates
both the types of information covered and the circumstances under which the regulations apply. Paragraphs (b), (c),
and (d) define the terms ``Customs employee'', ``Customs documents'', and ``originating component'', respectively.
Paragraphs (e) through (g) serve to limit the scope of the regulations, by providing that they are not intended to impede
or restrict the appropriate disclosure of: (1) any information to federal, state, local, or foreign law enforcement
or regulatory agencies (paragraph e); (2) any information to certain federal attorneys and judges in connection
with Customs cases referred by the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense
(paragraph (f)); or, (3) any non-Customs information, in cases where a Customs employee, in a personal capacity,
is either a party or witness to a proceeding (paragraph g). Paragraph (h) provides that these regulations do not create
any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United States.

New &sect;103.22, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in any federal, state, or local
civil proceeding,'' is in eight paragraphs ((a) through (h)). Paragraph (a) generally prohibits the production
or disclosure of Customs documents or testimony by employees in Federal proceedings or State or local civil proceedings,
absent the prior approval of the Chief Counsel's Office. Paragraph (b) requires Customs employees to report a demand
for information under these regulations to the Regional or District Counsel, or to the Office of the Chief Counsel,
depending on the employee's location, and then await instructions. Paragraph (c) requires that parties seeking
Customs documents or testimony provide an affidavit (or, if an affidavit is not feasible, a statement) to Customs
summarizing the information sought and its relevance to the proceeding in question. Paragraph (c) also restricts
disclosure of Customs information to the scope of the demand and authorizes Chief Counsel to waive the foregoing requirements
for cause shown. Paragraph (d) requires service of the affidavit (or statement) at least five working days prior to
the scheduled date of the requested disclosure. Paragraph (e) provides that Chief Counsel shall immediately upon
receipt of the affidavit (or statement) advise the official in charge of the Office or Division of the employee on whom
process was served. Paragraph (f) sets forth the conditions for authorizing the disclosure of Customs information.
Paragraph (g) provides that Chief Counsel will authorize the disclosure of Customs information, after any necessary
consultation with the originating component and such efforts to limit disclosure as are in accordance with the factors
specified in &sect;103.23. 

New &sect;103.23, headed ``Factors in determining whether to disclose information pursuant to a demand'', is in
two paragraphs. Paragraph (a) requires Chief Counsel to consider the applicable rules of procedure and substantive
law of privilege in deciding whether to make disclosures. The regulation adopts a general approach instead of detailing
a list of specific considerations because the application of rules of procedure and the substantive law concerning
privilege may vary according to the nature of the demand. Paragraph (b), however, specifically identifies certain
circumstances in which disclosure of Customs information will not be authorized. These circumstances, in essence,
identify several areas of privilege or legally prohibited, restricted, or discretionary disclosure that are most
relevant to Customs operations. They are intended to be compatible with the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b),
the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and other treaties, statutes, and applicable rules of procedure. These standards
are generally consistent and parallel with those issued under analogous Department of Justice regulations. 

New &sect;103.24, headed ``Procedure in the event a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response
to the demand is required'', provides that when a response is required before appropriate subpoena instructions
have been received from Chief Counsel, the U.S. Attorney, his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative,
shall be requested to appear with the employee upon whom demand has been made. Such legal representative shall then
furnish the court with a copy of the regulations and request a stay of the demand, pending receipt of the instructions.
This section parallels the Department of Justice regulations. 

New &sect;103.25, headed ``Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling'', provides that when a court does not grant
a stay as requested under the preceding section, the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand.
This section again parallels the Department of Justice regulations. 

New &sect;103.26, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a state or local criminal
proceeding'', provides that Customs Regional Commissioners, special agents in charge, and chiefs of field laboratories
may authorize employees under their supervision to attend trials and administrative hearings in state or local criminal
cases to produce records and testify as to facts in their knowledge in their official capacities on behalf of the government.
However, in the event that a defendant requests or demands testimony, document production, or information, Chief
Counsel authorization is required as under this subpart. This section thus clarifies circumstances relating to
requests in state and local proceedings in which Chief Counsel authorization is necessary. 

New &sect;103.27, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a foreign proceeding where
Customs is not a party'', is in five paragraphs ((a) through (e)). Paragraph (a) requires Chief Counsel authorization,
as described in paragraph (b), prior to disclosure of documents or information, or the giving of testimony in response
to a demand or request in a foreign proceeding in which Customs is not a party. Paragraph (b) requires Customs employees
receiving such demands concerning pre-clearance activities, if in the field, to notify immediately the Regional
or District Counsel for the region or district having jurisdiction over the pre-clearance location. In connection
with all other demands, they are to notify immediately the Office of the Chief Counsel. The employee shall then await
appropriate subpoena instructions from the office so notified. This paragraph provides procedural clarification
not provided in the current regulations. Paragraph (c) requires Chief Counsel to immediately acknowledge receipt
of a demand to the Customs official in charge of the office or division of Customs_collectively referred to as the ``originating
component''_that employs or employed the person concerned, as a measure to enhance government efficiency in processing
such demands. Paragraph (d) provides for the authorization of disclosure where the originating component has no
objection and where disclosure is otherwise appropriate within the terms of &sect;103.23. These procedures protect
Customs interests while facilitating international cooperation in judicial proceedings. Paragraph (e) additionally
provides that, in cases where the information requested is related to Customs litigation or investigation, Chief
Counsel will seek to limit the demands through negotiation.

2. The general authority citation for part 103 is revised and specific authority citations for &sect;&sect;103.33
and 103.34 are added to read as follows:





Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 301, 552, 552a; 19 U.S.C. 66, 1624; 31 U.S.C. 9701.

Section 103.34 also issued under 18 U.S.C. 1905.



3. Section 103.0 is revised to read as follows:


&sect;103.0

 Scope.


This part governs the production/disclosure of agency-maintained documents/information requested pursuant
to various disclosure laws and/or legal processes. Thus, the extent of disclosure of requested information may be
dependent on whether the request is pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended
(5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), and/or under other statutory or regulatory authorities,
as required by administrative and/or legal processes. The regulations for this part contain a discussion of applicable
fees for the search, duplication, review, and other tasks associated with processing information requests pursuant
to the FOIA, and also provide for the appeal of agency decisions and sanctions for the improper withholding and/or
the untimely release of requested information. As information obtained by Customs is derived from a myriad of sources,
persons seeking information should consult with the Chief, Disclosure Law Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings,
United States Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229, or the appropriate regional commissioner of Customs or the
public information officer for the region (see locations at &sect;101.3) before invoking the formal procedures
set forth in this part. These regulations supplement the regulations of the Department of the Treasury regarding
public access to records, which are found at 31 CFR part 1, and, in the event of any inconsistency between these regulations
and those of the Department of the Treasury, the latter shall prevail. For purposes of this part, the Office of the Chief
Counsel is considered a part of the United States Customs Service.
4. Sections 103.1 through 103.13 are designated as subpart A and the heading for subpart A is added to read as follows:


Subpart A_Production of Documents/Disclosure of Information Under the FOIA

Subpart B_Production or Disclosure in Federal, State, Local, and Foreign Proceedings



&sect;103.21

 Purpose and definitions.



(a) 

Demands for Customs information subject to regulations.

 This subpart sets forth procedures to be followed with respect to the production/disclosure of any documents contained
in Customs files, any information relating to material contained in Customs files, any testimony by a Customs employee,
or any information acquired by any person, as part of that person's performance of official duties as a Customs employee
or because of that person's official status (hereinafter, collectively referred to as ``information''), in all
federal, state, local, and foreign proceedings when a subpoena, notice of deposition (either upon oral examination
or written interrogatory), order, or demand (hereinafter, collectively referred to as a ``demand'') of a court,
administrative agency, or other authority is issued for such information.

(b) 

Customs employee.

 For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Customs employee'' includes all present and former officers and employees
of the United States Customs Service.

(c) 

Customs documents.

 For purposes of this subpart, the term ``Customs documents'' includes any document (including copies thereof),
no matter what media, produced by, obtained by, furnished to, or coming to the knowledge of, any Customs employee while
acting in his/her official capacity, or because of his/her official status, with respect to the administration or
enforcement of laws administered or enforced by the Customs Service.

(d) 

Originating component.

 For purposes of this subpart, the term ``originating component'' references the Customs official in charge of the
office or division of Customs that employs or employed the person, or the official's designee, served with a subpoena
or other demand for Customs information.

(e) 

Disclosure to government law enforcement or regulatory agencies.

 Nothing in the subpart is intended to impede the appropriate disclosure of information by Customs to federal, state,
local, and foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies.

(f) 

Disclosure to federal attorneys and the Court of International Trade.

 Nothing in this subpart is intended to restrict the disclosure of Customs information requested by the Court of International
Trade, U.S. Attorneys, or attorneys of the Department of Justice, for use in cases which arise under the laws administered
or enforced by, or concerning, the Customs Service and which are referred by the Department of the Treasury to the Department
of Justice for prosecution or defense.

(g) 

Disclosure of non-Customs information.

 Nothing in the subpart is intended to impede the appropriate disclosure of non-Customs information by Customs employees
in any proceeding in which they are a party or witness solely in their personal capacities.

(h) 

Failure of Customs employee to follow procedures.

 The failure of any Customs employee to follow the procedures specified in this subpart neither creates nor confers
any rights, privileges, or benefits on any person or party.



&sect;103.22

 Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in any federal, state, or local civil proceeding.



(a) 

General prohibition against disclosure.

 In any federal, state, or local civil proceeding in which the Customs Service is not a party, no Customs employee shall,
in response to a demand, furnish Customs documents or testimony as to any material contained in Customs files, any
information relating to or based upon material contained in Customs files, or any information or material acquired
as part of the performance of that person's official duties (or because of that person's official status) without
the prior written approval of the Office of Chief Counsel, as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) 

Employee notification to Counsel.

 Whenever a demand for information, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, is made upon a Customs employee,
that employee shall immediately notify the Regional or District Counsel for the region or district where the employee
is located. If the employee is located at Headquarters or outside of the United States, the employee shall immediately
notify the Office of the Chief Counsel. The Customs employee shall await instructions from the Regional Counsel,
District Counsel, Chief Counsel, or their designees concerning the response to the demand.

(c) 

Requesting party's initial burden.

 An affidavit, or, if that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking Customs information, that sets forth a summary
of the documents or testimony sought and its relevance to the proceeding, must be furnished to the appropriate Office
of the Chief Counsel, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Any disclosure authorization for documents or
testimony by a Customs employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such affidavit or statement.
The Chief Counsel may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this paragraph.

(d) 

Required processing time.

 A demand for Customs documents or testimony, together with the affidavit or statement, shall be served at least five
(5) working days prior to the scheduled date of production or disclosure, to ensure that the Chief Counsel has adequate
time to consider the demand.

(e) 

Counsel notification to originating component.

 Upon receipt of a demand and its accompanying affidavit or statement, the Chief Counsel shall immediately advise
the originating component.

(f) 

Conditions for authorization of disclosure. 

The Chief Counsel, subject to the terms of paragraph (h) of this section, may authorize the disclosure of Customs documents
or the appearance and testimony of a Customs employee if: 

(1) The demanded documents or testimony, in the judgment of the Chief Counsel, are appropriate under the factors specified
in &sect;103.23(a) of this subpart; and 

(2) None of the factors specified in &sect;103.23(b) of this subpart exist with respect to the demanded documents
or testimony. 

(g) 

Limitations on the scope of authorized disclosure. 

The Chief Counsel shall, following any necessary consultation with the originating component, authorize the disclosure
of Customs information by a Customs employee without further authorization from Customs officials whenever possible:


Provided, 

that, when the information demanded relates to that collected, assembled, or prepared in connection with litigation
or an investigation supervised by a Customs Office, Chief Counsel, prior to authorizing such disclosure, seeks to
limit the demand to that which would be consistent with the factors specified in &sect;103.23 of this subpart. The
Chief Counsel shall seek to limit the demand through negotiation with appropriate authority.

(h) 

Disclosure of commercial information. 

In the case of a demand for commercial information or commercial documents concerning importations or exportations,
the Chief Counsel or his/her designee shall obtain the authorization of the Assistant Commissioner (Commercial
Operations) or his/her designee prior to the Chief Counsel authorizing the production/disclosure of such documents/information.




&sect;103.23

 Factors in determining whether to disclose information pursuant to a demand. 



(a) 

General considerations. 

In authorizing disclosures pursuant to a demand, the Chief Counsel should consider the following factors: 

(1) Whether the requesting party has demonstrated that the information requested is_

(i) Relevant and material to the action pending, based on copies of the summons and complaint that are required to be
attached to the subpoena 

duces tecum 

or other demand; 

(ii) Genuinely necessary to the proceeding, 

i.e., 

a showing of substantial need has been made; 

(iii) Unavailable from other sources; and, 

(iv) Reasonable in its scope, 

i.e., 

the documents, information, or testimony sought are described with particularity. 
(2) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand
arose; and 

(3) Whether disclosure or testimony is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege. 

(b) 

Circumstances where disclosure will not be made. 

Among the demands in response to which disclosure will not be authorized by the Chief Counsel are those demands with
respect to which any of the following factors exist: 

(1) Disclosure would violate a treaty, statute (such as the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C.
6103 and 7213), or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, Fed. R. Crim. Proc. rule 6(e) (18 U.S.C. App.);


(2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation; 

(3) Disclosure would reveal classified or confidential information; 

(4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant; 

(5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, interfere with enforcement
proceedings, or disclose investigative techniques and procedures; 
(6) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets without the owner's consent; 

(7) Disclosure relates to documents which were produced by another agency or entity; 

(8) Disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of Customs business; or 

(9) Customs has no interest, records, or other official information regarding the matter in which disclosure is sought.




&sect;103.24

 Procedure in the event a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.




If response to a demand is required before the instructions from the Chief Counsel are received, the U.S. Attorney,
his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall be requested to appear with the Customs employee
upon whom the demand has been made. The U.S. Attorney, his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative
shall furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this subpart, inform the court
or other authority that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of

&sect;103.25 

Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling. 



If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in accordance
with &sect;103.22 of this chapter pending receipt of instructions, or if the court or other authority rules that the
demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions rendered in accordance with &sect;&sect;103.22, 103.23,
103.26, and 103.27 of this subpart not to produce the documents or disclose the information sought, the Customs employee
upon whom the demand has been made shall, pursuant to this subpart, respectfully decline to comply with the demand.


See, United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 

340 U.S. 462 (1951).



&sect;103.26

 Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a state or local criminal proceeding. 



Customs Regional Commissioners, special agents in charge, and chiefs of field laboratories may, in the interest
of federal, state, and local law enforcement, upon receipt of demands of state or local authorities, and at the expense
of the state, authorize employees under their supervision to attend trials and administrative hearings on behalf
of the government in any state or local criminal case, to produce records, and to testify as to facts coming to their
knowledge in their official capacities. However, in cases where a defendant in a state or local criminal case demands
testimony or the production of customs documents or information, authorization from the Chief Counsel or his/her
designees is required as under &sect;103.22 of this subpart. No disclosure of information under this section shall
be made if any of the factors listed in &sect;103.23(b) of this subpart are present. 



&sect;103.27

 Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a foreign proceeding where Customs is not a party. 



(a) 

Required prior approval for disclosure. 

In any foreign proceeding in which the Customs Service is not a party, no Customs employee shall, in response to a demand,
furnish Customs documents or testimony as to any material contained in Customs files, any information relating to
or based upon material contained in Customs files, or any information or material acquired as part of the performance
of that person's official duties (or because of that person's official status) without the prior approval of the Office
of the Chief Counsel, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. 

(b) 

Employee notification to Counsel. 

Whenever a demand in a foreign proceeding is made upon a Customs employee concerning pre-clearance activities within
the territory of the foreign country, that party shall immediately notify the Regional or District Counsel for the
region or district having jurisdiction over the pre-clearance location. All other demands in a foreign proceeding
shall be reported by Customs employees to the Office of the Chief Counsel at Headquarters. The party shall await instructions
from either the Regional/District Counsel or the Office of Chief Counsel, or their designees, concerning the appropriate
response to the demand. 

(c) 

Counsel notification to originating component. 

Upon receipt of a demand, the Chief Counsel shall immediately acknowledge its receipt to the originating component.


(d) 

Conditions for authorization of disclosure. 

The Chief Counsel, subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this section, may authorize the disclosure of Customs documents
or the appearance and testimony of a Customs employee if: 

(1) There is no objection after inquiry of the originating component; 

(2) The disclosure, in the judgment of the Chief Counsel, is appropriate under the factors specified in &sect;103.23(a)
of this subpart; and 

(3) The disclosure, in the judgment of the Chief Counsel, is consistent with the factors specified in &sect;103.23(b)
of this subpart. 

(e) 

Limitations on the scope of authorized disclosure. 

The Chief Counsel shall, following any necessary consultation with the originating component, authorize the disclosure
of Customs information by a Customs employee without further authorization from Customs officials whenever possible:


Provided, 

that, when the information demanded relates to that collected, assembled, or prepared in connection with litigation
or an investigation supervised by a Customs Office, Chief Counsel, prior to authorizing such disclosure, seeks to
limit the demand to that which would be consistent with the factors specified in &sect;103.23 of this subpart. The
Chief Counsel shall seek to limit the demand through negotiation with appropriate authority.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 11, 1994, OSHA announced that it had established the Steel Erection Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee
(SENRAC) (59 FR 24389) in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Negotiated Rulemaking Act
of 1990 (NRA) and section 7(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) to resolve issues associated with
the development of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Steel Erection. Appointees to the Committee include representatives
from labor, industry, public interests and government agencies.




The first two SENRAC meetings were held in Bethesda, Maryland on June 14&hyph;16, 1994 and in Denver, Colorado on July
11&hyph;13, 1994. The Committee established workgroups to address issues on fall protection, allocation of responsibility,
construction specifications, and scope of the standard. Also, the Committee groundrules were formally adopted.
At the third meeting, held in Boston, Massachusetts on August 16&hyph;18, 1994, the Committee determined that the
proper allocation of responsibility for safety should be evaluated for all construction activities, not just for
steel erection, and that any Committee recommendation to OSHA on this issue will be independent of its consensus recommendations
for subpart R. Also, the Committee addressed the scope of subpart R to determine whether it will apply to erection activities
other than steel buildings. These issues will be addressed again at the September 20&hyph;22 meeting in Washington,
DC and the Committee acknowledged that all affected interests should actively participate in these discussions.

Agendas for the meetings are as follows:

Washington, DC (September 20&hyph;22): On September 20th, OSHA will make a presentation to the full Committee regarding
the economic considerations involved in this rulemaking followed by a meeting of the Fall Protection workgroup.
The September 21st meeting will begin with a full Committee discussion of the scope of the standard, addressing whether
certain erection activities should be covered (i.e., precast concrete, towers and bridges). A meeting of the Allocation
of Responsibility workgroup will follow. This workgroup session will include discussions with representatives
of building owners and general contractors to determine the proper allocation of safety responsibility among all
parties involved in the construction process. The afternoon session will consist of a meeting of the Construction
Specifications workgroup and presentations on this subject. The Construction Specifications discussions will
continue on the morning of September 22nd and will be followed by a full Committee meeting.

St. Louis (November 8&hyph;10): To be determined at the September 20&hyph;22 meeting in Washington.

Washingtion, DC (December 6&hyph;8): To be determined at the November 8&hyph;10 meeting in St. Louis.

All interested parties are invited to attend both the workgroup and full Committee meetings at the times and places
indicated above. No advanced registration is required. Seating will be available to the public on a first-come, first-served
basis. Individuals with disabilities wishing to attend should contact the Facilitator to obtain appropriate accommodations.

During the meeting, members of the general public may request permission to informally address the full Committee
and workgroups.

Minutes of the meetings and materials prepared for the Committee will be available for public inspection at the OSHA
Docket Office, N&hyph;2625, 200 Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210; Telephone (202) 219&hyph;7894.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Kentucky Program 



On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Background information
on the Kentucky program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of
approval can be found in the May 18, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 21404). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30
CFR 917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16, and 917.17.

II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated August 1, 1994, (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1305) Kentucky submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Kentucky submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions
of the regulations that Kentucky proposes to amend are 405 KAR 16:010 and 405 KAR 18:010.

At 405 KAR 16:010, Kentucky is requiring that surface mining activities not remove coal from outcrop barrier pillars
left by underground mining, except in those circumstances where removal would have certain beneficial effects.
State approval is required. Kentucky may approve the removal if it makes certain determinations that the removal
would: (1) Completely eliminate existing underground workings, thereby eliminating all adverse conditions that
might result from the underground workings; (2) eliminate or significantly reduce a threat to the health and safety
of the public resulting from the underground workings; or (3) eliminate or significantly reduce existing or potential
adverse impacts of the underground workings to the quantity or quality of ground or surface water.

At 405 KAR 18:010, Kentucky is requiring that where the coal seam approaches the land surface, the underground mine
must leave an unmined section of coal to create an outcrop barrier pillar. The pillar must be of sufficient width to
support the overburden and prevent failure and sudden release of water due to water pressure against the outcrop barrier
pillar. The State may determine the width of the outcrop barrier on a case-by-case basis. If the coal dips toward the
land surface, the width must not be less than the width given by the formula: W = 50 + H, where W is the minimum barrier width
in feet and H is the maximum hydrostatic head in feet that can build up on the outcrop barrier pillar.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Kentucky program.



Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Lexington Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or
included in the Administrative Record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4:00 p.m., [E.D.T.] on September 21, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons
requesting the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to speak at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard.



Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES. 

A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778

The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida for the
purpose of revising biological waste and crematory regulations. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the
direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested
in commenting on this document should do so at this time.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 To be considered, comments must be received by October 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background


Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing
to NAAQS nonattainment, to track these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented
that reduce emissions and move areas towards attainment. The CAAA require ozone nonattainment areas designated
as moderate, serious, severe, and extreme to submit a plan within three years of 1990 to reduce volatile organic compounds
(VOC) emissions by 15 percent within six years after 1990. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent
reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and to
exclude certain emission reductions not creditable towards the 15 percent. The 1990 base year emissions inventory
is the primary inventory from which the periodic inventory, the Reasonable Further Progress projection inventory,
and the modeling inventory are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purpose can be found in
the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991. The base
year inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as moderate and above outside
transport regions.
The air quality planning requirements for marginal to extreme ozone nonattainment areas are set out in section 182(a)&hyph;(e)
of title I of the CAAA. The EPA has issued a General Preamble describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends
to review SIP revisions submitted under title I, including requirements for the preparation of the 1990 base year
inventory (see 57 FR 13502; April 16, 1992, and 57 FR 18070; April 28, 1992). Because the EPA is describing its interpretations
here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble (57 FR 18070, Appendix B, April 28, 1992) for
a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale.
In today's rulemaking action on the Texas ozone base year emissions inventories, the EPA is proposing to apply its
interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, the EPA will consider any
comments submitted within the comment period before taking final action on today's proposal.

Those States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal to extreme are required under section
182(a)(1) of the 1990 CAAA to submit a final, comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone season,
weekday emissions from all sources by 
November 15, 1992. This inventory is for calendar year 1990 and is denoted as the base year inventory. It includes both
anthropogenic and biogenic sources of VOC, nitrogen oxides (NO

x

), and carbon monoxide (CO). The inventory is to address actual VOC, NO

x

, and CO emissions for the area during a peak ozone season, which is generally comprised of the summer months. All stationary
point and area sources, as well as highway mobile sources within the nonattainment area, are to be included in the compilation.
Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16,
1992). 


Emission inventories are first reviewed under the completeness criteria established under section 110(k)(1) of
the CAAA (56 FR 42216, August 26, 1991). According to section 110(k)(1)(C), if a submittal does not meet the completeness
criteria, ``the State shall be treated as not having made the submission.'' Under sections 179(a)(1) and 110(c)(1),
a finding by the EPA that a submittal is incomplete is one of the actions that initiates the sanctions and Federal Implementation
Plan processes (see David Mobley memorandum, November 12, 1992).

Analysis of State Submission 


1. Procedural Background 




The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing emission inventory submissions
to the EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each emission inventory submitted by a State must be adopted
after reasonable notice and public hearing.

2

 Final approval of the inventory will not occur until the State revises the inventory to address public comments. Changes
to the inventory that impact the 15 percent reduction calculation and require a revised control strategy will constitute
a SIP revision. The EPA created a ``de minimis'' exception to the public hearing requirement for minor changes. The
EPA defines ``

de minimis

'' for such purposes to be those in which the 15 percent reduction calculation and the associated control strategy
or the maintenance plan showing do not change. States will aggregate all such ``de minimis'' changes together when
making the determination as to whether the change constitutes a SIP revision. The State will need to make the change
through a formal SIP revision process, in conjunction with the change to the control measure or other SIP programs.

3

 Section 110(a)(2) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State
under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

Base-Year Emission Inventories for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide Nonattainment Areas,'' September 29, 1992. 



</FOOTNOTE>


The State of Texas submitted the 1990 base year inventories for Houston/Galveston (HGA), Beaumont/Port Arthur (BPA),
El Paso (ELP), and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) on November 17, 1992, as a SIP revision by cover letter from the Governor.
The inventories were reviewed by the EPA to determine completeness shortly after their submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).
The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating
the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 
The State of Texas subsequently held public hearings to entertain public comment on the 1990 base year emission inventories.
The hearing for the HGA area was held on August 5, 1993, in Houston, Texas. The hearing for the BPA area was held on August
6, 1993, in Beaumont, Texas. The hearing for the ElP area was held on August 4, 1993, in El Paso, Texas; and the hearing
for the DFW area was held on August 7, 1993, in Arlington, Texas. The State provided evidence to EPA Region 6 that the
public hearings were held and that the State responded to comments. The inventories were approved by the Texas Air
Control Board (TACB) on November 10, 1993. 


On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
(TNRCC), and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind
any rules, regulations, orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB.

Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of base year emission inventory submittals
in order to determine approval or disapproval under section 182(a)(1) (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566, April 16, 1992).
The EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Texas ozone base year emissions inventories based on the Level I, II, and
III review findings. This section outlines the review procedures performed to determine if the base year emission
inventory is acceptable or is disapproved. 

Today's action describes the review procedures associated with determining the acceptability of a 1990 base year
emission inventory, and discusses the levels of acceptance that can result from the findings of the review process.




A. The Following Discussion Reviews the State Base Year SIP Inventory Approval Requirements 



The Level I and II review process is used to determine that all components of the base year inventory are present. The
review also evaluates the level of supporting documentation provided by the State, and assesses whether the emissions
were developed according to current EPA guidance. 

The Level III review process outlined below consists of 10 points that the inventory must include. For a base year emission
inventory to be acceptable, it must pass all of the following acceptance criteria: 

1. An approved Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) was provided, and the Quality Assurance (QA) program contained in
the IPP was performed and its implementation documented. 

2. Adequate documentation was provided that enabled the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures
and the data sources used to develop the inventory. 

3. The point source inventory must be complete. 

4. Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current EPA guidance. 

5. The area source inventory must be complete. 

6. The area source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current EPA guidance. 

7. Biogenic emissions must have been prepared according to current EPA guidance or another approved technique. 

8. The method (e.g., Highway Performance Monitoring System or a network transportation planning model) used to develop
vehicle miles travelled (VMT) estimates must follow EPA guidance, which is detailed in the document, ``Procedures
for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office
of Mobile Sources and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina, December 1992. The VMT development methods were adequately described and documented in the inventory
report. 

9. The MOBILE model (or EMFAC model for California only) was correctly used to produce emission factors for each of
the vehicle classes. 

10. Nonroad mobile emissions were prepared according to current EPA guidance for all of the source categories. 

The base year emission inventory will be approved if it passes Levels I, II, and III of the review process. Detailed
Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following document: ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventories'', U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum
from David Mobley and G.T. Helms to the Regions, ``1990 O

B. The Following is a Summary of the Review of the Texas 1990 Base Year Submittal. 



The TACB submitted the HGA, BPA, ELP, and DFW inventories on November 17, 1992. EPA Region 6, EPA's Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards Emissions Inventory Branch, EPA's Office of Mobile Sources (OMS), and contractor's reviewed
the inventories. Comments were sent to the TACB, and the TACB responded with a resubmittal. The resubmittal underwent
a second review. The review directive comments were given to Texas and discussed during an on-site visit to Austin,
Texas, on September 2, 1993. 

Texas addressed the final directive comments and the OMS comments and submitted revised submittal documentation
to Region 6 on October 25, 1993, along with documents responding to the directive comments and the OMS comments. Region
6 compared the Texas responses with the deficiencies noted in the final directive review and OMS comments and concluded
that Texas had adequately addressed the remaining deficiencies so that Region 6 could verify that Texas had satisfied
the Level III criteria for the HGA, BPA, ELP, and DFW ozone nonattainment areas.

Based on Region 6's Level III review, Texas has satisfied all of the EPA's requirements for purposes of providing a
comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions in the ozone nonattainment areas. A summary
of Region 6's Level III review is given below: 

1. The IPP and QA plan were submitted and approved. The QA plan was implemented and documented in the submission. 

2. The documentation was adequate for the reviewer to determine the estimation procedures and data sources used to
develop the inventory for all emission types. 

3. The point source inventory was found to be complete. 

4. The point source emissions were estimated according to EPA guidance. 

5. The area source inventory was found to be complete. 

6. The area source emissions were estimated according to EPA guidance. 

7. The biogenic emissions were calculated using the EPA PC&hyph;BEIS model. 

8. The method used to develop VMT estimates was adequately described and documented. 

9. The MOBILE model was used correctly. 

10. The nonroad mobile emission estimates were correctly prepared according to current EPA guidance. 

Documentation of the Region 6 evaluation, including details of the review procedure, is contained in a memorandum
(Attachment A) in the Technical Support Document (TSD). A general summary of the inventories is contained in Attachment
B of the TSD. 



Proposed Action 



The EPA is proposing to fully approve the SIP 1990 base year ozone emission inventories submitted to the EPA for the
Houston/Galveston, Beaumont/Port Arthur, El Paso, and Dallas/Fort Worth areas on November 17, 1993, as meeting
the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act. 

The State has submitted complete inventories containing point, area, biogenic, on-road, and non-road mobile source
data, and accompanying documentation. Emissions from these sources are presented in the following tables:

These inventories are complete and approvable according to the criteria set out in the November 12, 1992, memorandum
from J. David Mobley, Chief Emission Inventory Branch, TSD and G. T. Helms, Chief Ozone/Carbon Monoxide Programs
Branch, Air Quality Management Division. 

The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 CAAA of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Request for Public Comments 



The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, the
EPA will consider any comments received by October 6, 1994. 



Regulatory Flexibility 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. (

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to redesignate the Huntington, West Virginia area from moderate ozone nonattainment to attainment
and proposes to approve the maintenance plan as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). In the final rules
section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be
withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.
EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to combine the clauses at 52.210&hyph;5 and 52.210&hyph;7 as an acquisition
streamlining measure. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant
to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments should be submitted on or before November 7, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule.




</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS),
18th &amp; F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92-44 in all correspondence related
to this case.



</ADDRESS>

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Mr. Jack O'Neill at (202) 501&hyph;3856 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


A. Background




The clauses at FAR 52.210&hyph;5, New Material, and at FAR 52.210&hyph;7, Used or Reconditioned Material, Residual
Inventory, and Former Government Surplus Property, address the condition of material to be furnished under Government
contracts. This proposed rule adds the requirements of the clause at 52.210&hyph;7 to the clause at 52.210&hyph;5
and revises the title of the clause to read ``Acceptable Material''. Corresponding changes are made to the clause
prescription at FAR 10.011(e).



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq., 

because the rule merely rearranges and clarifies existing requirements. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such
comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq. 

(FAR case 92&hyph;44), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paper Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et

 

seq.

Federal Acquisition Regulation; Use of Convict Labor



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to remove all references to 18 U.S.C. 4082(c)(2), include the stipulation
required by Executive Order 11755, as amended, in the clause for the convenience of users of the FAR, and add the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands to the covered jurisdictions as required by Executive Order 12608. This regulatory
action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated
September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments should be submitted on or before November 7, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS),
18th &amp; F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;615 in all correspondence
related to this case.



</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Mr. Jack O'Neill at (202) 501&hyph;3856 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat,
Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;615.


</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


A. Background



A statutory provision (18 U.S.C. 4082(c)(2)), which is cited both in section 22.201 and in the clause at section 52.222&hyph;3,
now applies only to offenses committed prior to November 1, 1987, and there is no statutory or Executive Order requirement
to include it in the FAR. In addition, Executive Order 12608 adds the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
to the jurisdictions covered by Executive Order 11755, which the FAR text and clause implement.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because it merely deletes an unnecessary statutory reference and adds one jurisdiction (the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands) to the coverage of the clause at 52.222&hyph;3. It also includes the stipulation required
by Executive Order 11755, as amended, in the clause itself, which should be more convenient for users of the FAR but
is not a substantial change. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments
are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subparts will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and
should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 93&hyph;615), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 54 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

PART 22_APPLICATION OF LABOR LAWS TO GOVERNMENT ACQUISITIONS



2. Section 22.201 is revised to read as follows:



22.201

General.



(a) Executive Order 11755, December 29, 1973, as amended by Executive Order 12608, September 9, 1987, states: ``The
development of the occupational and educational skills of prison inmates is essential to their rehabilitation and
to their ability to make an effective return to free society. Meaningful employment serves to develop those skills.
It is also true, however, that care must be exercised to avoid either the exploitation of convict labor or any unfair
competition between convict labor and free labor in the production of goods and services.'' The Executive order does
not prohibit the contractor, in performing the contract, from employing_

(1) Persons on parole or probation;

(2) Persons who have been pardoned or who have served their terms;

(3) Federal prisoners; or

(4) Nonfederal prisoners authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws of a jurisdiction listed
in the Order if_

(i) The worker is paid or is in an approved work training program on a voluntary basis;

(ii) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted;

(iii) Paid employment will not

(A) Result in the displacement of employed workers;

(B) Be applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality; or


(C) Impair existing contracts for services;

(iv) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those for work of a similar nature in the
locality where the work is being performed; and

(v) The Attorney General of the United States has certified that the work-release laws or regulations of the jurisdiction
involved are in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 11755, as amended by Executive Order 12608.

(b) Department of Justice regulations authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to exercise the
power and authority vested in the Attorney General by the Order to certify and to revoke the certification of work-release
laws or regulations (see 28 CFR 0.94&hyph;1(b)).



22.202

[Amended]



3. Section 22.202 is amended in the introductory paragraph by inserting after ``Samoa,'' ``the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands,''.



PART 52_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES



4. Section 52.222&hyph;3 is revised to read as follows:



52.222&hyph;3

Convict Labor.



As prescribed in 22.202, insert the following clause:



Convict Labor (Date)



The Contractor agrees not to employ in the performance of this contract any person undergoing a sentence of imprisonment
which has been imposed by any court of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands. This limitation, however, shall not prohibit the employment by the Contractor in the performance of this
contract of persons on parole or probation to work at paid employment during the term of their sentence or persons who
have been pardoned or who have served their terms. Nor shall it prohibit the employment by the Contractor in the performance
of this contract of persons confined for violation of the laws of any of the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands who are authorized to work at paid employment in the community under the laws
of such jurisdiction, if_

(a)(1) The worker is paid or is in an approved work training program on a voluntary basis;

(2) Representatives of local union central bodies or similar labor union organizations have been consulted;

(3) Such paid employment will not result in the displacement of employed workers, or be applied in skills, crafts,
or trades in which there is a surplus of available gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services;
and

(4) The rates of pay and other conditions of employment will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar
nature in the locality in which the work is being performed; and

(b) The Attorney General of the United States has certified that the work-release laws or regulations of the jurisdiction
involved are in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 11755, as amended by Executive Order 12608.

A. Background


The Department of Defense has established the Computer Security Vulnerability Reporting Program (CSVRP) in response
to national security instructions. Under this program the Defense Information Systems Security Program Office
has established the Automated System Security Incident Support Team (ASSIST) whose mission is vulnerability reporting.
ASSIST has recommended all DOD elements include a clause in all contracts for computer hardware or software to protect
against delivery of contaminated or malicious code. DMA proposes the use of Agency clause 5252.246&hyph;9000 ``Contaminated
Products''.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act applies, but the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses
and other interested parties. Comments from small entities will also be considered in accordance with Section 610
of the Act.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule contains no information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

On January 11, 1994, the Service received a petition to list the Colton sand dune Jerusalem cricket (

Stenopelmatus 

sp.) as endangered from Dr. David Weissman of the California Academy of Sciences. The letter from Dr. Weissman, dated
January 4, 1994, clearly identified itself as a petition and contained the names, signature, and address of the petitioner.
A letter acknowledging receipt of the petition by the Service was sent to the petitioner on January 31, 1994.

The petitioner stated that the Colton sand dune Jerusalem cricket merits protection under the Act because of: (1)
Threats to its habitat, (2) information indicating that this insect is known from only two sand dune areas in southwestern
San Bernardino County, California, and (3) the cricket occurs in the same habitat as the federally listed endangered
species Delhi Sands flower-loving fly (

Rhaphiomidas terminatus abdominalis

).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940906-1-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940906-1-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Service's finding is based on information contained in the petition, conversations with the petitioner, and
additional information provided to the Service by the petitioner in a letter dated March 29, 1994. All documents are
on file in the Carlsbad Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section).

Adequate rangewide surveys have not been completed for the Colton sand dune Jerusalem cricket. The Service lacks
evidence of specific threats to the petitioned insect, especially any threat associated with a population decline.
The insect covered by this petition may be sensitive to ecological perturbations resulting from the impacts of human
activities. However, information was not presented to show correlations between the insect's ecological sensitivity
and population trends. No information exists to support an assumption that the Colton sand dune Jerusalem cricket
has been substantially depleted or is subject to serious threats throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Moreover, given that the insect has yet to be formally described, the taxonomic distinctiveness or validity of the
species has not been determined.

The Service has carefully reviewed the petition. On the basis of the best scientific and commercial information currently
available, the Service has determined that the petition does not present substantial information indicating that
the requested action may be warranted. However, the Service is interested in any additional information about the
Colton sand dune Jerusalem cricket that may be available. Please submit any additional information to the Carlsbad
Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES
or the Convention, is an international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in certain animal
and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention.
Currently, 122 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the
Conference of the Parties which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland
to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented
by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. The ninth regular
meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (COP9) will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 7&hyph;18,
1994.

This notice is part of a series of notices which, together with public meetings, encourage the public to participate
in the development of the U.S. positions for COP9. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38112) requested information and comments from the public on animal or plant
species the United States might consider as possible amendments to the appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60873) requested public comments on possible revisions to the criteria
for listing species in the CITES Appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) requested additional comments from the public on animal or plant
species that the United States was considering submitting as amendments to the appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4094): (1) published the time and place for COP9; (2) announced a public
meeting for February 22, 1994, to discuss the 31st meeting of the CITES Standing Committee; (3) detailed the provisional
agenda of the COP; and (4) requested information and comments from the public on possible COP9 agenda items and resolutions
that the United States might submit. Five proposed species amendments, three resolutions and two agenda items were
submitted by the Service and received by the CITES Secretariat on June 10, 1994, the deadline for consideration at
COP9. Additional information on these topics will be published in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice.

This notice announces proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States for consideration at the forthcoming
meeting of the Parties and sets forth tentative negotiating positions of the United States on foreign proposals.
CITES regulates import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of certain animal and plant species. Species
for which trade is controlled are included in three appendices. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction
that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with
extinction may become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also includes species that must be subject
to regulation in order that trade in other currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective
control (e.g., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of currently or potentially threatened species
from those of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party nation identifies as being subject to regulation
within its jurisdiction for purposes of preventing or restricting exploitation, and for which it needs the cooperation
of other Parties in controlling trade.

Any Party nation may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at the meetings of the Conference
of the Parties. The text of any proposal must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before the meeting.
The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate
their responses and the Secretariat's own findings and recommendations to all Parties no later than 30 days before
the meeting. Amendments to the Appendices are adopted by a two-thirds majority of the Parties present and voting.



Information Sought



The Service solicits comments on its tentative negotiating positions on proposed species amendments submitted
by Parties other than the United States. Information is also sought on the biological status of the affected species,
on the amount and type of trade in specimens of the species, and on the impact of trade on their populations, especially
as it relates to any potential effects on survival of the species in all or parts of its range. Comments that provide
this information based on the criteria for adding or removing species from the appendices would be especially helpful.
The Service will solicit comments on U.S. positions for the remaining items on the agenda for COP9, other than proposed
amendments to the appendices, in a subsequent 

Federal Register

 notice.

The Service has based its present tentative negotiating positions mainly on the review of information presented
in the proposals submitted by proponents and in terms of criteria adopted at previous meetings of the Conference of
the Parties of CITES. Some of the proposals will have to be translated into English from Spanish (English translation
available) or French (also official languages under terms of the Convention). Because information provided in some
of the proposals or otherwise available to the Service is too incomplete to allow a thorough review of their merits,
several of the tentative negotiating positions presented may be revised as additional biological and trade data
are obtained. Final guidance for the delegation is to be based on the best available biological and trade information,
including comments received in response to this notice.


Proposals 


In accordance with the provisions of Article XV, paragraph 1(a) of the Convention the following CITES Parties have
submitted proposals for changes to Appendices I and II of the Convention: Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Benin,
Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Kenya, Madagascar, Mexico, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Tanzania, United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay, and Vietnam. Proposals submitted by the United States will be discussed
in a subsequent 

Federal Register

 notice.
A total of 92 proposals on both plant and animal species were submitted by countries other than the United States, including
10 proposals that were submitted based on the ``Ten Year Review'' concept first adopted at the 1981 Conference of the
Parties in New Delhi, India. The Ten Year Review process seeks to correct or clarify the inclusion of species listed
at the Plenipotentiary and COPI before listing criteria were adopted. Some of the proposals submitted by Switzerland
under this process recommend the deletion from the appendices of those species that have not been reported in trade,
unless the species should be included in Appendix II because of similarity in appearance to related taxa that do appear
in trade.
It is the U.S. position (and has been at earlier COPs) that the lack of reported trade for some species should not be the
sole basis for their deletion from the appendices. The lack of reported trade for some species proposed for deletion
from the appendices may be due to (1) their rarity, (2) the possibility that their listing in the appendices has appropriately
inhibited trade, (3) effective limits on trade by range States for the benefit of the species in that the range States
may determine that trade would be detrimental to the survival of the species, or (4) the lack of proper documentation
on the reporting of trade. Consequently, the Service does not believe that lack of appearance in trade is, by itself,
a sufficient reason to warrant the removal of a taxon from the appendices. In establishing a tentative negotiating
position on these ``Ten Year Review'' delisting proposals, the Service considered the degree of vulnerability of
the species and the likelihood of it entering trade, and the net conservation effect of delisting. 
In addition to the regular listing, delisting, and transfer proposals, Switzerland, in carrying out its responsibility
as the CITES Depository Government, submitted proposals to transfer some populations from Appendix II to Appendix
I (as required by earlier COPs). These proposals provide the basis for Parties to act on their previously stated intentions
to return species to Appendix I if range countries do not submit, or Parties do not adopt, appropriate amendments to
retain designated populations of certain species on Appendix II under provisions of Conf. 3.15 on ranching, Conf.
7.14 on export quotas, or Conf. 8.22 on ranching for crocodilians. Such is the case for some populations of crocodiles
presently on Appendix II under special provisions. However, for those populations for which ranching proposals
or export proposals have been submitted, and if adopted by the Parties, Switzerland intends to withdraw its proposed
amendment to transfer these populations to Appendix I.
Proposals submitted by Parties other than the United States are listed in the following table. Tentative negotiating
positions and the basis for making them also are indicated. These positions were taken largely on the basis of the information
contained in the proposals unless the Service has information on the species in its files, particularly from earlier
COPs or meetings of permanent CITES committees. If insufficient population and/or trade information was provided,
the Service's position is usually to oppose the proposal, pending the receipt of further information and a review
of the relevant scientific literature. The complete text of each proposal received is available for public inspection
at the Service's Office of Scientific Authority (see addresses above). The text of any referenced resolution from
previous meetings of the Conference of the Parties is available from the Service's Office of Scientific Authority
or Office of Management Authority.
Proposed amendments and the Service's tentative position are as follows:

Parts and Derivatives Proposal with respect to Appendix II plant taxa replace the standard exclusions: ``tissue

in sterile culture media, either liquid or solid, transported in containers commonly used for this type of cultures,
with different shapes and made of different materials''
Germany
Support

1The listing, uplisting, downlisting, or delisting of the taxon, as proposed, appears to be justified by the biological
status and trade information in the proposal or currently available to the Service.

2Limited population status and trade information is given, but the United States will give strong consideration
to the positions of range State(s).

3The listing of this taxon, as proposed, appears to be justified by the trade information and/or the similarity of
appearance concern.

4Although this proposal was not formerly submitted pursuant to the ten-year review resolution for downlisting,
this proposal appears to be justified under such provisions.


5These species of chinchilla occurring in South America are presently listed in Appendix I and are classified as rare,
vulnerable or endangered by IUCN. Complete removal of protection for captive-bred forms of these species potentially
places wild populations at risk. However, a downlisting of the captive populations in South America to Appendix II
may be appropriate.

6The United States continues to support the 1978 request from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to take
all possible measures to support the IWC ban on commercial whaling for certain species and stocks of whales and therefore
opposes the transfer of the minke whale from Appendix I to II.

7Trade information considered insufficient, and trade of species occurring in the United States does not appear
to warrant listing the entire genus. Five species identified in Mammals Checklist of the World by Wilson and Reeder
(1993) including two, 

C. leuconotus 

and 

C. mesoleucus, 

that occur in southwestern part of the United States.

a

The Service believes that in order for the African countries to maintain sustainable populations of African elephants,
the people in those countries must realize both consumptive and nonconsumptive benefits from this natural resource.
The proposal as written, however, does not obligate South Africa to obtain approval from the CITES Parties before
trading in ivory after COP10, and the United States does not support reopening the ivory trade. A Panel of Experts established
under the provisions of resolution Conf. 7.9 is reviewing in-country trade controls. The U.S. will develop its position
after receipt of the Panel's report.

8

b

This proposal would allow legal trade in rhino horn products, albeit with strict in-country controls, and such trade
is premature until illegal trade is under control.

9This proposal does not meet trade control provisions outlined in resolution Conf. 7.9.

10The Service is concerned that no information has been presented to show that the vicuna populations on Appendix
II have benefited from the harvest now proposed for all populations. The Service is also concerned about a request
in the proposal to market internationally both wool from live vicunas and wool from warehoused stocks. No trade controls
such as those proposed by Chile are proposed to ensure that illegal wool does not enter trade.

11Export of fiber and reimport of processed fiber could be monitored to control inclusion of illegal fiber in any significant
amount. No downlisting of Appendix I populations is proposed, as with the Peruvian proposal.

12The population-status information is not sufficient to warrant the listing, uplisting, downlisting, or delisting
as proposed.

13These entities are listed as a single species 

Anas nesiotas 

in CITES-adopted checklist and the subspecies 

Anas aucklandica nesiotas 

is already on Appendix I. Consider recommendation of the Nomenclature Committee as to whether to list as a single or
as three species.

14The Service is concerned with the methodology used in the study on which this proposal is based and understands that
this study is being reviewed by IUCN peer group.

15While the biological status and trade information supports this proposal, the ``species'' is considered to be
a color morph of 

C. auriceps 

in the CITES-adopted checklist. Therefore, consider the recommendation of the Nomenclature Committee.

16While the Service has a tentative position to support this proposal, the final position will depend in part upon
the proponent providing specific procedures and regulations for licensing and inspection commitments and specific
details for long-term population monitoring program.

17The Service remains concerned about the management and enforcement, including but not limited to the considerations
presented in footnote 18a.

18

a

The transfer of certain crocodilian populations from Appendix I to II was proposed pursuant to Conf. 3.15 (ranching)
or Conf. 7.4 (export quota). The Service's initial support of these proposals is contingent upon assurance that (1)
annual reports are being regularly filed with the CITES Secretariat by the proponent, (2) there is an adequate basis
to monitor the status of wild populations, (3) animals will be returned to the wild in numbers as appropriate, and (4)
there is an implementable limit on the harvest of wild juveniles and adults.

18

b

The Service supports continuation of Appendix II listing under Conf. 3.15 but opposes expansion of wild harvest quotas
beyond currently authorized levels without additional justification.

19Switzerland, as depository government, proposed the transfer from Appendix II to I of those species that were downlisted
from Appendix I to II under the provisions of Conf. 7.14. If ranching or export quota proposals are adopted by the Parties,
Switzerland will withdraw its proposal for those populations.

20Support for this proposal is conditioned upon the inclusion of the entire species 

L. punctata 

in Appendix II.

21The United States submitted a similar proposal for this genus, but was able to include more recent information in
its proposal, a copy of which is available from either the Office of Management Authority or Office of Scientific Authority.

22Support for this proposal is based on trade levels and the historical effects of trade on other populations or the
reproductive characteristics of the species. However, the Service will consider any new population information.

23The Service considers this species to be included in Appendix I already, based on the present listing. The report
of the Nomenclature Committee supports this position, and, if adopted, will render the New Zealand proposal redundant.
Should another species of tuatara be described, adding 

S. guntheri 

would add confusion to any listing of all tuataras on Appendix I.

24Although this is proposed as a tentative transfer to Appendix II until the next COP, the Service's position has been
not to support the commercial sale of confiscated specimens of Appendix I species.

25The Service would support listing of this taxon in Appendix I on the basis of resolution Conf. 2.19 (i.e., due to the
taxon's rarity, and because any trade in this taxon would be detrimental).

26Malaysia has had a captive breeding facility registered for this species in accordance with Article VII paragraph
4 and pursuant to resolution Conf. 8.15. Indonesia is proposing to register similar facilities but to date these have
not been accepted by the CITES Secretariat. In the absence of the registration of one or more facilities in Indonesia,
this proposal by Indonesia would preclude commercial trade in this species. Therefore, Indonesia may wish to consider
modifying their proposal to continue the present downlisting to Appendix II pursuant to Conf. 7.14 with an export
quota.

27The trade concern is the export of the ``wood-rose,'' which may or may not be legally included under CITES by listing


Dactylanthus taylorii, 

because the ``wood-rose'' is tissue of various common host trees or shrubs that has been wholly transformed by the
action of 

D. taylorii.

28Berberis aristata 

of authors not de Candolle=

B. chitria 

(and/or 

B. floribunda

).

29The downlisting of this taxon appears to be unjustified, because of similarity-of-appearance concerns for the
remaining dwarf taxa of subgenus 

Lacanthis.

30Trade information considered insufficient.

31The United States would want this proposal amended to exclude musical instruments. This species is often called
African blackwood; although in the proposal one of the common names mentioned is African ebony, true ebony including
African ebony normally are regarded to be species of Diospyros.

32The listing of this taxon appears to be justified; similarity-of-appearance also is a concern.

33The proposal is in error in not treating Aloe barbadensis 

as a synonym of 

Aloe vera. 

The parts and derivatives of artificially propagated 

Aloe vera 

already are not regulated by CITES. The Service is considering whether artificially propagated whole plants of 

Aloe vera 

can be dealt with in a better way, without putting wild 

Aloe 

taxa at increased risk.


34The United States expects to receive information regarding this species and its trade at a meeting of the Linnean
Society on September 8, 1994. Information from range States and import data are also being sought and considered.
Note that hybrids between 

Swietenia macrophylla 

and 

S. mahagoni 

are spontaneous but are not natural hybrids in terms of Resolution Conf. 2.13; they sometimes occur where 

S. macrophylla 

has been introduced by people into proximity with 

S. mahagoni. 

If the United States were to support this proposal, it would want it amended to exclude parts and derivatives other
than saw logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and perhaps plywood sheets.

Future Actions



The Service will announce in the 

Federal Register

 the revised provisional agenda and working program for COP9 and resolutions submitted by the Parties. That 

Federal Register

 notice will present the Service's tentative negotiating positions on these agenda items and resolutions.

The Nomenclature Committee, in conjunction with the Wildlife trade Monitoring Unit, has been working to review and
resolve numerous ambiguities in the Appendices that arose from the listing of taxa at the plenipotentiary and first
meetings of the Conference of the Parties. Supporting documents were not a matter of record at these initial meetings.
In addition, accepted names for those originally listed taxa have changed in some instances. The Nomenclature Committee
has submitted a list of such clarifications to the CITES Secretariat for consideration by the Parties at COP9. A copy
of this report is available from the Office of Scientific Authority.

The next regular meeting of the Parties is scheduled to be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida from November 
7&hyph;18, 1994. The Service will develop final negotiating positions and announce these decisions prior to the
meeting of the Conference of Parties. These negotiating positions will be based upon the best available biological
and trade information, taking into account comments received in response to this notice. If further information
is presented at the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, the U.S. delegation to COP9 will also take it into account in determining
whether the Service's previous positions remain appropriate.



Public Meeting



The Service announces a public meeting on September 14, 1994, from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the Buffet Room adjacent
to the cafeteria of the Department of the Interior, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC. This meeting is being held
to provide information about COP9, and to receive comments from the public on the proposed amendments to the Appendices,
the proposed resolutions, and other agenda items.

This notice was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under EO 12866. This notice was prepared by Drs.
Charles W. Dane, Bruce MacBryde, and Marshall Howe, Office of Scientific Authority, under the authority of the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq).
