ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As part of the Clinton Administration's initiative to help revitalize the airline industry, the Department of Transportation
(the Office of the Secretary and the FAA) is reviewing the 25 year old High Density Traffic Airports Rule (HDR), a regulation
that limits hourly takeoffs and landings (slots) at the following airports: New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy; Chicago's
O'Hare; and Washington, D.C.'s National. The review will be a thorough examination of the slot rule to assess airline
capacity, competition, fares, and service patterns at the four airports. It will also evaluate the rule's economic,
operational and environmental impacts, including the way domestic and international slots are allocated, and will
consider alternative traffic management techniques. On April 1, 1994, the FAA published a request for comments to
gather information on the effectiveness and viability of the HDR and any potential alternatives to the rule (59 FR
15332; Docket No. 27664). The comment period closed on May 27, 1994, and approximately 100 comments have been received.
These public meetings will report study progress and give the public another opportunity to comment on the HDR. If
the results of the review suggest changes to the HDR, those changes would be proposed through the regulatory process,
pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. Changes affecting the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and
landings authorized for air carriers for Washington National Airport would require a legislative change since they
are imposed by statute.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

The public meetings will be held as follows: Washington, DC_Wednesday, October 19, 1994; New York_Friday, October
21, 1994; Chicago_Thursday, November 17, 1994. The meetings will be held from 12 p.m.&hyph;4 p.m. and 6 p.m.&hyph;8
p.m. Persons not able to attend a meeting are invited to provide written comments, which must be received on or before
November 23, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Participation at the Meeting




Requests from persons who wish to present oral statements at the Washington, DC or New York public meetings should
be received by the FAA no later than October 3, 1994. Requests from persons who wish to present oral statements at the
Chicago public meeting should be received by the FAA no later than November 1, 1994. Such request should be submitted
to Cindy Herman, as listed above in the section titled ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''

 and should include at which meeting oral statements will be presented, a written summary of oral remarks to be presented,
and the estimate of time needed for the presentation. Requests received after the date specified above will be scheduled
if there is time available during the meeting. Requests to present oral statements may be made on the day of the public
meetings during the registration period, although time constraints may not permit the accommodation of such requests.
The DOT will prepare an agenda of speakers that will be available at the meeting. The names of those individuals whose
requests to present oral statements are received after the date specified above may not appear on the written agenda.
To accommodate as many speakers as possible, the amount of time allocated to each speaker may be less than the amount
of time requested.



Background





The HDR (14 CFR part 93, Subpart K) was adopted in 1969 as a temporary measure to reduce delays at five congested airports:
JFK International, LaGuardia, Newark International, O'Hare International, and Washington National. Total hourly
limits on the number of operations, or operating ``slots'', were imposed at each airport during certain hours of the
day. For each airport, the hourly total was divided into three operator categories: air carrier, commuter (originally
air taxi), and ``other'', which consists primarily of general aviation and charters. The limits were based on the
Engineering Performance Standards (EPS), which are a method for determining the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operating
capacity of an airport.

All limitations for Newark Airport were removed from the HDR in the early 1970's. The limits were made permanent at
the four other airports in 1973, and have remained in effect in some form since 1969. Between 1981 and 1984, the HDR was
superseded by the Interim Operations Plan adopted in response to the air traffic controllers' strike (SFAR 44). All
SFAR 44 limitations were lifted, and the HDR limitations reinstated, by the ``Interim Final Rule'' issued in March
1984 (49 FR 8237, March 6, 1984). At Washington National Airport, slots are further limited by statute.

The hour and category limits in the HDR are enforced by a regulatory requirement to have an Air Traffic Control reservation
for a takeoff or landing at a high density airport during restricted hours. Air carrier and commuter reservations
are considered slots, which are continuing reservations at the same time each day. ``Other'' category reservations
are allocated on an ad hoc basis for individual operations, using a first-come first-served reservation system.
Reservations are available up to 48 hours in advance of the time of operation by calling a voice-activated computer
system maintained by the FAA Air Traffic System Command Center.



The Study



The review now being conducted by the DOT will include the specific issues for public comment listed below. The requirements
of each of the four airports will be reviewed separately but each airport's relation to the national air traffic system
will be considered. Any changes to the HDR will be subject to the separate process required by the Administrative Procedure
Act. In the case of Washington National, a change to the HDR would also require a statutory change.




Specific Issues for Public Comment



There are several specific issues on which the DOT seeks comment at the public meeting. These key issues are intended
to help focus public comments on areas which will be useful to the DOT in completing its review of the HDR. The comments
at the meetings need not be limited to these issues, and the DOT invites comments on any other aspect of the HDR.

(1) The economic, environmental, competitive, and operational aspects of the HDR at the four airports.

(2) The projected air traffic environment

(3) The process for allocating domestic and international slots

(4) Access for small communities at HDR airports

(5) Potential alternatives to the current regulatory scheme at the HDR airports



Meeting Procedures





The following procedures are established to facilitate the meetings:

(1) There will be no admission fee or other charge to attend or to participate in the meeting. The meeting will be open
to all persons who are scheduled to present statements or who register on the day of the meeting (between 10:45 a.m.
and 11:45 a.m.) subject to availability of space in the meeting rooms. The meetings may adjourn early if scheduled
speakers complete their statements in less time than is scheduled for the meetings.

(2) An individual, whether speaking in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, may be
limited to a 10-minute statement. If possible, we will notify the speaker if additional time is available.

(3) The DOT will try to accommodate all speakers. If the available time does not permit this, speakers generally will
be scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis. However, the DOT reserves the right to exclude some speakers if
necessary to present a balance of viewpoints and issues.

(4) Sign and oral interpretation can be made available at the meeting, as well as an assistive listening device, if
requested 10 calendar days before the meeting.

(5) Representatives of the DOT will preside over the meeting. A panel of DOT and FAA personnel involved in this issue
will be present.

(6) The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the meeting and any material accepted by the DOT
representatives during the meeting will be included in the public docket. Any person who is interested in purchasing
a copy of the transcript should contact the court reporter directly. Additional transcript purchase information
will be available at the meeting.

(7) The DOT will review and consider all material presented by participants at the meeting. Position papers or material
presenting views or arguments related to the HDR may be accepted at the discretion of the presiding officer and subsequently
placed in the public docket. The DOT requests that persons participating in the meeting provide five copies of all
materials to be presented for distribution to the DOT representatives; other copies may be provided to the audience
at the discretion of the participant. 

(8) Statements made by DOT representatives are intended to facilitate discussion of the issues or to clarify issues.
Any statement made during the meeting by a DOT representative is not intended to be, and should not be construed as,
a position of the DOT.

(9) The meetings are designed to solicit public views and more complete information on the HDR and issues discussed
in this notice. Therefore, the meeting will be conducted in an informal and non adversarial manner. No individual
will be subject to cross-examination by any other participant; however, DOT representatives may ask questions to
clarify a statement and to ensure a complete and accurate record.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts miscellaneous amendments to the required IFR (instrument flight rules) altitudes and changeover
points for certain Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes for which a minimum or maximum en route authorized
IFR altitude is prescribed. This regulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the National Airspace
System. These changes are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument
conditions in the affected areas.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR altitudes
governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well as the
changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as prescribed in part 95. The specified
IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation
aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and that is free of frequency interference. The reasons and
circumstances that create the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and operational efficiency
in the National Airspace System, are related to aeronautical charts that are essential to the user, and provide for
the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those various reasons or circumstances require
making this amendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight information
to assure its timely availability to the user. The effective date of this amendment reflects those considerations.
In view of the close and immediate relationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find
that notice and public procedures before adopting this amendment are impracticable and contrary to the public interest
and that good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than 30 days.




The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
dates: 

An effective date for each SIAP is specified in the amendatory provisions.



Incorporation by reference_approved by the Director of the Federal Register on December 31, 1980, and reapproved
as of January 1, 1982.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days. Further,
the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPs. Because of the close and immediate
relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting
these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good
cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' rule under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is approving, with additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the Louisiana regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the ``Louisiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Louisiana
proposed revisions to the Louisiana Surface Mining Regulations (LSMR) pertaining to revegetation success standards
for tree and shrub stocking on lands with a postmining land use of forestry. The amendment specifies revegetation
success standards for final bond release on reclaimed lands developed for forestry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Louisiana Program




On October 10, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Louisiana program. General background
information on the Louisiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the
conditions of approval of the Louisiana program can be found in the October 10, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 67340). Subsequent actions concerning Louisiana's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 918.15
and 918.16.






II. Proposed Amendment





By letter dated May 3, 1994, Louisiana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. LA&hyph;348). Louisiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provision of its
regulatory program that Louisiana proposed to revise was LSMR 53123.B.4.a, standards for success of revegetation
at final bond release on reclaimed lands developed for forestry.




In the May 26, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 27252), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment, provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting
on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. 348.02). Because
no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on June 27, 1994.






During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of LSMR 53123.B.4.a, revegetation
success standards for tree and shrub stocking on lands with a postmining land use of forestry. OSM notified Louisiana
of the concerns by letter dated July 11, 1994 (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.10).



In a letter dated August 16, 1994, Louisiana responded that (1) it would not, at this time, submit revisions in response
to OSM's July 11, 1994, issue letter, and (2) OSM should proceed with the publishing of the final rule 

Federal Register

 notice (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.11).





III. Director's Findings




As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds, with additional requirements,
that the proposed program amendment submitted by Louisiana on May 3, 1994, is no less effective than the requirements
of the corresponding Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.





1. 

LSMR 53123.B.4.a, Standards for Success of Revegetation at Final Bond Release on Reclaimed Lands Developed for Forestry.



a. Revegetation success standards for tree stocking and ground cover. 

Louisiana proposed to revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a to require that prior to final bond release there shall be 450 well-distributed
free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood trees per acre of the same
age, and that countable stems shall be a minimum of 3 years old. At proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a, Louisiana defined ``well-distributed''
to mean uniform stockings levels over an entire planting site, and ``free-to-grow'' to mean pine seedlings or saplings
without significant hardwood competition, competing vegetation shades the pine's crown on less than 30 percent
of the crown's circumference, and the pines are judged to have better than a 90 percent chance of capturing a place in
the crown canopy.

LSMR 53123.B.4.a, which OSM previously approved (October 28, 1992; 57 FR 48726; administrative record No. LA&hyph;350),
requires that vegetative ground cover shall not be less than 70 percent (administrative record Nos. LA&hyph;321
and LA&hyph;350). Louisiana's existing LSMR 53117.A.4, applicable to revegetation on land reclaimed for any land
use, requires that a vegetative cover be established that is capable of stabilizing the soil surface from erosion.
Therefore, the requirement for 70 percent ground cover on land developed for forestry is a minimum standard that must
be increased if it is insufficient to control erosion.

Louisiana stated at proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a that the tree stocking and ground cover standards were developed after
consultation with and approval by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Louisiana submitted to
OSM a letter, dated December 27, 1993, from the Louisiana Office of Forestry, Department of Agriculture and Forestry
(administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.01). In it, the Office of Forestry concurred with the technical success
standards for areas developed for forestry proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(i) and 817.116(b)(3)(i) require that minimum stocking and planting
arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions and after
consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife
programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-specific basis.

Because Louisiana proposed, at LSMR 53123.B.4.a, to specify the minimum stocking and planting arrangements, and
submitted approval by the State agency responsible for the administration of forestry, Louisiana has proposed programwide
standards for all reclaimed land with a designated postmining land use of forestry.

The Director finds that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a is no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(i) and 817.116(b)(3)(i), and approves it.

b. 

Utility of trees for the approved postmining land use and tree health.

 Louisiana proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a to delete the requirements that the trees that will be used in determining
the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall (1) have utility for the approved postmining
land use and (2) be healthy.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii) require (in part) that trees and shrubs
that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall (1) have utility
for the approved postmining land use and (2) be healthy.

Because Louisiana has deleted the State counterparts to the Federal requirements, the Director finds that proposed
LSMR 53123.B.4.a is less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii)
and 817.116(b)(3)(ii). The Director requires that Louisiana revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a to include these requirements.

c. 

Length of time trees have been established.

 Louisiana proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a to delete the requirement that, at the time of final bond release, at least
80 percent of the trees and shrubs shall have been in place for 60 percent of the 5-year responsibility period. Louisiana
proposed to require that (1) there shall be 450 well-distributed free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same
age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood trees per acre of the same age and (2) countable stems shall be a minimum of
3 years old.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b0(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii) require in part that, at the time of bond
release, at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall have been in place for 60 percent
of the applicable minimum period of responsibility (``80/60 requirement'').

OSM interprets proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a to require that 100 percent (i.e., all countable stems) of the trees must
be in place for a minimum of 60 percent of the responsibility period (i.e., 3 of the 5-year minimum period of responsibility).
Under this interpretation, proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a is no less effective than the ``80/60 requirement'' in the
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii). However, before OSM can make this determination,
Louisiana must clarify that this is its intent. Therefore, the Director requires that Louisiana either (1) clarify,
by policy statement, that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a requires that 100 percent (i.e., all countable stems) of the
trees must be in place for a minimum of 60 percent of the responsibility period (i.e., 3 of the 5-year minimum period
of responsibility), or (2) revise proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a to add the requirement that at least 80 percent of the
trees and shrubs used to determine success of revegetation shall have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable
minimum period of responsibility.

Following are summaries of all substantive oral and written comments on the proposed amendment that were received
by OSM, and OSM's responses to them. 



1. Public Comments 


OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received. 



2. Federal Agency Comments



Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Louisiana program (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.03). 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded on June 10, 1994, that the proposed revisions were satisfactory (administrative
record No. La&hyph;348.04). 

The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on June 14, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.05).


The U.S. Forest Service responded on June 15, 1994, that, after consulting the forest administrators in Louisiana,
it had no comments (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.06). 

The U.S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) responded on June 20, 1994, that (1) it concurred with the number of trees
required for successful revegetation of mined forest land, (2) it recommended a ground cover of at least 75 percent
to prevent unacceptable levels of soil erosion, and (3) all gullies should be repaired and revegetated prior to final
bond release (administrative record No. 348.08). 

With respect to the SCS comment concurring with the number of trees required to demonstrate revegetation success,
as discussed in finding No. 1.a, the Director is approving the standard for the tree stocking rate proposed by Louisiana
at LSMR 53123.B.4.a. 

With respect to the SCS comment concerning a recommended ground cover of 75 percent, as discussed in finding No. 1.a,
Louisiana's requirement at LSMR 53123.B.4.a for 70 percent ground cover was previously approved by OSM and is a minimum
standard. The Federal regulations of 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(iii) and 817.116(b)(3)(iii) require, for areas to be
developed for forestry, that vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required to achieve the approved
postmining land use. Louisiana, at LSMR 531117.A.4 (which is applicable to revegetation on land reclaimed for any
land use), requires that a vegetative cover be established that is capable for stabilizing the soil surface from erosion.


LSMR 53117.A.4 is substantively identical to the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.111(a)(4)
and 817.111(a)(4). In addition, Louisiana requires at LSMR 53121.A that suitable mulch and other soil stabilizing
practices shall be used on all regraded and topsoiled areas to control erosion, promote germination of seeds, or increase
the moisture content of the soil. LSMR 53121.A is no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816.114 and 817.114. Louisiana's standard for ground cover at LSMR 53123.B.4.a, in conjunction with the
requirements at LSMR 53117.A.4 and 53121.A, is consistent with and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(iii) and 817.116(b)(3)(iii). Therefore, the Director is not
requiring that Louisiana revise the standard for ground cover on areas to be developed for forestry at LSMR 53123.B.4.a
in response to this comment. 


With respect to the SCS comment that gullies should be repaired and revegetated prior to final bond release, Louisiana's
program at LSMR 53115 requires that (1) when rills and gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regarded
and topsoiled, the rills and gullies shall be filled, graded, or otherwise stabilized and the area reseeded or replanted
according to the requirements of LSMR 53117 through 53123, and (2) rills or gullies of lesser size be stabilized and
the area reseeded or replanted if the rills or gullies are disruptive to the approved postmining land use or may result
in additional erosion and sedimentation. Therefore, because Louisiana's approved program addresses the repair
and revegetation of gullies, the Director is not requiring that Louisiana revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a in response to
this comment. 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded on June 21, 1994, that it had no objection to the proposed amendment (administrative
record No. 348.07). 



3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq

.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401

Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record
No. LA&hyph;348.03). It responded on July 8, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.09).


4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)


Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM is required to solicit the written comments of SHPO and ACHP with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to historic properties.
None of the revisions that Louisiana proposed to make in its amendment pertain to historic properties. Therefore,
OSM did not request SHPO and ACHP comments.


V. Director's Decision


Based on the above findings, the Director approves with additional requirements Louisiana's proposed amendment
as submitted on May 3, 1994.
With the requirement that Louisiana further revise its rules, the Director approves, as discussed in finding Nos.
1.a through 1.c, LSMR 53123.B.4.a, concerning standards of success for revegetation on lands developed for forestry.
In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 918.16 that, within 60 days of the publication of this final rule, Louisiana must either submit a proposed
written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter
VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Louisiana's established administrative or legislative
procedures.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 918, codifying decisions concerning the Louisiana program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.


VI. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

proposed program amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and
30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Louisiana's established administrative
or legislative procedures.

(a) By November 21, 1994, Louisiana shall revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a or otherwise modify its program, to require that
trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement
shall (1) have utility for the approved postmining land use and (2) be healthy.

(b) By November 21, 1994, Louisiana shall revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a or otherwise modify its program, to either (1) clarify,
by policy statement, that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a requires that 100 percent (i.e., all countable stems) of the
trees must be in place for a minimum of 60 percent of the responsibility period, or (2) add the requirement that at least
80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine success of revegetation shall have been in place for 60 percent
of the applicable minimum period of responsibility.

Background 


On January 12, 1994 in 59 FR 1698, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SBCAPCD's Rule
331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. Rule 331 was adopted by SBCAPCD on December 10, 1991. This rule
was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on June 19, 1992. This rule was submitted in response
to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably
available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements
of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background of the above rule and nonattainment area is provided
in the NPRM cited above. 
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 1698 and in the technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX
office (TSD dated June 7, 1993).



Response to Public Comments


A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 1698. No formal comments were received. 



EPA Action 


EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions
of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Under section 307(b) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court
of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review not does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in 
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), 
and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) promulgated in the 

Federal Register

 national 
emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for 
the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry, and 
for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks 
portion of the rule. These regulations were promulgated as 
subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly 
referred to as the hazardous organic NESHAP, or the HON. 
This document contains corrections to typographical and 
cross-referencing errors in subparts F, H, and I of the 
final regulations. A few editorial corrections are also 
being made to clarify the intent of certain provisions in 
these subparts. 


Paragraph (e) of &sect;63.103 of subpart F is being revised 
to clarify that the source owner or operator is required to 
only document the basis for the determination that the 
provisions of the HON do not apply, and not to keep ongoing 
records. Tables 1 and 2 of subpart F are revised to correct 
typographical errors in spelling of several chemical names 
or the chemical abstracts services (CAS) numbers. 
Thiocarbanilide is being removed from table 1 of subpart F 
because this chemical is listed elsewhere in table 1 as 
diphenyl thiourea. 
A few editorial changes are being made to several 
sections in subpart H to clarify the intent of the 
provisions. Section 63.163(f) is being revised to remove a 
requirement to inspect sealless pumps for indications of 
liquids dripping from the pump seal. Since this inspection 
will not serve the purpose of detecting failures of these 
pumps, the requirement to perform these inspections is being 
removed. The provisions of &sect;63.180(b)(2) are being 
clarified by adding a sentence explaining that inert gases 
are not to be considered in evaluation of instrument 
response factor. 
A number of corrections are being made to subpart I to 
improve consistency in terminology and to clarify the 
provisions. This document corrects subpart I to use the 
term ``pharmaceutical production process'' in &sect;63.190(b)(5) 
and in the definitions section. The definition of 
``pharmaceutical production process'' is being clarified to 
reflect the intent of the regulatory negotiation committee. 
Editorial corrections are being made to &sect;63.190(e) and 
&sect;63.192(e) to correct a drafting error in usage of the term 
``source.'' Several errors in cross referencing subpart A of 
part 63 and other cross referencing errors are being 
corrected.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of deletion of the C&amp;J disposal site from the National Priorities List. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the C&amp;J Disposal site from the
National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is Appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New York have determined that
all appropriate Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund (Fund) -financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented
and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New York have determined
that remedial actions conducted at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 September 20, 1994.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The site to be deleted from the NPL is:

 

C&amp;J Disposal site, Eaton, New York 



The closing date for comments on the notice of intent to delete was August 20, 1994. EPA received no verbal or written
comments. 
EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and
it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Fund-financed remedial actions.
Any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions
at the site warrant such action. Section 300.66(c)(8) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be taken at
sites deleted from the NPL. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede EPA
efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
