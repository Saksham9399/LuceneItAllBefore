SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Introduction



On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal Governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
to their pre-spill condition the natural resources and the services they provide, injured by the 

Exxon Valdez

 oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resources injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.

All decisions about restoration and uses of restoration funds are made by six natural resources Trustees, three Federal
and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and of the Interior. The three State
Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game, and Environmental Conservation, and the Attorney General. A Trustee
Council, located in Alaska, composed of the three State Trustees and designees of the three Federal Trustees, is responsible
for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the restoration funds, and all restoration activities
including the preparation of a Restoration Plan.
On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473&hyph;12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Forest Service published
a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Restoration Plan. This was later revised on January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2352&hyph;2353).
The Trustee Council released a Draft Restoration Plan in November 1993, which was the proposed action for the analysis
conducted in the FEIS. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was released for public comment on June 17,
1994 (59 FR 31191) followed by a 45-day comment period ending on August 1, 1994.

Marine Mammals; Pinniped Removal Authority


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of establishment of a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force and notice of first public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the establishment of a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force (Task Force) on the sea lion/steelhead
conflict at the Ballard Locks in Seattle, WA. The Task Force is being established pursuant to section 120 of the Marine
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), as recently amended. Section 120 of the MMPA sets forth a process for consideration
of intentional lethal taking of individually identifiable pinnipeds that are having a significant negative impact
on salmonids that migrate through the Ballard Locks in Seattle. The first Task Force meeting, which is open to the public,
coincides with the date of establishment of the Task Force.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The first public meeting of the Task Force, is scheduled for September 30, 1994, at 10:00 a.m.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 The Task Force meeting will be held in the Auditorium, Building 9, at NOAA's Western Regional Center, 7600 Sand Point
Way NE. in Seattle, WA.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NMFS received an application from the State of Washington on July 12, 1994, to consider the lethal removal of California
sea lions that are depredating a wild run of winter steelhead as they migrate through the Ballard Locks. In accordance
with the process set forth in section 120 of the MMPA, NMFS determined that the State's application provided sufficient
evidence to warrant establishment of a Task Force to consider authorizing the intentional lethal taking of California
sea lions that prey on wild winter-run steelhead that migrate through the Ballard Locks in Seattle, WA. Notice of receipt
and acceptance of the State's application, along with an explanation of the process set forth in section 120 of the
MMPA, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39325) with a request for public comments. The public comment period closed on September 10,
1994, and approximately 100 public comments were received.


NMFS announces that, effective September 30, 1994, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force is established
and will have 60 days (in accordance with section 120 of the MMPA) or until November 30, 1994 to develop and submit its
recommendations to NMFS. The Task Force will have 21 members consisting of scientists who are knowledgeable about
the sea lion/steelhead conflict, representatives of conservation and fishing community organizations, the State,
Indian tribes, NOAA and other Federal agencies involved in the conflict at the Locks.
The Task Force is to review the public comments received in response to the 

Federal Register

 document and pertinent factual information on the sea lion/steelhead interaction and within 60 days:
1. Recommend to NMFS whether to approve or deny the proposed intentional lethal taking of pinnipeds, along with the
recommendation a description of the specific pinniped individuals, the proposed location, time, and method of such
taking, criteria for evaluating the success of the action, and the duration of the intentional lethal taking authority;
and
2. Suggest non-lethal alternatives, if available and practicable, including a recommended course of action.
All meetings will be open to the public, but the public will not be allowed to discuss or debate issues with the Task Force
at its meetings. However, NMFS does intend to have a pre-designated, limited amount of time at the Task Force's first
meeting to allow the public to provide new or relevant information that may assist the Task Force in its deliberations.
Subsequent meetings will be determined by the Task Force during its deliberations. Public notice of subsequent meetings
of the Task Force will be announced through NOAA Press Releases. The public may call the NOAA Public Affairs Office
in Seattle at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6046 to obtain more detailed information on the Task Force meeting dates, times
and locations.
In addition, in accordance with section 120 of the MMPA, the Task Force may need to meet again after January of 1995 to
discuss the effectiveness of its recommended actions after implementation. Specifically, the MMPA requires that
the Task Force evaluate the effectiveness of the permitted intentional lethal taking or alternative actions implemented.
If implementation is ineffective in eliminating the interaction problem, the Task Force shall recommend additional
actions. If the implementation is effective, the Task Force shall so advise NMFS and the Task Force will be disbanded.

In considering whether the State's application should be approved or denied, the Task Force is to consider:
1. Population trends, feeding habits, the location of the pinniped interaction, how and when the interaction occurs,
and how many individual pinnipeds are involved;
2. Past efforts to nonlethally deter such pinnipeds, and whether the applicant has demonstrated that no feasible
and prudent alternatives exist and that the applicant has taken all reasonable nonlethal steps without success;
3. The extent to which such pinnipeds are causing undue injury or impact to, or imbalance with, other species in the
ecosystem, including fish populations; and 
4. The extent to which such pinnipeds are exhibiting behavior that presents an ongoing threat to public safety.
NMFS expects the Task Force to strive to reach agreement on its recommendations. To enhance this process, NMFS has
procured the services of a professional facilitator to chair the meetings of the Task Force. However, if consensus
is not achieved, the Task Force should have each member vote on the controversial decisions or recommendations. The
Task Force recommendation on whether to recommend lethal taking and other determinations should be made upon a simple
majority vote; however, the minority view should be provided the opportunity to submit its recommendations in writing
to NMFS at the same time the majority view is submitted. The basis and justification for the recommendations and determinations
should be included in the Task Force's written recommendation. The Task Force should specifically address those
considerations outlined above, and any other considerations used by the Task Force in formulating its recommendations.
Other considerations may include the likelihood of success of the proposed or recommended action and relationship
to any long-term solutions to the interaction problem.
The role of the Task Force is to provide recommendations to NMFS; the final decision on whether to approve the requested
lethal removal remains with NMFS. In this regard, NMFS has asked the Task Force to fully consider and provide recommendations
on all aspects of the interaction problem, including nonlethal alternatives and steps that should be taken toward
a long-term solution. In accordance with the MMPA, upon receipt of the Task Force's recommendations, NMFS will have
30 days to decide whether to approve or deny the State's application for lethal removal. Notice of the final decision
will be published in the 

Federal Register

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) no longer believes that the Atlantic mackerel fishery will
require the imposition of some type of limited-entry management system. Therefore, August 13, 1992, is no longer
considered a control date for entry into the Atlantic mackerel fishery.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 September 27, 1994.



</DATE>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Myles Raizin, Resource Policy Analyst, 508-281-9104.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 As part of its preliminary deliberation of Amendment 5 to Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic mackerel, 

Loligo

 and 

Illex

 squid, and butterfish fisheries (FMP), the Council considered limited-entry management measures designed to address
overfishing and overcapitalization in these fisheries. A notice announcing an August 13, 1992, control date for
each of the three fisheries was published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 36384, August 13, 1992). The intent of that notice was to promote public awareness of potential eligibility
criteria for access to those fisheries and possible imposition of some form of limited-entry management regime.


Recent information regarding levels of biomass, fishing effort, and catch was presented to the Council on July 13,
1994. This information indicated that harvest levels for the squid and butterfish fisheries are approaching allowable
biological catch levels. Further, the combination of increased demand, constant production capacity, and decreasing
biomass demonstrates that the possibility of overfishing and overcapitalization in these fisheries persists.
To address this potential, the Council is still considering a limited-entry system. Thus, a control date continues
to be necessary to discourage additional entry. The Council and NMFS believe that the previously announced August
13, 1992, control date is appropriate for the squid and butterfish fisheries.
The data also indicated that Atlantic mackerel catch and fishing effort decreased in 1993 and 1994 while stock size
remained fairly constant. Further, stock biomass estimates are extremely high. Due to these facts, the Council believes
that the Atlantic mackerel fishery will not require a limited-entry management system in the near future. Therefore,
NMFS announces the recision of the August 13, 1992, control date with respect to this fishery.

The proposed action is to dredge and make structural upgrades at Pier D of the PSNS, and dispose of the dredged material
in federally and state approved disposal sites. The action will provide the necessary bathymetry for permanent berthing
for up to two AOE&hyph;6 Class ships and temporary berthing of one of the largest deep draft ships already homeported
at PSNS, typically an aircraft carrier. The proposed action has been developed from a combination of three berthing
configurations and five disposal options. The required dredging quantity is approximately 105,000 cubic yards,
of which approximately 53,400 cubic yards are contaminated and are unsuitable for in-water disposal. The disposal
method is a mixed mode of operation which utilizes an upland facility (landfill) for contaminated sediment disposal
and an in-water site for disposing of clean material. The primary upland disposal site is the Olympic View Sanitary
Landfill (OVSL) about 10 miles south of Bremerton. The Roosevelt Regional Landfill (RRL) and Columbia Ridge Landfill
and Recycling Center (CRLRC) would be used as backup in the event of unforeseen problems at OVSL. Each of these landfills
is currently authorized to accept the type of dredged materials produced by this project which have been designated
unsuitable for in-water disposal by regulatory agencies. The primary in-water disposal site is the Puget Sound Dredge
Disposal Analysis (PSDDA) approved Elliot Bay disposal site near Seattle which is about 15 miles east of PSNS; backup
sites include PSDDA approved Commencement Bay near Tacoma or Port Gardner near Everett.


Other berthing configurations and the ``No Action'' alternative were considered and eliminated. Other berthing
configurations would not address the Navy's need for operational flexibility at PSNS with respect to large deep-draft
vessels. The ``No Action'' alternative would not accommodate Navy's AOE&hyph;6 homeporting mission in the west
coast.

Disposal options considered and eliminated were capped aquatic disposal (CAD), an upland disposal facility (CDF),
near-shore confined disposal (NCDF), and a combination of PSDDA and NCDF.
Although an alternative requiring less dredging or ``no action'' would have fewer environmental impacts (but would
not fulfill the purpose and need for the project), the dredging and dredged material disposal methods chosen will
have the least practicable impacts and are environmentally preferred.
Transfer of the dredged material designated for upland disposal from marine to upland transportation will occur
at a shoreside transfer area located near the west side of PSNS. The shoreside transfer area will be paved with an impervious
pavement and curbing to prevent penetration of liquids into subsurface soils, or uncontrolled release into Sinclair
Inlet. Within this area, dredged materials will be segregated according to moisture content, and loaded onto trucks
for transport to the landfill. Runoff will be directed to sumps that will be used to convey water to settling tanks before
discharging into Sinclair Inlet. If the moisture content of the dredged materials is too high for disposal at the landfill
site, soil stabilization/solidification treatment measures will be employed to mitigate the problems. Materials
that are acceptable to the landfill will not be treated prior to disposal.
Treatment will be through the addition of a portland cement/pozzolan mixture and/or additional drying. In a portland
cement/pozzolan reaction, portland cement is combined with flyash or other pozzolan to produce a sediment-concrete
mixture. Water is entrained in the hydration of the portland cement. The moist material will be screened and mechanically
fed to a pugmill-type mixing plant. Portland cement/pozzolan soil additives are added through pneumatic system
to the pugmill mixer. The treated material will be delivered to the landfill storage site thoroughly mixed and relatively
uniform in appearance with all ingredients evenly distributed.
The preferred site for upland disposal is the OVSL in Kitsap County. The RRL and CRLRC are designated as alternative
sites to provide flexibility and ensure project completion. Although OVSL has enough capacity for the volume determined
to be unsuitable for open-water disposal, unforeseen circumstances related to dredging, transportation, or landfill
operations could adversely affect the overall project schedule. Rather than delay the project, the alternative
disposal sites would be used until use of the OVSL is reestablished. Use of these sites would involve the same process
as described above for dewatering and treatment, but transportation would occur by rail car rather than by truck.
Dredging causes localized short-term effects on water quality in the immediate vicinity of the dredge operation.
This will be mitigated through the use of regulatory dilution zones and water quality monitoring during the dredging
operation. If water quality effects exceed these of regulatory requirements, such as alterations in pH value, dissolved
oxygen, and/or turbidity to an unacceptable quantity, the dredging operation will be halted until the cause of the
water quality degradation is identified and mitigated. Dredging is allowed to proceed only after all practicable
measures are taken to correct the problem. The FSEIS and water quality permits provide water quality mitigation requirements.
These requirements are a part of the construction specification detailing approaches and equipment requirements
to maintain environmental quality.
Temporary losses will occur in benthic infauna, epifauna, and other bottom dwelling organisms through destruction
of existing benthic habitat in the area affected by dredging. However, these losses are anticipated to be recovered
within about a year after completion of the work.
Dredging operation, tug-barge transportation, and truck/train hauling operation will produce short term localized
increases in air emissions and noise. No safety related effects are anticipated from these impacts. The affected
area is in attainment with clean air standards and an air conformity analysis is not required.
The SEIS was prepared by the Navy in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region X; U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Seattle District; Washington State Department of Ecology; City of Bremerton; and the Suquamish
Tribe. The FSEIS was distributed to agencies and officials of federal, state and local governments, citizen groups
and associates, public libraries, and other interested parties for review. The comment period ended on September
6, 1994. All significant issues identified were resolved through discussions with concerned agencies and parties.
Questions regarding the Draft and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement prepared for this action may
be directed to: Commanding Officer, Engineering Field Activity Northwest, Naval Facilities Engineering Command,
3505 Anderson Hill Road, Silverdale, WA, 98383&hyph;9130 (Attn: Mr. Peter Havens, Code 232.PH), telephone (206)

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed grant will provide funding to Howard University, which is a nationally recognized historically black
academic institution with a broad curriculum. The Howard University School of Continuing Education (HUSCE) is one
of the 17 schools and colleges of Howard University. HUSCE was established in April 1986 to meet the special higher-education
needs of a rapidly expanding community of professionals, administrators, entrepreneurs, technical personnel,
paraprofessionals and other adults. A part of the mission of the HUSCE is to serve as the central administrative unit
for coordinating all continuing education at the University and for administering the Summer Sessions.



The program is meritorious because it not only provides the interface desired in the above subject areas, but also
supports the Department's objective of building a well-educated and diverse community in energy-related fields
of study reflecting the core values articulated in the Department of Energy Strategic Plan. This project will promote
education as well as provide local colleges and universities the opportunity to provide a curriculum to the community
which will better prepare them to gain employment with the Department of Energy.

Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the application
represents a beneficial method for the Department to form partnerships with the academic community to foster educational
growth closely attuned to national energy policy and technology development. The result should be university graduates
which represent a diverse population with the foundation required to more adequately address the national energy
challenges.

at Penn Power's substation located in the Borough or, alteratively, at 138 kV at Penn Power's Hoytdale Substation.


The proposed date for initiating the requested transmission service is September 1, 1994, or as soon thereafter as
possible. The proposed date for terminating the requested transmission services is September 1, 1999, or five years
after initiating service. 



Comment date: 

October 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that each State identify those waters for which existing required
pollution controls are not stringent enough to implement State water quality standards. For those waters, states
are required to establish total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) according to priority ranking. The identified waters
and loads are required to be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval from ``time to time.''




On January 11, 1985 EPA published a final rule (50 FR 1775) that established 40 CFR part 130 (Water Quality Planning
and Management). This rule established certain requirements for State and local government water quality programs,
including requirements related to the implementation of section 303(d) of the CWA. The regulation did not specify
dates for State compliance with the section 303(d) requirements, but reiterated the statutory provision calling
for submission from time to time. On July 24, 1992, EPA published a final rule (57 FR 33040) that amended 40 CFR 130.7.
The rule established that each state shall submit biennially to the Regional Administrator beginning in 1992 the
list of waters, pollutants causing impairment, and the priority ranking including waters targeted for TMDL development
within the next two years. Consistent with EPA's amended regulation Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri have submitted
to EPA for approval their list decisions under section 303(d)(2). EPA today proposes to approve these lists submitted
by Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri and solicits public comment on the proposed approval decisions and on the state lists.

<DOCTITLE>L.B.L. Enterprises, Inc. v. Con-Freight Marine Line, Inc.; Notice of Filing of Complaint and Assignment</DOCTITLE>



Notice is given that a complaint filed by L.B.L. Enterprises, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Con-Freight Marine
Line, Inc. (``Respondent'') was served September 21, 1994. Complainant alleges that Respondent is a non vessel operating
common carrier that violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;1709(d)(1). Complainant
states that Respondent prepared a bill of lading incorrectly showing the Port of Discharge to be St. Petersburg, Russia
on two shipments to Riga, Latvia, corrected the port of discharge while the two shipments were in transit without correcting
the delivery contact agent which Complainant later found handled shipments only to Russia, refused to reimburse
Complainant for costs of a Latvian driver to transport the shipments from St. Petersburg to Riga after promising to
do so, and caused both shipments to arrive late. Further, Complainant alleges respondent refused to return a security
deposit that was required for release of the second shipment in St. Petersburg, after promising to do so.

This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,
shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given
by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by September 21, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission
shall be issued by January 19, 1996.

action: 

Request for public comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') is conducting a study mandated by Section 13 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act Amendments of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;312, which requires that the Commission review ``its statutory
responsibilities to identify those matters within its jurisdiction where Federal enforcement is particularly
necessary or desirable and those areas that might more effectively be enforced at the State or local level.'' The Commission
requests public comment concerning these issues.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
dates: 

Written comments will be accepted until October 27, 1994.

addresses: 

Comments should be directed to: Secretary, Federal Trade Commission, Room H&hyph;159, Sixth and Pennsylvania Ave.,

Commission, Washington, DC 20580.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The Federal Trade Commission Act Amendments of 1994 became law on August 26, 1994. Public Law 103&hyph;312, 108 Stat.
1691. Section 13 directs the Commission, within six months of the bill's enactment, to transmit to the Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives
a report on Federal-State Cooperation. The report is ``to identify those matters within [The Commission's] jurisdiction
where Federal enforcement is particularly necessary or desirable and those areas that might more effectively be
enforced at the State or local level.'' In conducting this review, the Commission is directed to ``consider the resources
available to the Commission and the States, as well as particular rules that have been promulgated by the Commission.''
In addition, the Commission must ``consider such other issues as will result in more efficient implementation of
the statutory responsibilities of the Commission.''



Section 13 directs the Commission to ``consult with the attorneys general of the States, representatives of consumers
and industry, and other interested parties.'' The Commission is issuing this Notice to solicit written comments
from interested members of the public on the issues described above. Because the report must be transmitted to Congress
by February 27, 1995, the comment period is limited to 30 days.

Commission staff expects to hold informal meetings with persons and groups interested in the topics to be addressed
in the report. All interested parties are nonetheless urged to file written comments, because the staff may not be
able to accommodate all of the interested groups that wish to meet.

Comments should focus on areas of the Commission's enforcement authority that might be implemented more effectively
and efficiently by altering the present manner in which enforcement activity is shared between the Commission and
State or local agencies. Specific areas of interest include enforcement allocations respecting trade regulation
rules, deceptive marketing practices, deceptive advertising, consumer credit and debt collection practices,
and anticompetitive conduct that primarily affects consumers within a particular State or local area versus conduct
that has primarily regional or national impact. In any assessment of enforcement allocations in these areas, the
impact on resources available to the Commission and the States to carry out their other law enforcement responsibilities
should be considered. Comments should discuss the basis for any recommendations, and describe any statutory changes
or changes in the Commission's rules that might be necessary to implement the recommendations. Comments directed
to telemarketing practices should recognize that the statutory authority of both the Commission and the States has
recently been affected by the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, Public Law 103&hyph;297,
108 Stat. 1545 (Aug. 16, 1994). 

The Commission anticipates that both the range and the analysis of enforcement reallocation opportunities may differ
with respect to the Commission's consumer protection and competition missions. Therefore, comments dealing specifically
with the Commission's consumer protection responsibilities should be segregated from comments dealing with the
Commission's maintaining competition responsibilities. Documents containing the former should be titled ``Consumer
Protection Comment;'' those containing the latter should be titled ``Maintaining Competition Comment.''




By Direction of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules</DOCTITLE>


Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 

Federal Register

.
The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed
acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

1. The term ``product'' means any product that is offered for sale, sold or distributed to the public by respondent,
its successors and assigns, under the ``Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter'' band name or any other brand name of respondent,
its successors and assigns; and also means any product sold or distributed to the public by third parties under private
labeling agreements with respondent, its successors and assigns.

2. The term ``competent and reliable scientific evidence'' means tests, analyses, research, studies or other evidence
based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant areas, that has been conducted and evaluated in an objective
manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and
reliable results.



I





It is ordered

 that respondent, Chemopharm Laboratory Inc., a corporation, its successors and assigns, and its officers, agents,
representatives, and employees, directly or through any corporation, subsidiary, division, or other device, in
connection with the manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or distribution
of any product in or affecting commerce, as ``commerce'' is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, do forthwith
cease and desist from representing, in any manner, directly or by implication, that:

A. Such product is ``environmentally safe,'' ``protects the total environment,'' or otherwise offers any environmental
benefit; or

B. Such product provides the environmental benefits of Calcium Magnesium Acetate,




unless such representation is true and, at the time of making such representation, respondent possesses and relies
upon competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence,
that substantiates such representation.



II





It is further ordered

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement containing a consent order from
Chemopharm Laboratory, Inc., 


d/b/a CP Industries, an Utah corporation (``CP Industries'' or ``respondent''). Upon this agreement, the respondent
will cease and desist from claiming that any product is environmentally safe, protects the total environment, otherwise
offers any environmental benefit, or provides the environmental benefits of Calcium Magnesium Acetate (``CMA''),
unless such representation is true and, at the time of making such representation, it possesses adequate substantiation.
The proposed consent agreement also prohibits CP Industries from misrepresenting the results of any test or study.


The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixy (60) days for receipt of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
This matter concerns claims made for CP Industries' Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter product. The complaint accompanying
the proposed consent order alleges, in part, that the respondent engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation
of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. According to the complaint, the respondent represented that Superior
Sno-N-Ice Melter does not harm or damage the environment; that Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter provides the environmental
benefits of CMA; that scientific studies of CMA demonstrate that Superior Sno-N-Ice is beneficial to the environment;
and that it had a reasonable basis for these claims. In fact, Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter contains about 95% sodium chloride
(i.e., rock salt) which does harm or damage the environment. Therefore, Superior Sno-N-Ice does harm or damage the
environment; Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter does not provide the environmental benefits of CMA; and scientific studies
of CMA do not demonstrate that Superior Sno-N-Ice Melter is beneficial to the environment. The complaint therefore
alleges that the claims are false and misleading and also alleges that CP Industries lacked a reasonable basis for
making the claims.
The consent order contains provisions designed to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar allegedly illegal
acts and practices in the future.
Paragraph I of the proposed consent order requires CP Industries to cease representing that any product is ``environmentally
safe,'' ``protects the total environment,'' or otherwise offers any environmental benefit; or that any product
provides the environmental benefits of CMA, unless such representation is true and substantiated. Paragraph II
of the order prohibits CP Industries from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity, results, conclusions,
or interpretations of any test or study.
The remaining parts of the proposed consent order require the respondent to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate
claims covered by the order, to distribute copies of the order to each of its operating divisions and to certain company
officials, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order,
and to file one or more compliance reports.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed consent order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Cooperative Agreement With the Iowa Department of Public Health for Health Assessment of Persian Gulf War Veterans




Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year (FY)
1995 funds for a cooperative agreement with the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) for Health Assessments of
Persian Gulf War Veterans. Approximately $1.50 million is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund this project.
It is expected that the award will begin on or about December 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within
a project period of up to 2 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within
the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement will be to conduct a pilot survey which will assess the past and present health
status of Iowa residents who are Persian Gulf War veterans compared with other Iowa residents who are Persian Gulf
War-era veterans, in terms of self-reported health outcomes. This assessment will serve as a model for potential
future similar assessments undertaken by other Federal agencies, States, local governments, or universities.
CDC will serve as the principal point of contact with the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to secure
names and locating information for the study participants; provide expert review, comment and approval on all study
protocols, data collection instruments, analysis plans, media releases, draft and final reports, and publications
generated by the recipient and its contractors and ensures appropriate involvement of related Federal agencies
and veteran services organizations. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.
This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000,
see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

.) 



Authority 



This program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act, section 301 (42 U.S.C. 241). 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Assistance will be provided only to IDPH for conducting this project. No other applications are solicited. The Program
Announcement and application kit have been sent to IDPH. 

IDPH is the most appropriate organization to conduct the work under this cooperative agreement for the following
reasons: 

1. IDPH among the States has taken aggressive and positive steps to address the health concerns among Iowa Gulf War
veterans. It has already established vital links among Iowa veterans' groups and scientists to address these concerns
and are therefore in the strongest position to carry out this effort rapidly and cost effectively. 

2. IDPH has the statutory responsibility for protecting and enhancing the public health of the citizens of the State
of Iowa. This includes assessing the impact of the Persian Gulf War experience on the health of Iowa residents who are
Gulf War or Gulf War-era veterans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Introduction 


Demonstration Proposals Pursuant to Section 1115 of the Social 
Security Act_General Policies and Procedures 



Under Section 1115, the Department of Health and Human 
Services is given latitude, subject to the requirements of the 
Social Security Act, to consider and approve research and 
demonstration proposals with a broad range of policy objectives. 
The Department desires to facilitate the testing of new policy 
approaches to social problems. Such demonstrations can provide 
valuable knowledge that will help lead to improvements in 
achieving the purposes of the Act. The Department also is 
committed to both a thorough and an expeditious review of State 
requests to conduct such demonstrations. 

In exercising her discretionary authority, the Secretary has 
developed a number of policies and procedures for reviewing 
proposals. In order to ensure a sound, expeditious and open 
decision-making process, the Department will be guided by the 
policies and procedures described in this statement in accepting 
and reviewing proposals submitted pursuant to section 1115.

II. General Considerations 



To facilitate the testing of new policy approaches to social 
problems the Department will_ 

&bull;Work with States to develop research and demonstrations 
in areas consistent with the Department's policy goals; 
&bull;Consider proposals that test alternatives that diverge 
from that policy direction; and 
&bull;Consider, as a criterion for approval, a State's 
ability to implement the research or demonstration project. 
While the Department expects to review and accept a range of 
proposals, it may disapprove or limit proposals on policy grounds 
or because the proposal creates potential constitutional problems 
or violations of civil rights laws or equal protection 
requirements. The Department seeks proposals which preserve and 
enhance beneficiary access to quality services. Within this 
overall policy framework, the Department is prepared to_

&bull;Grant waivers to test the same or related policy 
innovations in multiple States, (replication is a valid mechanism 
by which the effectiveness of policy changes can be assessed); 
&bull;Approve demonstration projects ranging in scale from 
reasonably small to state-wide or multi-state, and 
&bull;Consider joint Medicare-Medicaid demonstrations, such 
as those granted in the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the 
Elderly (PACE) and Social Health Maintenance Organization (SHMO) 
demonstrations, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
(AFDC)-Medicaid waivers. 


III. Duration 



The complex range of policy issues, design methodologies, 
and unanticipated events inherent in any research or 
demonstration makes it very difficult to establish a single 
Department policy on the duration of 1115 waivers. However, the 
Department is committed, through negotiations with State 
applicants, to_

&bull;Approve waivers of at least sufficient duration to give 
new policy approaches a fair test. The duration of 
waiver approval should be congruent with the magnitude 
and complexity of the project (for example, large-scale 
statewide reform programs will typically require 
waivers of five years); 
&bull;Provide reasonable time for the preparation of 
meaningful evaluation results prior to the conclusion 
of the demonstration; and 
&bull;Recognize that new approaches often involve 
considerable start-up time and allowance for 
implementation delays. 

The Department is also committed, when successful 
demonstrations provide an appropriate basis, to working with 
State governments to seek permanent statutory changes 
incorporating those results. In such cases, consideration will 
be given to a reasonable extension of existing waivers.

IV. Evaluation 


As with the duration of waivers, the complex range of policy 
issues, design methodologies, and unanticipated events also makes 
it very difficult to establish a single Department policy on 
evaluation. This Department is committed to a policy of 
meaningful evaluations using a broad range of appropriate 
evaluation strategies (including true experimental, quasi- 
experimental, and qualitative designs) and will be flexible and 
project-specific in the application of evaluation techniques. 
This policy will be most evident with health care waivers. 
Within-site randomized design is the preferred approach for most 
AFDC waivers. The Department will consider alternative 
evaluation designs when such designs are methodologically 
comparable. The Department is also eager to ensure that the 
evaluation process be as unintrusive as possible to the 
beneficiaries in terms of implementing and operating the policy 
approach to be demonstrated, while ensuring that critical lessons 
are learned from the demonstration. 


V. Cost Neutrality 


The Department's fiduciary obligations in a period of 
extreme budgetary stringency require maintenance of the principle 
of cost neutrality, but the Department believes it should be 
possible to apply that principle flexibly. 
&bull;The Department will assess cost neutrality over the 
life of a demonstration project, not on a year-by-year 
basis, since many demonstrations involve making ``up-front'' investments in order to achieve out-year 
savings. 
&bull;The Department recognizes the difficulty of making 
appropriate baseline projections of Medicaid 
expenditures, and is open to development of a new 
methodology in that regard. 
&bull;In assessing budget neutrality, the Department will not 
rule out consideration of other cost neutral 
arrangements proposed by States. 
&bull;States may be required to conform, within a reasonable 
period of time, relevant aspects of their 
demonstrations to the terms of national health care 
reform legislation, including global budgeting 
requirements, and to the terms of national welfare 
reform legislation. 


VI. Timeliness and Administrative Complexity 


The Department is committed to minimizing the administrative 
burden on the States and to reducing the processing time for 
waiver requests. In order to accomplish this the Department has 
adopted a number of procedures, including_
&bull;Expanding pre-application consultation with States; 
&bull;Setting, and sharing with applicants, a well-defined 
schedule for each application, with established target 
dates for processing and reaching a decision on the 
application; 
&bull;Maintaining, to the extent feasible, a policy of one 
consolidated request for further information; 
&bull;Sharing proposed terms and conditions with applicants 
before making final decisions; 
&bull;Establishing concurrent, rather than sequential, review 
of waivers by all relevant units of the Department and 
with other relevant Departments and the Office of Management and Budget; 
&bull;Expanding technical assistance activities to the 
States; and 
&bull;Developing multi-state waiver solicitations in areas of 
priority concern, including integrated long-term care 
system development, services for adolescents, and 
services in rural areas. 
The Department will continue to follow and develop 
procedures, and commit internal resources to reviewing 
demonstration proposals, necessary for a sound and expeditious 
review process. 


VII. State Notice Procedures 


The Department recognizes that people who may be affected by 
a demonstration project have a legitimate interest in learning 
about proposed projects and having input into the decision-making 
process prior to the time a proposal is submitted to the 
Department. A process that facilitates public involvement and 
input promotes sound decision-making.

There are many ways that States can provide for such input. 
In order to allow for public input into the proposals, the 
Department expects States to ordinarily follow one (or more if 
the State desires) of the processes described in this section. 

1. At any time prior to submitting a section 1115 
demonstration proposal to the Department of Health and Human 
Services, a State may provide to the Department a written 
description of the process the State will use for receipt of 
public input into the proposal prior to its submission to the 
Department. 

Within 15 days of receipt of such description, the 
Department will notify the State whether the described process 
provides adequate opportunity for public input. The Department 
will accept any process that_

&bull;Includes the holding of one or more public hearings, at 
which the most recent working proposal is described and made 
available to the public, and time is provided during which 
comments can be received; or 

&bull;Uses a commission or other similar process, where 
meetings are open to members of the public, in the development of 
the proposal; or 

&bull;Results from enactment of a proposal by the State 
legislature prior to submission of the demonstration proposal, 
where the outline of such proposal is contained in the 
legislative enactment; or 

&bull;Provides for formal notice and comment in accordance with 
the State's administrative procedure act; provided that such 
notice must be given at least 30 days prior to submission; or 

&bull;Includes notice of the intent to submit a demonstration 
proposal in newspapers of general circulation, and provides a 
mechanism for receiving a copy of the working proposal and an 
opportunity, which shall not be less than 30 days, to comment on 
the proposal; or, 

&bull;Includes any other similar process for public input that 
would afford an interested party the opportunity to learn about 
the contents of the proposal, and to comment on its contents. 

The State shall include in the demonstration proposal it 
submits to the Department a statement (a narrative of several 
sentences) briefly describing the process that it followed in 
implementing the process previously presented to the Department. 
The Department may find a proposal incomplete if the process has 
not been followed. 

2. A State that has not followed the procedures described 
in paragraph 1. must submit a description of the process that was used in 
the State to obtain public input, at the time it submits its 
demonstration proposal. The Department will notify the State if 
the process was adequate within 15 days after the application is 
submitted, applying the same criteria as in paragraph 1. If the process 
was not adequate, the State can cure the inadequacy by_

Posting a notice in the newspaper of widest circulation in 
each city with a population of 100,000 or more, or in the 
newspaper of widest circulation in the State if there is no city 
with a population of 100,000, indicating that a demonstration 
proposal has been submitted. Such notice shall describe the 
major elements of the proposed demonstration and any changes in 
benefits, payments, eligibility, responsibilities, or provider 
selection requested in the proposal. The notice shall indicate 
how interested persons can obtain copies of the proposal and 
shall specify that written comments will be accepted by the State 
for a period of thirty days. If a State follows such a 
procedure, the State should respond to requests for copies of the 
proposal within seven days. The State should maintain a record 
of all comments received through this process. 

All HHS commitments with respect to times for responding to 
demonstration proposals shall be tolled until this process is 
completed. 



VIII. Federal Notice 



The Department of Health and Human Services intends to 
publish a monthly notice in the 

Federal Register

 of all new and 
pending proposals submitted pursuant to section 1115. The notice 
will indicate that the Department accepts written comments 
regarding all demonstration project proposals. 

The Department will maintain a list of organizations that 
have requested notice that a demonstration proposal has been 
received and will notify such organizations when a proposal is 
received.

IX. Comments 



The Department will not approve or disapprove a proposal for 
at least 30 days after the proposal has been received, in order 
to receive and consider comments. The Department will attempt, 
if feasible, to acknowledge receipt of all comments, but the 
Department will not provide written responses to comments. 


X. Findings 



The Department will prepare a decision memorandum at the 
time a demonstration proposal is granted or denied, discussing 
why the Department granted or denied the proposal and how an 
approved demonstration meets the criteria established by statute. 


XI. Administrative Record 



The Department will maintain an administrative record which 
will generally consist of: the formal demonstration application 
from the State; issue papers sent to the State and State 
responses; public and Congressional comments sent to the 
Department and any Department responses; the Department's 
decision memorandum regarding the granting or denial of a 
proposal; and the final terms and conditions, and waivers, sent 
to the State and the State acceptance of them. 


XII. Sub-state Demonstrations 



When a demonstration is to be implemented in only part of a 
State, the State will be required to provide information on the 
likely demographic composition of populations subject to and not 
subject to the demonstration in the State. When relevant, the 
Department will require that the evaluation component of a 
project address the impact of the project on particular subgroups 
of the population. 


XIII. Implementation Reviews 



As part of the terms and conditions of any demonstration 
proposal that is granted, the Department may require periodic 
evaluations of how the project is being implemented. The 
Department will review, and when appropriate investigate, 
documented complaints that a State is failing to comply with 
requirements specified in the terms and conditions and 
implementing waivers of any approved demonstration. 


XIV. Legal Effect 



This notice is intended to inform the public and the States 
regarding procedures the Department ordinarily will follow in 
exercising the Secretary's discretionary authority with respect 
to State demonstration proposals under section 1115. This notice 
does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or equity, by any person or entity, against 
the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, the States, 
or any other person.

ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the American
chaffseed (

Schwalbea americana

). The American chaffseed, which historically occurred in all the coastal states from Massachusetts to Louisiana
as well as the inland states of Kentucky and Tennessee, is now limited to New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida. The species was listed as endangered in 1992 due to its extirpation from over half of its historical
range and a decline in known occurrences. Although the number of known populations has increased substantially since
the time of its listing, threats to the survival of the American chaffseed remain, primarily due to fire suppression
and concomitant vegetational succession of the fire-maintained ecosystems where the species occurs. The recovery
objective for this species is to be able to reclassify it to threatened status by protecting at least 50 distinct, self-sustaining
American chaffseed populations. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft Plan.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments on the draft Recovery Plan must be received December 27, 1994, to receive consideration by the Service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background


Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.
The document submitted for review is the draft American Chaffseed (

Schwalbea americana

) Recovery Plan. This perennial member of the figwort family, a montypic genus, is primarily a coastal plain species
of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The few inland exceptions to its coastal distribution are historic records. Although
the number of known extant occurrences of the American chaffseed has increased three-fold since the species' listing
in 1992 (due mainly to intensive searches in South Carolina), its range has undergone a significant contraction since
the species was first recognized in 1935: where it used to be found in 13 states from Massachusetts in the North to Texas
in the South, it now occurs in 5 states, from New Jersey to Florida.

Its decline is attributed primarily to development and succession of its habitat, and these threats to the species'
survival persist. Sandy pineland communities where the species exists have proven to be especially vulnerable to
development because soils are level, deep, and suitable for building sites. Remaining American chaffseed sites
are threatened primarily by activities or management practices that result in restriction or suppression of fire,
which is apparently needed to maintain the open subclimax ecosystem inhabited by the species. Other continuing threats
to American chaffseed include inadvertent disturbance to plants, discontinuation of game management and the consequent
cessation of burning, conversion of the fire-maintained flatwoods and savannas to commercial pine plantations,
commercial pine straw raking, and the increasing restrictions on prescribed burning of forest tracts.
Reclassification of the American chaffseed is the primary objective of the draft Recovery Plan. Reclassification
to threatened status will be considered when at least 50 geographically distinct American chaffseed populations
are permanently protected and managed as needed to ensure long-range viability, and the species is established or
found at four additional sites in the northern portion of its range. A delisting objective is not being defined at this
time.
Recovery of the American chaffseed will be achieved through a combination of habitat protection and management,
reintroduction of the species in portions of its former range, research aimed at better understanding the species'
biology in order to predict viability of populations, and research to determine the best techniques to maintain the
species and its habitat.
The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the Plan.

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) endangered species program. To
help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native
to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish
criteria for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery

The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies also will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The Maguire daisy is a perennial, herbaceous plant in the composite family (Asteraceae). The plant's stems are up
to 18 cm (7 inches) tall. One to three flower heads are borne at the end of each stem. Each floral head has 15 to 20 pinkish
white ray flowers and orange disk flowers. The species range is in the San Rafael Swell in Emery County and in Capitol
Reef in Wayne County, Utah. Currently 25 locations representing 5 separate populations are known with a total population
of approximately 3,000 individuals.


The Maguire daisy (

Erigeron maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

) was listed as an endangered species under the authority of the Act, as amended, on September 5, 1985 (50 FR 36089).
The species (

Erigeron maguirei

) was proposed for reclassification as threatened on September 7, 1994 (59 FR 46219). This species was listed due to
its small population size and to current and potential threats from grazing and surface disturbing activities of
the species habitat. The goal of the recovery plan is to maintain viable populations to ensure the species survival
and to guide recovery efforts to facilitate delisting the species. Recovery efforts will focus on protecting the
species population and habitat from habitat destroying activities through the section 6, 7, and 9 prohibitions of
the Act for plant species. Biological and ecological research of the species' biology and its relationship and interaction
with its environment is necessary to guide future management of the species population and habitat to ensure its continued
survival and the preservation of the species ecosystem. Additional recovery efforts will focus on inventory of potential
habitat and minimum viable population studies of its known populations.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described above. All comments received by the date specified

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the General Management Plan for Mount Rainier National
Park, Washington.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The National Park Service will prepare a General Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/EIS) for
Mount Rainier National Park, Washington. The GMP/EIS will describe and analyze a proposal and alternatives for the
future management of the park for approximately 15 years past approval of the plan.



A Master Plan was completed for Mount Rainier National Park in 1974; however, this plan is outdated and does not address
current issues. In recent years, visitor use in the park has increased substantially, resulting in traffic circulation
and parking problems, as well as degradation of vegetation and erosion of soil from off-trail use. External encroachments
and adverse impacts along the park boundaries are also increasing. Current projects and plans that are addressing
some immediate needs of the park include a gateway community assistance initiative, a transportation study and a
Natural Resource Management Plan. The results of these projects will provide vital information for the GMP.

Issues to be addressed in the GMP/EIS include, but are not limited to: Traffic and circulation patterns, impacts of
land uses outside the park, geological and hydrologic hazards and natural resources and visitor use management.
Visitor density and distribution in the park and methods to mitigate impact on park resources while ensuring a quality
visitor experience will also be considered. Alternatives to address these issues will be developed in cooperation
with the public and will include a no-action alternative. Additionally, the EIS will provide a comprehensive analysis
of impacts, taking into account cumulative effects.

Representatives of federal, state and local agencies, private organizations and individuals from the general public
who may be interested in or affected by the proposed GMP/EIS are invited to participate in the scoping process by responding
to this Notice with written comments. The scoping process will help define issues, concerns, and potential impacts
related to the plan. Public scoping meetings are expected to be held in November 1994. The time and location of these
meetings will be announced prior to that time through the local media and the park's mailing list.

The draft GMP/EIS is expected to be available for public review in 1997 and the final GMP/EIS and Record of Decision
completed one year later.

The responsible official is Charles H. Odegaard, Regional Director, Pacific Northwest Region, National Park Service.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
dates: 

Written comments about the scope of issues and impact topics to be analyzed in the GMP/EIS should be received no later
than 60 days from the date of publication of this Notice.

KCS was authorized to acquire The Fort Smith and Van Buren Railway Company (FSVB) in 1939 in Finance Docket No. 12475.
FSVB no longer exists as a separate legal entity; it was merged into KCS on July 6, 1992. 
</FOOTNOTE>


KCS has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the lines for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic has been
rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the lines (or a State or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the lines either is pending with the Commission
or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the
requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (service of environmental report on agencies), 49 CFR 1105.8 (service of historic report
on State Historic Preservation Officer), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (service
of verified notice on governmental agencies) have been met.

 This notice has been delayed to allow KCS to comply with the filing requirements of 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1), to clarify
the status of FSVB, and to confirm that the proposed transaction is abandonment and not merely service discontinuance.

</FOOTNOTE>


As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen

, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for
partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on October 27, 1994 (unless stayed pending reconsideration). Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

3

 formal expressions of intent to file OFAs under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by October 17, 1994.

A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environ-mental
issues (whether raised by a party or by the Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot
be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. 

See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines

A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Jay M. Nadlman, 114
West Eleventh St., Kansas City, MO 64105&hyph;1804. 
If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, use of the exemption is void 

ab initio

. 
The Rails to Trails Conservancy (RTC) supports the abandonment and seeks issuance of a notice of interim trail use/rail
banking (NITU) under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) covering the involved lines. RTC has submitted a statement of willingness
to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and
is willing to negotiate with RTC. 
While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption
is published in the 

Federal Register

 [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for
imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS's willingness to enter into negotiations
with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below.
If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement
is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines. 

See

 49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1). 
Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does
it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional
trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the right-of-way for trail purposes is subject
to restoration for railroad purposes. 
The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the OFA
process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in 

Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails

, 2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) (

Trails

), OFA's to acquire rail lines for continued rail service or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim
trail use conditions.

6

 Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective
date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective
date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process. 

See

 49 CFR 1152.27 (e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption
will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail
use may proceed. 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
 The statement in 

Trails

 that section 10905 does not apply to abandonment or discontinuance exemptions has since been superseded by the adoption
of rules allowing OFAs in these exemption proceedings. 

See

 49 CFR 1152.27. 
</FOOTNOTE>


KCS has filed an environmental report addressing the effects of the abandonment, if any, on the environment and historic
resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) issued an environmental assessment (EA) on September 9,
1994, and comments were due on September 21, 1994. The EA recommended that an historic condition be imposed found that
the right-of-way may be suitable for other public use. Because we are now issuing this notice, we will give interested
persons an additional 15 days, to October 12, 1994, to file comments to the EA. Interested persons may obtain a copy
of the EA from SEA by writing to it (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling
Elaine Kaiser, Chief, SEA at (202) 927&hyph;6248. 
Environmental, historic preservation, or public use conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent
decision. 


It is ordered:

 
1. Subject to the conditions set forth above, KCS may discontinue service, cancel tariffs for the lines on not less
than 10 days' notice to the Commission, and salvage track and material consistent with interim trail use/rail banking
after the effective date of this notice of exemption and NITU. Tariff cancellations must refer to this notice by date
and docket number. 
2. If an interim trail use/rail banking agreement is reached, then with respect to the right-of-way it must require
the trail user to assume, for the term of the agreement, full responsibility for management, for any legal liability
arising out of transfer or use (unless the user is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the railroad
for any potential liability), and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed. 
3. Interim trail use/rail banking is subject to the future restoration of rail service and to the user's continuing
to meet the financial obligations for the right of-way. 
4. If interim trail use is implemented and subsequently the user intends to terminate trail use, it must send the Commission
a copy of this notice of exemption and NITU and request that it be vacated on a specified date. 
5. If an agreement for interim trail use/rail banking is reached by the 180th day after service of this notice of exemption
and NITU, interim trail use may be implemented. If no agreement is reached by that time, KCS may fully abandon the lines.

 

Decided: September 21, 1994.

Controlled Substances: Established Revised 1994 Aggregate Production Quotas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim notice establishing a 1994 aggregate production quota and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim notice establishes a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for methylphenidate, a Schedule II controlled
substance, as required under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

This is effective on September 27, 1994. Comments must be submitted on or before October 27, 1994.



</DATE>

Send comments or objections to the Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Attn:
DEA Federal Register Representative/CCR.



</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug &amp; Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington,
DC 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994).



The DEA established initial 1994 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II, including
methylphenidate, in a 

Federal Register

 notice published on October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52508). DEA revised some of the aggregate production quotas, including
that for methylphenidate, on June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32223) in accordance with 21 CFR 1303.13.

Since publication of the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas, DEA has received information which necessitates
an increase in methylphenidate's 1994 aggregate production quota. Because this increase is immediately required
to meet the 1994 year-end medical needs of the United States, an interim rule is being established.

Based on a review of 1993 year-end inventories, 1994 manufacturing quotas, 1994 sales, export requirements and other
information available to the DEA, the Deputy Administrator of the DEA, under the authority vested in the Attorney
General by section 306 of the CSA of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator by section 0.100 of title 28
of the Code of Federal Regulations, and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994),
hereby establishes the following revised 1994 aggregate production quota for methylphenidate, expressed in grams
of anhydrous base:





Basic Class_Established Revised
Schedule II_1994 Quotas
Methylphenidate_8,189,000





All interested persons are invited to submit their comments in writing regarding this interim notice.

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that his action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Season-All Industries Indiana, Pennsylvania; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration



On August 10, 1994, Local 

#

611 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the Department
of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for
workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on July 12, 1994 and published in
the 

Federal Register

 on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37996).

The union claims that Season-All's customers are now importing from Canada.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Notice of Certification
Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to workers of Sara Lee Knit Products
at the Cleveland Avenue plant in Martinsville, Virginia; Midway, Georgia; Cloverleaf Knitting in Martinsville,
Virginia; and the Distribution Center in Martinsville, Virginia. The certification notice was issued on August
26, 1994 and will soon be published in the Federal Register.

At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers producing men's, women's and
children's fleecewear at the subject firm. The findings show that production at Sara Lee Knit Products in Gretna,
Virginia was integrated with that of the Martinsville, Virginia plant. The Gretna plant will close by the end of September,
1994.

The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,089 through TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,092 is hereby issued as follows:





All workers of Sara Lee Knit Products, Martinsville, Virginia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,089) Gretna, Virginia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,089A)
Midway, Georgia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,090); Cloverleaf Knitting, Martinsville, Virginia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,091)
and the Central Distribution Center, Martinsville, Virginia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,092), respectively, who were
engaged in employment related to the production of men's, women's and children's fleecewear and provided administrative,
office, warehousing and distribution services who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after
June 27, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Wetterau/Supervalu, Bloomington, IN; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated August 11, 1994, the AFL&hyph;CIO Community Services on behalf of the workers requested administrative
reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistant (TAA). The denial notice was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36793).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The investigation files show that the workers do not produce an article within the meaning of Section 222(3) of the
Trade Act and this issue was fully addressed in the Department's negative determination. The workers performed wholesale
and retail services.

Only in very limited instances are service workers certified for TAA, namely, the worker separations must be caused
by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling firm whose workers produce an article and whose
workers are currently under a certification for TAA. These conditions were not met for the subject workers.

All other considerations which the union makes, i.e., declining net earnings and opening more stores to carry imported
food, are moot because the workers do not produce an article and as such are outside the scope of the Trade Act.

The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition
but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like
or directly competitive articles (not services) which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production
and employment at the workers' firm.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Changes in Status of Extended Benefit (EB) Periods for the States of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Washington</DOCTITLE>



This notice announces changes in benefit period eligibility under the Extended Benefit (EB) Program for the States
of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Washington.



Summary




The following changes have occurred since the publication of the last notice regarding States' EB status:

&bull;August 6, 1994&blank;Alaska's 13-week insured unemployment rate for the week ending July 16, 1994 fell below
6.0 percent and was less than 120 percent of the average for the corresponding period for the prior two years, causing
the State to trigger ``off'' EB effective August 6, 1994.

&bull;August 13, 1994&blank;Rhode Island triggered ``off'' EB. The EB trigger mechanisms for Rhode Island had been
below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on'' to EB since the week beginning June 5, 1994. However, Section
203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall
last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week
period ended for Rhode Island on August 13, 1994.

&bull;August 27, 1994&blank;The State of Washington triggered ``off'' EB. The EB trigger mechanisms for the State
had been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on'' to EB since the week beginning June 12, 1994. However,
as stated above, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 specifies
that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether or not the necessary thresholds
are met. That 13-week period ended for Washington on August 27, 1994.



Information for Claimants



The duration of benefits payable in the EB Program, and the terms and conditions on which they are payable, are governed
by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended, and the operating instructions
issued to the States by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the case of a State ending an EB period, the State employment
security agency will furnish a written notice to each individual who is filing claims for Extended Benefits informing
them of the ending of the EB period and its effect on the individual's right to Extended Benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(4)).

Persons who believe they may be entitled to EB benefits, or who wish to inquire about their rights under the programs,
should contact the nearest State employment service office or unemployment compensation claims office in their
locality.

By an application dated August 12, 1994, the United Steelworkers of America (USW) requested administrative reconsideration
of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on June 20, 1994 and published
in the

 on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33786).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:



(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.



The workers produce coated or painted aluminum coil.
Investigation findings show that the plant melted scrap aluminum cans and rolled the aluminum into coils which were
then painted. The smelter and rolling mill closed in December 1993. Currently the plant is painting only domestically
purchased coil.
Its claimed that imports of Russian aluminum ingots and coil affected the pricing of aluminum coil.
The articles produced by the subject workers is coated aluminum coil, not aluminum ingots or aluminum coil. Accordingly,
the Department must look at imports of coated aluminum coil. Granted, the price of domestic aluminum may have been
affected by imports of Russian aluminum. Price, however, is not one of the worker group criteria necessary for a worker
group certification. The Department's survey of Amerimark's customers shows that none of them reported increased
import purchases of coated aluminum coil while reducing their purchases from Amerimark during the period applicable
to the petition. Customer comments from the Department's survey indicated there were non-trade reasons for Amerimark's
customers reducing their purchases from Amerimark.
Other findings show that Amerimark did not purchase ingots (foreign or domestic) for use in its production process
for coated aluminum coil but purchased scrap aluminum cans. The scrap market is a different market from the London
Metals Exchange (LME).


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;286]</RINDOCK>



Power Authority of the State of New York; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact











The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, ``Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior to January 1,
1979,'' Section III.G.3, to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee) for the Indian Point Nuclear
Generating Unit No. 3 (IP3), located at the licensee's site in Westchester County, New York.




Environmental Assessment






Identification of Proposed Action






Section III.G.3 of the 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, specifies requirements to ensure that the alternate shutdown system
is independent of shutdown equipment that does not meet the requirements of Section III.G.2 of Appendix R. Section
III.G.2 of Appendix R specifies requirements to ensure that one train of redundant equipment necessary to achieve
and maintain hot shutdown remains free of fire damage.




During a programmatic review of the Fire Protection Program and Appendix R compliance strategy at Indian Point Nuclear
Generating Unit No. 3, the Power Authority of the State of New York identified that the alternate shutdown system did
not meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.3. Specifically, components in the alternate
shutdown system were located in the same fire area as redundant shutdown instrumentation cables which did not meet
the requirements of Section III.G.2 of Appendix R. 


The licensee has, therefore, requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.3,
to allow an operator to enter the fire area to perform manual actions.







Need for the Proposed Action





The proposed exemption is needed to permit the licensee to operate the plant without being in violation of the Commission's
regulations and to obviate the need for modifications. Physical modification of the plant to achieve compliance
with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.3, would require design changes, for example: wrapping one redundant
train of instrumentation cables in a 1 hour fire wrap, or relocation of the instrument isolation cabinets out of fire
area ETN&hyph;4 or the construction of the fire barriers to make the upper penetration area a separate fire area. The
detailed development and implementation of such design changes would result in a significant expenditure of engineering
and financial resources without a significant safety benefit.






Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action






Section III.G.3 of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, specifies requirements to ensure that the alternate shutdown system
is independent of shutdown equipment that does not meet the requirements of Section III.G.2 of Appendix R. Section
III.G.2 of Appendix R specifies requirements to ensure that one train of redundant equipment necessary to achieve
and maintain hot shutdown remains free of fire damage. The licensee has determined that the alternate shutdown system
does not meet these requirements because components in the alternate shutdown system were located in the same fire
area as redundant shutdown instrumentation cable which did not meet the requirements of Section III.G.2 of Appendix
R. The licensee has, therefore, requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.3,
to allow an operator to enter the fire area to perform manual actions.







Safe shutdown, during a postulated fire in the entryway tunnel, would be accomplished through use of the alternate
safe shutdown system. Process monitoring information to support use of the alternate shutdown system is routed to
the alternate safe shutdown locations through instrument isolation cabinets located in the upper electrical penetration
area. These cabinets provide the operators with the ability to interrupt the normal signal paths routed to the central
control room and reconfigure the instrument loops to provide instrument loop indication at the alternate safe shutdown
panels located outside of the control room. The instrument loops cannot be remotely reconfigured, necessitating
operator action in the fire affected area.



The fire hazard incurred by the operator during this action is minimal for several reasons. Because of the glass and
asbestos braid construction of the cables in these areas, fire is not expected to propagate along the cables to any
significant degree. A postulated fire in the entryway would be detected and extinguished, through manual or automatic
means, before the fire became extensive. Additionally, the distance from the fire to the cabinets is approximately
165 feet and, while in the fire affected area, an operator would not be in the immediate vicinity of the fire. Furthermore,
the operator would not be in the affected area for more than a few minutes and would access the area via the primary auxiliary
building, avoiding the vicinity of the fire. A smoke analysis has shown that the amount of smoke in the area would not
inhibit the necessary operator actions. Therefore, the proposed exemption would not affect the licensee's ability
to implement alternate safe shutdown procedures.



Based on the considerations discussed above, the Commission concludes that the proposed exemption would not affect
radiological plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational exposure. In addition, the exemption
does not affect nonradiological plan effluents and has no other environmental impact.



Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed exemption.





Alternatives to the Proposed Action





As an alternative to the proposed action, the Commission considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar. The alternative would also result in a significant expenditure of engineering
and financial resources, without a significant safety benefit.






Alternate Use of Procedures






This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
for the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Station Unit No. 3,'' dated February 1975.






Agencies and Persons Consulted





The Commission consulted with the State of New York regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.





Finding of No Significant Impact




The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the exemption under consideration.




Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.




For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated November 17, 1993, as supplemented
September 6, 1994. This document is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue,
White Plains, New York.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to the Addition of Listing Requirements to Prohibit Immediate Withdrawal of Units From Inclusion
on Nasdaq</DOCTITLE>


September 20, 1994.


On July 28, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 Thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change amends the listing requirements found in Parts II and III of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to include
additional requirements for units.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
The proposed rule change was initially submitted on June 21, 1994, and was amended twice prior to the publication of
the Notice; once on July 22, 1994, and again on July 28, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4.
</FOOTNOTE>


Under the rule as amended, in order to be included on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
Service (``Nasdaq''), units included for quotation on Nasdaq must continue to be included for a minimum period of
30 days from the first day of inclusion, barring suspension or withdrawal for regulatory purposes. The rule also requires
those issuers or underwriters seeking to withdraw units from inclusion to provide the NASD with notice of their intent
at least 15 days prior to withdrawal. In addition, an issuer of units will be required to include in its prospectus or
other offering document a statement disclosing any intention to withdraw the units immediately after the minimum
inclusion period.
Notice of the proposed rule change, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and by publication in the Federal Register

.

</FOOTNAME>
59 FR 42626 (August 18, 1994).
</FOOTNOTE>


No comments were received in response to the notice. This order approves the proposed rule change.
The new listing requirements have been proposed in response to the concerns of the NASD related to issuers that list
and then almost immediately thereafter withdraw units from inclusion after trading has commenced.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 As the NASD indicated in its rule filing, problems have arisen in instances where, shortly after certain units had
been included for quotation and trading had commenced, the issuers or their underwriters suddenly withdrew their
units from inclusion without any prior disclosure of their intention or advance notice to investors, market makers,
or Nasdaq. Because active trading in these securities had commenced with the expectation that the units would continue
to be included on Nasdaq, the sudden withdrawal from quotation significantly and adversely affected the market makers
and investors who traded in these securities.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
Generally, units are created by combining common stock of a corporation already quoted on Nasdaq with warrants for
the same common stock.
</FOOTNOTE>


The practice of immediate withdrawal of units from inclusion without adequate disclosure clearly poses harm to traders
and investors in these securities and adversely affects the integrity of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The practice leads
to confusion because market participants who have purchased the units are left without a liquid market in which to
trade these securities.
Moreover, if the lead underwriter involved in an offering also dominates or controls the market in the units, concerns
regarding manipulation of the security may arise. A sudden withdrawal may cause difficulties for investors and market
makers alike who may have established short positions in the units. These traders may be unable to cover their short
positions after the withdrawal has occurred, and are likely to be required to cover these short positions by purchasing
the components of the unit separately, frequently at a premium to the price originally being quoted prior to the withdrawal.
In fact, in situations where warrants have not been issued separately from the unit, it may be impossible to ``recreate''
the unit so as to cover the short position.
To address these concerns, the NASD's proposal makes three changes to its inclusion criteria for units. As noted,
for both Nasdaq Small Cap

SM

 units and National Market units, the proposal will impose a minimum 30-day period within which the units may not be
withdrawn, absent a legitimate regulatory interest in so doing. In addition, the amendment will require issuers
and underwriters seeking to withdraw units from inclusion to provide the NASD with at least 15 days notice of their
intention to withdraw, so that the NASD may provide adequate notice to investors and market makers before the withdrawal
occurs. Issuers having any intention to withdraw the units immediately after the minimum inclusion period also will
have to disclose their intention in the prospectus or other offering document.
The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, in part, that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices; to promote just and equitable principles of trade; to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest. The proposed rule change addresses concerns regarding the trading and inclusion process
for units and enhances the integrity of Nasdaq listings. With the minimum inclusion requirement of 30 days for units,
the amendment enhances the likelihood that an orderly trading market in these securities will exist. Similarly,
requiring both a 15-day advance notice of withdrawal and an adequate disclosure of an issuer's intention to withdraw
its units from inclusion promotes proper disclosure of information of use to all market participants.

Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Health Care
Portfolio Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS'').</DOCTITLE>


I. Introduction


September 20, 1994.


On April 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities of health care companies (``Health Care Portfolio'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 28, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On August 9, 1994, the NYSE filed Amendment No. 1 to the
proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.

</FOOTNAME>
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change provides that the value of the Health Care Portfolio will be calculated
continuously and disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') no less frequently than once
every minute throughout the trading day. See Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to
Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated
August 9, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').
</FOOTNOTE>


II. Description of the Proposal


Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities
which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the Health Care Portfolio
(``Health Care Portfolio MITTS'').
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>


See

 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29229 (May 23, 1991), 56 FR 24852 (May 31, 1991); and 28217 (July 18, 1990), 55
FR 30056 (July 24, 1990'') (``Hybrid Approval Orders'').

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
8

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission recently approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of MITTS based upon (1) a global portfolio
of securities representing telecommunications companies, and (2) a portfolio of European companies. See Securities
Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9, 1993); and 33368 (December 22, 1993),
58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993) (``MITTS Approval Orders'').
</FOOTNOTE>


As with the other MITTS products, the Health Care Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section
703.19 of the Manual, which provides that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million securities;
(2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million; and (5)
otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the Health Care Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the Exchange's continued
listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity,
and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Health Care Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive
an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio
Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Health Care Portfolio
on the date on which the issuer prices the Health Care Portfolio MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public.
The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values of the Health Care Portfolio at the end of the five
calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
9

</FOOTNAME>
The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good
standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing
standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01
and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically, the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000
holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares;
(2) a public float of 1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible assets
of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes of
$2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for the
last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required to be
profitable).

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
10

</FOOTNAME>
The continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) The number of holders of 100 shares or
more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3)
the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market
value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income
after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common
stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or
greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held
bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million. See Section 802 of the
Manual.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>
Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal average of the quarterly values of the Health Care Portfolio
beginning in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1998. The quarterly value for each of the first four of the final
five calendar quarters shall be the Health Care Portfolio value on the last scheduled Exchange trading day on which
there is no market disruption event. The quarterly value for the final calendar quarter shall be the Health Care Portfolio
Value on the seventh scheduled Exchange trading day preceding maturity of the Health Care MITTS unless there is a market
disruption event in which case the sixth trading day preceding maturity shall be used.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
12

</FOOTNAME>
The Health Care Portfolio MITTS will entitle a holder at maturity to receive for each $10 principal amount of MITTS
an amount equal to the Ending Average Portfolio Value of the Health Care Portfolio divided by 10, but in any event no
less than $9 per each $10 principal amount of Health Care Portfolio MITTS.
</FOOTNOTE>


If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the
principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount
payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the
principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio, but
does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Health Care Portfolio MITTS
are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership
right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate portfolio
value of the Health Care Portfolio securities.
According to the NYSE, Health Care Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the
principal amount of the MITTS with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities
representing 22 highly capitalized health care companies. Health Care Portfolio MITTS will mature on December 31,
1999.

The Health Care Portfolio consists of securities of 22 health care companies that have significantly different levels
of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $28.0 billion (Bristol Meyers Squibb Co.) to a low
of approximately $311 million (Living Centers of America, Inc.).
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Nineteen of the securities in the Health Care Portfolio are traded on the NYSE and the remainder are National Market
securities traded through NASDAQ. The average daily trading volume for the components of the Health Care Portfolio
for the period from November 5, 1992, through March 7, 1994, ranged from a high of approximately 1.03 million shares
(Abbott Laboratories), to a low of approximately 20,335 shares (Living Centers of America, Inc.).



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>
These values are as of March 7, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


At the outset, each of the securities in the Health Care Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents
an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number
of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ, to be included
in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 22 companies included in the Health Care Portfolio will
represent approximately 4.54 percent of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.

The multiplier for each security in the Health Care Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except for limited
adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
14

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will adjust the multiplier of any portfolio security if the security is subject to a stock split or reverse
split to equal the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the
prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the new multiplier will equal
the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security issued with respect to one
share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier.




</FOOTNOTE>


If the issuer of a security included in the Health Care Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger, acquisition
or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Merrill Lynch will assign to that security a value equal to
the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company included in
the portfolio is acquired by another company, Merrill Lynch shall thereafter assign a value to the shares of the acquired
company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition takes place.


If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency,
or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Health Care Portfolio so long as a
market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ for such security is available. If such a market price is no longer available
for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar
proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating
the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Health Care Portfolio, for so long as no such market
price exists for that security.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
15

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy
or a similar event.

</FOOTNOTE>


The value of the Health Care Portfolio will be calculated by an independent third party and will be disseminated through
OPRA at least one each minute throughout the trading day.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable
multipliers for the portfolio securities.





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
16

</FOOTNAME>
See Amendment No. 1, 

supra 

note 6.


</FOOTNOTE>


Like other issues of MITTS listed on the NYSE, Health Care Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and
are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Health Care Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out of their investment
by selling the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary
trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio and also
on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Health Care Portfolio, the time
remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the credit worthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
17

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Health Care Portfolio MITTS with its depository,
the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in
DTC.

Because Health Care Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE'S existing equity floor
trading rules will apply to the trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange
will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer
prior to trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the completion
of the transaction. Third, Health Care Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange.
Fourth, in accordance with the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading Health Care Portfolio
MITTS, distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in Health Care Portfolio MITTS and highlighting
the special risks and characteristics of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>

III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS
will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for health care securities. In particular, the
Commission believes that Health Care Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure in health care
companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed
in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission finds that the listing and trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS is consistent
with the Act.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See MITTS Approval Orders, 

supra

 note 8.

</FOOTNOTE>


As with other MITTS products, Health Care Portfolio MITTS are not leveraged instruments, however, their price will
still be derived and based upon the underlying linked security. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase
or sale of a Health Care Portfolio MITTS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common
stock. Nonetheless, because the final rate of return of a MITTS is derivatively priced, based on the performance of
a portfolio of securities, the Commission has several specific concerns regarding the trading of this type of product.

The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to Health Care Portfolio MITTS. In particular, by imposing the hybrid
listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes
the Exchange has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of Health Care
Portfolio MITTS. Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific
risks associated with Health Care Portfolio MITTS.

The Commission realizes that Health Care Portfolio MITTS are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer,
Merrill Lynch. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which require
issuers to maintain an aggregate market value of $5 million for its publicly-held shares.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Health Care Portfolio MITTS have at least
$4 million in market value. In any event, financial information regarding Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information
on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio, will be publicly available.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>

supra

 note 10.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
22

</FOOTNAME>
The companies that comprise the Health Care Portfolio are reporting companies under the Act.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Merrill Lynch, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of Health Care Portfolio MITTS issuance in relation to the net worth
of Merrill Lynch.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
23

</FOOTNAME>
See MITTS Approval Orders, 

supra

 note 8.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also believes that the listing and trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS should not unduly impact
the market for the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio. First, as discussed above, the underlying
securities comprising the portfolio are well-capitalized, highly liquid stocks. Second, because all of the components
of the Health Care Portfolio will initially be equally weighed, no single stock or group of stocks dominates the Health
Care Portfolio. Finally, the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio, are subject
to reporting requirements under the Act, and all of the portfolio securities are either listed or traded on, or traded
through the facilities of U.S. securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the NYSE's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
24

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission notes that 19 of the component securities are traded on the NYSE and the remainder are National Market
securities traded through Nasdaq.

</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the Commission notes that the value of the Health Care Portfolio will be disseminated at least once every
minute throughout the trading day. The Commission believes that this result is appropriate because, unlike previously
approved MITTS products which contain foreign components, the Health Care Portfolio is comprised solely of securities
traded in the U.S. for which real-time price information is available. The Commission believes that providing access
to the value of the Health Care Portfolio at least once every minute throughout the trading day is extremely important
and will provide benefits to investors in the product.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
25

</FOOTNAME>
In this regard, the Commission believes that it is useful and beneficial for all investors and market participants
to have access to the value of the Health Care Portfolio as frequently as possible and encourages the NYSE and Merrill
Lynch to further explore the possibilities in this area, 

i.e.,

 calculating and disseminating the value of the portfolio at least once every 15 seconds as is done with other derivative
products.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

. As discussed above, the Commission believes that investors and market participants will benefit from having the
value of the Health Care Portfolio calculated and disseminated as frequently as possible throughout the trading
day. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 provides this benefit without unduly burdening either the Exchange
or the issuer of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS. Additionally, the Commission notes that Amendment No. 1 provides
for significantly greater access by investors and market participants to current values of the Health Care Portfolio
than did the original proposal which was noticed for the full 21-day comment period without any comments being received
by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer
to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;14 and should be submitted by October 18, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Restructuring
Companies Portfolio Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS'')</DOCTITLE>


September 20, 1994.


I. Introduction


On April 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and
trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities of companies that have restructured or are in the process
of restructuring (``Restructuring Companies Portfolio'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 28, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On August 9, 1994, the NYSE filed Amendment No. 1 to the
proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.

The Restructuring Companies Portfolio is a static portfolio consisting of 17 equity securities listed as common
shares in the United States. The components of the portfolio represent companies which are generally perceived to
have recently experienced declines in earnings as compared to historical levels and/or other adverse developments
which have required some form of restructuring by such companies.

Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change provides that the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will
be calculated continuously and disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') no less frequently
than once every minute throughout the trading day. See Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary,
NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission,
dated August 9, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1'').

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Description of the Proposal


Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities
which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the Restructuring Companies
Portfolio (``Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS'').
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>
See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29229 (May 23, 1991), 56 FR 24852 (May 31, 1991); and 28217 (July 18, 1990),
55 FR 30056 (July 24, 1990) (``Hybrid Approval Orders'').

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
8

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission recently approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of MITTS based upon (1) A global portfolio
of securities representing telecommunications companies, and (2) a portfolio of European companies. See Securities
Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9, 1993); and 33368 (December 22, 1993),
58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993) (``MITTS Approval Orders'').

</FOOTNOTE>


As with the other MITTS products, the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines
under Section 703.19 of the Manual, which provide that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million
securities; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million;
and (5) otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the
Exchange's continued listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity,
and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at
maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending
Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value
of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices the Restructuring Companies Portfolio
MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values
of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the
Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
9

</FOOTNAME>
The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good
standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing
standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01
and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000
holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares;
(2) a public float of $1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible
assets of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes
of $2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for
the last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required
to be profitable).

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
10

</FOOTNAME>
The continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) The number of holders of 100 shares or
more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3)
the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market
value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income
after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common
stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or
greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held
bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million. 

See 

Section 802 of the Manual.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>
Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal the average of the quarterly values of the Restructuring
Companies Portfolio beginning in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1998. The quarterly value for each of the
first four of the final five calendar quarters shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio value on the last scheduled
Exchange trading day on which there is no market disruption event. The quarterly value for the final calendar quarter
shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio Value on the seventh scheduled Exchange trading day preceding maturity
of the Restructuring Companies MITTS unless there is a market disruption event in which case the sixth trading day
preceding maturity shall be used.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
12

</FOOTNAME>
The Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle a holder at maturity to receive for each $10 principal amount
of MITTS an amount equal to the Ending Average Portfolio Value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio divided by
10, but in any event no less than $9 per each $10 principal amount of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS.

If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the
principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount
payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will receive
90% of the principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio,
but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Restructuring Companies
Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any
other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the
aggregate portfolio value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio securities.

According to the NYSE, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of
a portion of the principal amount of the MITTS with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio
of securities representing 17 highly capitalized companies that either have restructured or are in the process of
restructuring. Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will mature on December 31, 1999.

The Restructuring Companies Portfolio consists of securities of 17 companies that have significantly different
levels of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $30. 2 billion (IBM) to a low of approximately
$328 million (Arkis, Inc.).
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Sixteen of the securities in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio are traded on the NYSE and one is a National Market
security traded through Nasdaq. The average daily trading volume for the components of the Restructuring Companies
Portfolio for the period from November 5, 1992, through March 7, 1994, ranged from a high of approximately 3.7 million
shares (Eastman Kodak), to a low of approximately 93,008 shares (The Columbia Gas System, Inc.).




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>
These values are as of March 7, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


At the outset, each of the securities in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents
an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number
of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ, to be included
in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 17 companies included in the Restructuring Companies
Portfolio will represent approximately 5.88 percent of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.

The multiplier for each security in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except
for limited adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
14

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will adjust the multiplier of any portfolio security if the security is subject to a stock split or reverse
split to equal the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the
prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the new multiplier will equal
the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security issued with respect to one
share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier.

</FOOTNOTE>


If the issuer of a security included in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason
of a merger, acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Merrill Lynch will assign to that
security a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example,
if a company included in the portfolio is acquired by another company, Merrill Lynch shall thereafter assign a value
to the shares of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition takes
place.

If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency,
or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Restructuring Companies Portfolio
so long as a market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ for such security is available. If such a market price is no
longer available for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency,
or any other similar proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection
with calculating the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio,
for so long as no such market price exists for that security.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
15

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy
or a similar event.

</FOOTNOTE>


The value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will be calculated by an independent third party and will be disseminated
through OPRA at least once each minute throughout the trading day.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable
multipliers for the portfolio securities.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
16

</FOOTNAME>
See Amendment No. 1, 

supra

 note 6.

</FOOTNOTE>


Like other issues of MITTS listed on the NYSE, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to
maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out
of their investment by selling the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security
in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Restructuring
Companies Portfolio and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the
Restructuring Companies Portfolio, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of
the issuer, Merrill Lynch.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
17

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS with its
depository, the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants
in DTC.

</FOOTNOTE>


Because Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE's existing
equity floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant
to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential
facts relating to every customer prior to trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the
completion of the transaction. Third, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin
rules of the Exchange. Fourth, in accordance with the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading
Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS, distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance with regard
to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions
in Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS and highlighting the special risks and characteristics of the Restructuring
Companies Portfolio MITTS.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>

III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Restructuring Companies
Portfolio MITTS will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for securities of companies that
have either recently restructured or are in the process of restructuring. In particular, the Commission believes
that Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure in such companies, while
at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed in the MITTS Approval
Orders, the Commission finds that the listing and trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS is consistent
with the Act.

As with other MITTS products, Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS are not leveraged instruments, however,
their price will still be derived and based upon the underlying linked security. Accordingly, the level of risk involved
in the purchase or sale of a Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase
or sale of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, because the final rate of return of a MITTS is derivatively priced,
based on the price performance of a portfolio of securities, the Commission has several specific concerns regarding
the trading of this type of product.

The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. In particular, by imposing
the hybrid listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission
believes the Exchange has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of
Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling
attention to the specific risks associated with Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS.

The Commission realizes that Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS are dependent upon the individual credit
of the issuer, Merrill Lynch. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards
which require issuers to maintain an aggregate market value of $5 million for its publicly-held shares.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS
have at least $4 million in market value. In any event, financial information regarding Merrill Lynch, in addition
to the information on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Restructuring Companies Portfolio,
will be publicly available.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
21

</FOOTNAME>
See supra note 10.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
22

</FOOTNAME>
The companies that comprise the Restructuring Companies Portfolio are reporting companies under the Act.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Merrill Lynch, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS issuance in relation
to the net worth of Merrill Lynch.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
23

</FOOTNAME>
See MITTS Approval Orders, 

supra 

note 8.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also believes that the listing and trading of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS should not
unduly impact the market for the underlying securities comprising the Restructuring Companies Portfolio. First,
as discussed above, the underlying securities comprising the portfolio are well-capitalized, highly liquid stocks.
Second, because all of the components of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will initially be equally weighted,
no single stock or group of stocks dominates the Restructuring Companies Portfolio. Finally, the issuers of the underlying
securities comprising the Restructuring Companies Portfolio, are subject to reporting requirements under the
Act, and all of the portfolio securities are either listed or traded on, or traded through the facilities of, U.S. securities
markets.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the NYSE's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
24

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission notes that 16 of the component securities are traded on the NYSE and one is a National Market security
traded through Nasdaq.

</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the Commission notes that the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio will be disseminated at least
once every minute throughout the trading day. The Commission believes that this result is appropriate because, unlike
previously approved MITTS products which contain foreign components, the Restructuring Companies Portfolio is
comprised solely of securities traded in the U.S. for which real-time price information is available. The Commission
believes that providing access to the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio at least once every minute throughout
the trading day is extremely important and will provide benefits to investors in the product.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
25

</FOOTNAME>
In this regard, the Commission believes that it is useful and beneficial for all investors and market participants
to have access to the value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio as frequently as possible and encourages the
NYSE and Merrill Lynch to further explore the possibilities in this area, 

i.e., 

calculating and disseminating the value of the portfolio at least once every 15 seconds as is done with other derivative
products.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day

. As discussed above, the Commission believes that investors and market participants will benefit from having the
value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio calculated and disseminated as frequently as possible throughout
the trading day. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 provides this benefit without unduly burdening either
the Exchange or the issuer of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS. Additionally, the Commission notes that
Amendment No. 1 provides for significantly greater access by investors and market participants to current values
of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio than did the original proposal which was noticed for the full 21-day comment
period without any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Eagle Financial Corp., Common
Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;9901</DOCTITLE>



September 21, 1994.



Eagle Financial Corp. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on August 23,
1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation/National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According to
the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:

(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist assigned to the stock on
the Amex;

(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's stockholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight;

(3) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market-makers and, in doing so, expand the capital base available for trading in its Common Stock; and

(4) The Company believes that firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS system will be included
to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports.

Any interested person may, on or before October 13, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (LSB Industries, Inc., Common
Stock, $.10 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;7677</DOCTITLE>



September 21, 1994.



LSB Industries, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's Common Stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on August 31,
1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its Common Stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Common Stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its Common Stock.

Any interested person may, on or before October 13, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been

protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

[Docket 44369; Order 94&hyph;9&hyph;31]



Exemption of Persons Who Contract for the Purchase of Blocks of Seats on Scheduled Service Pursuant to Applicable
Tariffs for Resale to the Public



Order to Show Cause



Summary



By this order, we are proposing to clarify the extent to which activities by contract bulk fare operators are covered
by the exemption granted to such persons by Order 88&hyph;9&hyph;2.



Background



By Order 81&hyph;7&hyph;109, the Civil Aeronautics Board (the Board) granted to persons who contract for blocks
of seats with U.S. and foreign direct air carriers a blanket exemption from the requirements of sections 401, 402,
and 403 of the Federal Aviation Act (the Act)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and of part 221 of the Board's regulations to the extent necessary to allow such persons, commonly referred to as ``contract
bulk fare operators,'' to resell the seats without filing tariffs or themselves having to obtain a certificate of
public convenience and necessity or a foreign air carrier permit, as applicable.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 By Order 88&hyph;9&hyph;2, the Department continued this exemption.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
Pub. L. 103&hyph;272, enacted July 5, 1994, revised and recodified the Federal Aviation Act within Subtitle VII of
Title 49 United States Code (Transportation) (the statute). For convenience in this order, we will refer both to the
old section numbers in the Act and the new section numbers in the statute. The applicable provisions of sections 401,
402, and 403 are now contained in Subpart II (Economic Regulation) of Subtitle VII.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
Under 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(2) (

see 

former section 101(3) of the Act), any person who engages, either directly or indirectly, in air transportation operations
is deemed to be an air carrier. 49 U.S.C. 40109 (

see 

former section 101(3)) provides that air carriers not directly engaged in the operation of aircraft (

i.e., 

``indirect'' air carriers) may be relieved from certain provisions of the statute to the extent and for such periods
as the Secretary of Transportation decides are in the public interest.



</FOOTNOTE>


Traditionally, the marketing arrangement authorized by this exemption has been utilized by direct air carriers
as an additional tool to enhance their marketing efforts but which is incidental to their overall scheduled service
operations. The blanket exemption allows these direct air carriers to contract to sell a portion of their seats to
middlemen (contract bulk fare operators). These contractors are then free to sell individual tickets to customers,
either with or without a ground package, at whatever price their business judgments dictate. The contractors generally
pay for the seats in advance and are sometimes subject to cancellation penalties for returning unsold seats.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The direct air carrier continues to market seats on these flights on its own behalf through the normal air transportation
distribution system.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Orders 80&hyph;2&hyph;112 and 81&hyph;7&hyph;109.



</FOOTNOTE>


The exemption is subject to certain disclosure and consumer protection provisions, specifically (a) that any direct
air carrier implementing such marketing programs shall file tariff rules that clearly describe the relationship
that exists between the direct air carrier and the passenger and that establish that, upon payment by the passenger,
the direct air carrier bears the responsibility for safeguarding the passenger's money; (b) that any direct air carrier
and any contractor operating under the exemption shall insure that consumers receive clear and conspicuous notice
before payment of any special contractual conditions imposed either by the contractor or by the direct air carrier
that are applicable to the passenger,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and (c) that any direct air carrier implementing these marketing programs in foreign air transportation must file
tariffs that state the prices to be charged to the contractor.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
4

</FOOTNAME>
These conditions include the following: the terms and amount of any cancellation penalties, fees for reservation
changes, or other special charges; limits on voluntary refunds_specifically, notice that clearly informs the passenger
of risks in the event of voluntary cancellation by stating the exact amount of the applicable refund for such cancellation;
limits on involuntary refunds, rerouting or ticket reissuance rights; limits on ticket endorsability or special
ticket purchase; check-in or reconfirmation requirements; if true, the fact that the passenger may be assessed price
increases after ticket purchase; if true, the fact that flight dates and times are not guaranteed at the time of purchase;
and information on the allocation of responsibility between the contractor and direct air carrier for the passenger's
funds and transportation. 

See 

Orders 86&hyph;9&hyph;61 and 88&hyph;9&hyph;2.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
5

</FOOTNAME>
Originally, the exemption granted by Order 81&hyph;7&hyph;109 also required that direct air carriers file with
the Board the names and addresses of each contractor. This condition was eliminated by Order 88&hyph;9&hyph;2.

Current Usage



We have recently been faced with two novel situations in which U.S. direct air carriers and their contractors are attempting
to avail themselves of this exemption.

In the first, the contractor uses the exemption to sell scheduled service in conjunction with an existing U.S. direct
air carrier pending Department action on the contractor's own application for certificate or commuter authority.
Indeed, the relationship between the contractor-applicant and the direct air carrier, while portrayed as a contract
bulk fare arrangement, in fact can be substantially more. The contractor-applicant may provide the ground handling,
may be involved in hiring personnel to staff the operation, and may even arrange for the aircraft to be used in the service.
The contract operations may also be in markets that are geographically distinct from the ``regular'' scheduled operations
of the direct air carrier. The situation is compounded by the fact that the direct air carrier may also register with
the Department to use the trade name of the contractor-applicant for these services.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Typically, all of these arrangements are scheduled to terminate upon the contractor-applicant's receipt of its
own operating authority.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
Part 215 of the Department's Regulations (14 CFR part 215) establishes a regulatory system of registration and notification
by air carriers who propose to use a trade name. Upon compliance with these requirements, use of the trade name is typically
allowed. However, the Department will not register a trade name when it is certain that use of such name would constitute
an unlawful holding out under 49 U.S.C. 41101(a) (

see

 former section 401(a) of the Act) or there is a significant potential for, or actual, public confusion or other unfair
or deceptive practices prohibited by 49 U.S.C. 41712 (

see

 former section 411 of the Act). If the registration of an air carrier trade name will help effectuate an arrangement
that will unlawfully circumvent our fitness standards, we have the authority to reject the name registration.

</FOOTNOTE>


In the second situation, the U.S. direct air carrier and contractor seek to convert an existing Public Charter program
in which they are parties to scheduled service through use of the contract bulk fare exemption. Often, the direct air
carrier holds charter-only authority and files an application with the Department seeking scheduled authority
in order to operate under a contract bulk fare arrangement. In some cases, the operations represented by the contract
bulk fare arrangement constitute most, if not all, of the scheduled operations proposed by the direct air carrier.
In general, these operations are indistinguishable from charter flights, except that the contractor and direct
air carrier are not subject to the consumer protection requirements applicable to Public Charter flights contained
in 14 CFR part 380. Those rules require, among other things, the establishment of escrow accounts and surety arrangements
for the protection of passenger funds, and the signing of operator-participant contracts that detail the rights
and obligations of the passenger, charter operator, and direct air carrier.

Common to both situations is the fact that, in markets covered by the bulk fare contract, the contractor has agreed
to buy the entire, or virtually the entire, capacity of the aircraft and is responsible for all of the marketing of that
capacity. Normally, the direct air carrier does not perform any marketing function and does not sell air transportation
on its own behalf in the markets covered by the contract. Rather, its sole function is to operate the aircraft for which
it is paid a set price.



Discussion



The statute establishes a regulatory framework for conducting air transportation operations that balances a liberal
entry policy for new air carriers, both direct and indirect, with Congress' concern for operational safety and consumer
protection. Under the statute, a person who wants to engage in air transportation of passengers has two choices; either
be found fit as an airline (

i.e., 

direct air carrier) or qualify as an indirect air carrier. In the case of the person who seeks to operate as a U.S. direct
air carrier, that person has to meet a three-part test of demonstrating that it has the managerial competence, financial
capability, and compliance disposition to operate the proposed airline safely and without imposing an undue risk
on the public.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Until the Department finds that the applicant is fit to operate and it is issued appropriate direct air carrier authority,
it is prohibited from advertising or otherwise holding out its services to the public (

see

 14 CFR 201.5). The intent of this rule is to prevent companies who have not or cannot meet the Department's rigorous
fitness test from collecting money from potential passengers, thus exposing them to financial risks. While ultimately
many applicants may be found fit and given U.S. direct air carrier authority, often this is not before a number of substantive
changes have been made in the management team, ownership structure, or financial arrangements undertaken by the
applicant. To allow such applicants to commence operations under the guise of a contract bulk fare arrangement prior
to being found fit poses a potentially serious risk to consumers that we believe is not in the public interest.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>
The applicant must also demonstrate that it is a U.S. citizen as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(15) (

see 

former section 101(16) of the Act).

</FOOTNOTE>


In the case where an entity does not want to operate as a direct air carrier or its agent, but still wants to market air
transportation on its own behalf, it is not subject to a fitness review, but must comply with the requirements that
the Department has established to ensure that consumer funds and expectations are protected. This means complying
with the consumer protection provisions of the Public Charter rules (14 CFR part 380) or, in limited circumstances,
the conditions of the contract bulk fare exemption.

In our view, the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes the typical contract bulk fare marketing arrangement
contemplated in the exemption from the two situations described above lies in who is the true ``operator'' of the services
in an economic sense_who has control. In the typical contract bulk fare arrangement, that control rests with the direct
air carrier. Although the contractor assumes the risk for those seats that it has purchased from the direct air carrier,
the direct air carrier has control over the scheduling of the flights involved, allocation of seat inventory, and
ultimate responsibility for safeguarding the passengers' money. Moreover, since a contract bulk fare arrangement
is merely one of a number of marketing tools used by a direct air carrier, that arrangement would be incidental to the
overall scheduled operations of the direct air carrier. The risk of exposure to the direct air carrier from one contractor
would therefore also be limited.

On the other hand, in the contractor-applicant and charter-conversion situations, the contractor is the ``true''
operator in an economic sense, and the purported contract bulk fare arrangements are the driving force behind the
operation. Although the direct air carrier is responsible for the operation of the flight, the contractor controls
the scheduling, allocation of inventory, and price, and bears that risk for marketing most, if not the total capacity,
of the aircraft. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to distinguish these operations from those performed
by a direct air carrier under a wet lease arrangement or by a charter operator under the Public Charter rules. More importantly,
if the contract bulk fare operator should for any reason fail to remit collected funds, the direct air carrier nevertheless
ultimately bears the responsibility to the passengers for either providing the air transportation or paying refunds.
While this may not pose any undue risk in the case of a carrier with other substantial operations, in the situations
described above, the amount of monies for which the direct air carrier could be held liable may be so great as to endanger
its own economic viability and ultimately adversely affect its other customers.



Decision



We continue to believe that the contract bulk fare concept can be a valuable marketing tool for direct air carriers,
and, where properly used, that the conditions imposed in our exemption orders provide adequate protection for consumers.
However, when the Board originally granted_and we continued_the contract bulk fare exemption, it was envisioned
that this authority would be used by existing scheduled carriers as a tool to expand their marketing capabilities,
and that such contracts would be incidental to their other scheduled operations. It was not envisioned that applicants
for direct air carrier authority could use the contract bulk fare mechanism as a means of ``jump-starting'' their
proposed operations prior to being found fit, or that these arrangements would be used as a means of avoiding the Public
Charter consumer protection requirements. Thus, it is our view that the two situations described above were not intended
to be covered by the exemption granted by Orders 81&hyph;7&hyph;109 and 88&hyph;9&hyph;2. More importantly, the
arrangements have the potential to create great risks for consumers, since they could be used to circumvent our fitness
requirements or the consumer protection provisions of our charter rules.

Therefore, we have tentatively decided to amend the exemption to require that the direct air carrier be, as discussed
above, the ``true'' operator of the service in an economic sense and the contract bulk fare arrangement be incidental
to that carrier's overall scheduled operations. The direct air carrier may not use a contract bulk fare arrangement
as the only means of holding out its scheduled services, but must, in fact, be holding out on its own behalf the scheduled
air services that are also being sold under the contract bulk fare arrangement. Practically speaking, this means
that the direct air carrier would be responsible for holding out scheduled service in its own name through the traditional
marketing mechanisms of the industry, such as listing its flights in the Official Airline Guides or major computer
reservations systems, or using travel agents or advertisements.

We do not wish to preclude the customary use by direct air carriers of the contract bulk fare exemption in the many resort
or vacation markets in which they currently use it as an additional tool to expand the marketing of their scheduled
service by selling seats to tour or cruise operators for packaging and resale. The direct air carriers involved in
the these situations typically have extensive scheduled service operations elsewhere and the particular services
involved in the contract bulk fare arrangement are under the ultimate economic control of the direct air carrier.
We would consider these operations to be incidental to the overall scheduled operations of the direct air carrier
even if it were to result in the sale of a large portion or even a majority of the seats in a particular market. In such circumstances,
the contract bulk fare operations would not pose an undue risk to consumers or to the direct air carrier.

While we have been considering a clarification of the existing exemption, we have taken no action against contract
bulk fare arrangements in which contractors could sell up to 85 percent of the seats on each flight in the markets in
question.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 However, such arrangements would not be permitted in the future to the extent that they are inconsistent with the policies
we are proposing here. We will, however, consider requests for individual exemptions in specific cases. Moreover,
in reviewing applications to register trade names and for new scheduled authority, we propose to apply the policies
expressed in this order. Thus, if we are convinced that the use by a direct air carrier of the trade name of a contractor
would constitute an unlawful holding out under section 41101(a) or should there be a significant potential for, or
actual, public confusion or other unfair or deceptive practices prohibited by section 41712, we would not register
the trade name for the direct air carrier. Nor would we approve an initial scheduled service application for U.S. certificate
or commuter authority which relies primarily on a contract bulk fare arrangement as the underlying basis for the proposed
scheduled operations.

See, e.g., Orders 94&hyph;6&hyph;39, Mahalo Air, Inc., and 94&hyph;3&hyph;38, Great American Airways, Inc. In
those orders, we also noted our concerns over the use of contract bulk fare arrangements as the primary means of marketing
specific scheduled services, and indicated our intent to re-examine and clarify our policies with regard to such
arrangements.

Request for Comments



Copies of the Programmatic Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) are available
as described under ADDRESSES.

in view of the comments. If revisions are warranted, availability of the revised documents will be announced by a later
notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Background



As required by Congress, the Coast Guard is preparing to install the equipment necessary to implement a Differential
Global Positioning System (DGPS) services in the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor area of the United States. DGPS is a new
radionavigation service that improves upon the 100 meter accuracy of the existing Global Positioning System (GPS)
to provide an accuracy of better than 10 meters. For vessels, this degree of accuracy is critical for precise electronic
navigation in harbors and harbor approaches and will reduce the number of vessel grounding, collisions, personal
injuries, fatalities, and potential hazardous cargo spills resulting from such incidents.


After extensive study, the Coast Guard has selected five sites along the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor coastline for
the DGPS equipment. The sites are in the vicinity of Aransas Pass, TX; Galveston, TX; English Turn, LA; Mobile Point,
AL; and Egmont Key, FL. The sites are already used for related purposes and were chosen, in part, because their proposed
use is consistent with their past and present use, thus minimizing further impact on the environment. DGPS signal
transmissions will be broadcast in the marine radiobeacon frequency band (283.5 to 325 KHz) using less than 50 watts
(effective radiated power). Signal transmissions at these low frequency and power levels have not been found to be
harmful to the surrounding environment.



Proposed Installations at Each Site



(a) Radiobeacon Antenna_The Coast Guard proposes to use either an 80 foot whip antenna or install a 90 foot guyed antenna
with an accompanying ground plane. A ground plane for these antenna's consists of approximately 120 copper radials
(6 gauge copper wire) installed 6 inches (or less) beneath the soil and projecting outward from the antenna base. The
optimum radial length is between 200&hyph;300 feet, but this length may be shortened to fit within property boundaries.
Wherever possible, a cable plow method will be used in the radial installation to minimize soil disturbance. Installation
of the ground plane may require some clearing of trees and bushes on the site.


(b) DGPS Antennas_Each site will require two 10 foot masts to support four small (4 inches by 18 inches diameter) receiving
antennas. The masts will be installed on a concrete foundation measuring approximately 3 feet by 3 feet by 15 inches.
These masts are needed to support the primary and backup reference receivers and integrity monitors. The location
of the two masts will be in the vicinity of the electronic equipment building or hut, but at least 50 feet to 100 feet from
existing structures. (At Mobile Point, AL, mast height must be increased from 10 feet to approximately 20 feet to ensure
the visibility of satellites is not blocked by existing structures. The mast foundations will be 5 feet 3 inches by
5 feet 3 inches by 4 feet and will be mounted right next to the transmitter building to minimize disturbance to the area.)

(c) Equipment shelter_Existing radiobeacon equipment shelters will be used at each site to house the DGPS equipment.

(d) Utilities_The Coast Guard proposes to use available commercial power as the primary source for the electronic
equipment. However, existing diesel generators are available and may be utilized if backup power is needed. Telephone
service is required at each site for remote monitoring and operation.

Galveston Bay. This site has previously been partially upgraded and is transmitting prototype DGPS signals for test
and evaluation purposes.
English Turn, LA_The site is collocated at the USCG Communication Station, which is approximately 10 miles Southeast
of New Orleans. This site has previously been partially upgraded and is transmitting prototype DGPS signals for test
and evaluation purposes.
Mobile Point, AL_The site is collocated at the Mobile Point Light, which is adjacent to Fort Morgan. Fort Morgan is
listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Coast Guard and AL State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
agree that the proposed project will have no effect on the adjacent fort.
Egmont Key, FL_Located approximately 5 miles Southwest of St. Petersburg at the entrance to Tampa Bay. This radiobeacon
transmitting site is collocated at the Egmont Key Lighthouse, which is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. This site has previously been partially upgraded and is transmitting prototype DGPS signals for test and
evaluation purposes in conjunction with the State of Florida. The Coast Guard and FL State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) agree that the proposed project will have no effect on the adjacent lightstation.
Implementation of a DGPS service in the Gulf Intercoastal Corridor Region is determined to have no significant effect
on the quality of the human environment or require preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.

ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing the availability of a study entitled ``The Performance
of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats'' (the study). Because of the FAA's concern that
some child restraint systems that work well in automobiles may not provide the level of protection desirable in airplanes,
the FAA conducted a study to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of child restraint devices on airplanes. The
FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and when further studies are completed, they will be made available
to the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1992, the FAA set forth in &sect;&sect;91.107(a), 121.311(b), 125.211(b), and 135.128(a) the child restraint
systems acceptable for use in aircraft by listing labeling requirements and certain use requirements. The FAA's
1992 determination as to which child restraint systems would be approved for use aboard aircraft was based on many
years of work by both the FAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In the mid 1980's, the
FAA and NHTSA undertook an effort to develop a common approach to the approval of child restraints. NHTSA Standard
213 was amended to provide criteria for the certification of child restraints that were appropriate for both aircraft
and automobiles.



NHTSA Standard 213, as revised, is the current U.S. standard, and has allowed hundreds of models of seats to be approved.
The current FAA child restraint rules do not specifically refer to NHTSA Standard 213. However, NHTSA Standard 213
is the basis for the labels required under the FAA rules.

Because of the FAA's concern that some child restraint systems that work well in automobiles may not provide the level
of protection desirable in airplanes, the FAA conducted a study to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of child
restraint devices on airplanes, to respond to questions from the Air Transport Association concerning which child
restraint systems were approved for aircraft, and to respond to comments received from child restraint manufacturers,
private testing organizations, the National Transportation Safety Board, foreign regulatory organizations,
and consumer activists. The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and when further studies are completed,
they will be made available to the public.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received requests for exemptions from or waivers of compliance with a requirement of its safety standards. The
individual petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved,
and the nature of the relief being requested. 
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before, October
31, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered
as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9:00 a.m._5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington,
D.C. 20590. 
The individual petitions seeking an exemption or waiver of compliance are as follows: 


Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13 


Metra seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part
229) for Electric MU Locomotives and Non-MU Control Cab Locomotives. Metra is seeking relief from the requirements
of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. Metra
requests that the compliance date be extended to July 1, 1996. 
The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on 
July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by
May 5, 1995. The railroad states that event recorders will be installed on existing equipment by retrofit and by an
outside rebuilding program. In addition, new cars to be delivered will be equipped when built. The schedule for these
activities extend to 
July 1, 1996, making the May 5, 1995, compliance date unattainable. 


Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;7 


SEPTA seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part
229). SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirement of &sect;229.5(g) that:



Event recorders monitor and record data: over the most recent 48 hours of operation of the electrical system of the
locomotive on which it is installed.



SEPTA states that a railroad supervisor can get to the scene of any accident on their system within one hour. They feel
that 8 hours of recorded information is sufficient for any accident investigation on their railroad. SEPTA's event
recorders are solid state devices which record each change in state. With their present recorder system a printed
copy of the stored information fills about 73 pages. To accommodate 48 hours of recorded information would result
in a very extensive printed copy with no additional useful information. FRA has previously ``grandfathered'' event
recorders which were in service on 
July 8, 1993, and which recorded only 8 hours of data. 


Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;8 


SEPTA seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part
229) for Electric MU Locomotives. SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains
operating over 
30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. SEPTA requests the compliance date be extended to 
December 7, 1995. 
The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on 
July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by
May 5, 1995. The railroad states that off-the-shelf event recorders will be installed on conventional (non-MU locomotives)
locomotives within the specified time, however, new design event recorders will be required for the Electric MU Locomotives.
SEPTA is requesting seven additional months for the design, manufacture and installation of event recorders on their
MU locomotive fleet.

Metro-North Commuter Railroad (MNCW) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;10 


MNCW seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part
229) for their locomotives. MNCW is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating
over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by 
May 5, 1995. MNCW requests the compliance date be extended to 
December 5, 1997. 
The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on 
July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by
May 5, 1995. The railroad states that off-the-shelf event recorders will be installed on conventional (non-MU locomotives)
locomotives within the specified time, however, new design event recorders will be required for the Electric MU Locomotives.
MNCW is requesting two years additional time for the design, procurement, manufacture and installation of event
recorders on their locomotive fleet of 413 units to be equipped. The railroad cites funding, FRA and State-mandated
purchasing practices, non-availability of off-the-shelf event recorders for electric rail cars, impact on car
availability, limited physical plant and energy conservation/cost savings as the justification for the delay.
MNCW estimates that 43 percent of their fleet will be equipped with event recorders by May 5, 1995. 


The Western Railway Museum (WRM) 


(Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;9) 


The WRM, of Suisun City, California, seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety
Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one caboose. The caboose is used for educational purposes only and is operated
at speeds of 15 mph or less in a rural area with no history of vandalism. 


The Ohio Central Railroad Company (OHCR) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;10 


The OHCR on behalf of their affiliate Ohio Southern Railroad, Incorporated (OSRR), seeks a permanent waiver of compliance
with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part 223) for one caboose. The caboose, 
OHCR 553, a former New York Central all-steel caboose was rebuilt in the 1960's by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad
and is not equipped with FRA certified glazing. The OSRR operates between South Zanesville and Glass Rock, a distance
of approximately 19 miles. An out of service line extends 14 miles from East Fultonham Junction to New Lexington, Ohio.
The railroad states there is no record of vandalism regarding train movements. Train speed is limited to 5 mph in this
rural area. Two trains are operated per week and mostly in day light hours. 


Owego Harford Railway (OHRY) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM 94&hyph;11 


The OHRY seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part
223) for one locomotive. The locomotive, an EMD Model GP&hyph;9, is equipped with FRA certified glazing in the front
and rear locations but not in the side windows. The railroad states there has been no vandalism in this rural area. The
OHRY operates between Owego and Harford, New York, a distance of approximately 30 miles. 



Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (PW) 


Waiver Petition Docket Numbers RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;12 and SA&hyph;94&hyph;6 


The PW seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part
223) for one locomotive. Locomotive PW 150 is a 25-ton diesel electric industrial switcher built by General Electric
which was recently purchased to provide service on an industrial track which cannot accommodate a full size locomotive.
This operation is on 
one-half mile of track at the end of the Bell Dock Railroad at New Haven Terminal, Connecticut. In addition, PW is restoring
a section of track for a customer in South Providence, Rhode Island, and the locomotive will be used at that location.
The locomotive is now equipped with new laminated safety glass. 


PW seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards 
(49 CFR Part 231) for Locomotive PW 150. Section 231.30 specifies requirements for locomotives used in switching
service. PW requests relief from the requirements of this section since the locomotive was built without corner stairway
openings and switching steps. The railroad states that a crew member would be either in the locomotive cab, on the cars
or walking next to the equipment when in the street. Thus, safety is not compromised by non-compliance with Section
231.30. 


Nash County Railroad (NCYR) 


Waiver Petition Docket Number RSGM 94&hyph;13 


The NCYR seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR Part
223) for four locomotives. The NCYR operates over approximately 20 miles of track between Spring Hope and Rocky Mount,

Rules Standards &amp; Instructions Application (RS&amp;I&hyph;AP) No. 1093 




Applicant: 

Norfolk Southern Corporation, Mr. B.L. Sykes, General Manager Signal and Electrical, 99 Spring Street, S.W., Atlanta,
Georgia 30303.



The Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) seeks relief from the requirements of the Rules, Standard and Instructions,
49 CFR, 
Part 236, Section 236.377, 236.378, 236.379, 236.380, and 236.381, to the extent that NS not be required to perform
the associated locking tests if a plug-in type relay is replaced with another relay and the following requirements
are met: 
1. The replacing relay is of the same drawing number as the relay being replaced; 
2. The contacts of the replacing relay are verified to be of the correct arrangement for the drawing number; 
3. Registration plates for the correct drawing number are in place and functional on both the plug board and the replacing
relay; 
4. If the relay is a biased type, voltage of the incorrect polarity must be applied to the coil to verify that the relay
will not operate; and 
5. Replacing relay is correctly mounted on the plug board. 

The applicant's justification for relief is that a fail-safe device has been built to enable a simple test/verification
procedure of a relay to be performed accurately and quickly. This will enable the signal system to be restored to service
quickly in the event of a relay failure without disarrangement. 


RS&amp;I&hyph;AP No. 1094 




Applicant: 

Florida East Coast Railway Company, Mr. M.E. Deputy,
Vice President Transportation, One Malaga Street, P.O. Box 1048, St. Augustine, Florida 32085&hyph;1048.

in automatic train control (ATC) territory, in accordance with Centralized Traffic Control System rules as defined
by FEC Operating Rules and 49 CFR, part 236, &sect;236.567. 
The applicant's justification for relief is that it is not economically feasible to equip run-through foreign power
with ATC equipment, and it will improve train handling and customer satisfaction. 

Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of an application shall set forth specifically the grounds
upon which the protest is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the protestant in the proceeding.
The original and two copies of the protest shall be filed with the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh
Street, S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20590 within 45 calendar days of the date of issuance of this notice. Additionally, one copy of the
protest shall be furnished to the applicant at the address listed above. 
FRA expects to be able to determine these matters without oral hearing. However, if a specific request for an oral hearing
is accompanied by a showing that the party is unable to adequately present his or her position by written statements,
an application may be set for public hearing.

Background






Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register.

 

G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;007) petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.

the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 84 is the vehicle
eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this notice of final decision.



Final Decision



Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby decides that a 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE (Model ID 124.043)
is substantially similar to a 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE originally manufactured for importation into and sale in
the United States and certified under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable
of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Western Cascade of Seattle, Washington (Registered Importer 94&hyph;23) has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether
1988 Volvo 740 Sedans are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which Western Cascade believes
is substantially similar is the 1988 Volvo 740 Sedan that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United
States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1988 Volvo 740 Sedan to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
Western Cascade submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1988
Volvo 740 Sedan, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same
manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1988 Volvo 740 Sedan is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<DOCTITLE>Denial of Motor Vehicle Petition</DOCTITLE>


This notice sets forth the reasons for denial of a petition submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) under Section 30162 of Chapter 301, Title 49, United States Code (formerly Section 124 of the National Traffic
and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Act)).
Mr. Lawrence J. Hutchens, an attorney representing Ms. Gloria Ody-Costello, petitioned the Administrator of NHTSA
with respect to the automatic transmission dipstick and dipstick tube on all 1994 Mercury Cougar model vehicles.
The petitioner maintains that when the subject vehicle is brought to a sudden stop, transmission fluid spills out
of the dipstick tube and ignites on the catalytic converter located below the tube. The petitioner requests that NHTSA
order the recall of all 1994 Mercury Cougars for the installation of a clamp to be installed on the subject dipstick
to retain the dipstick in the dipstick tube in a more positive manner and ``look into'' relocating or increasing the
length of the dipstick tube.
Mr. Hutchens' petition specifically calls for the recall of all 1994 Mercury Cougars vehicles. According to the Vehicle
Identification Number (VIN) provided by Mr. Hutchens, Ms. Ody-Costello owns a 1993 Mercury Cougar, which is equipped
with an automatic transmission and 5.0 liter V&hyph;8 engine. Mr. Hutchens states in his letter that Ms. Ody-Costello
took her vehicle into a Ford dealer for unspecified transmission repairs. When the vehicle was returned to Ms. Ody-Castello,
the transmission dipstick was allegedly not pushed completely into the top of the dipstick tube, which left the top
of the dipstick tube partially open. Also, according to Mr. Hutchens, this condition allowed automatic transmission
fluid to spill onto the catalytic converter during sudden braking and ignite. There is no mention of any damage to the
vehicle as a result of such ignition. As the vehicle owned by Ms. Ody-Costello is actually a 1993 model, this model was
also included in the NHTSA analysis.
Mr. Hutchens suggests three corrective actions in his letter:
1. Install a clamp on the dipstick tube to hold the dipstick in a more positive manner.
2. Relocate the dipstick tube, so that the opening of the tube is not above the catalytic converter.
3. Increase the length of the tube, to raise the opening of the tube into a higher location in the engine compartment.
The 1993 and 1994 Mercury Cougar are available with two engine options, either a 5.0 liter V&hyph;8 or a 3.8 liter V&hyph;6.
Both the 1993 and 1994 models are equipped with the same dipstick and have the same dipstick tube location, regardless
of engine size. The dipstick tube runs upward from the transmission to a location near the rear corner of the right side
engine valve cover, where the dipstick is inserted into the tube. The opening of the tube is located about 12 inches
above the heat shield that surrounds one of the engine's catalytic converters.
The upper end of the dipstick is fitted with a metal cap that fits over the top of the dipstick tube. This cap is about 1/2
inch deep. Inside the cap and extending about 1/2 inch from the opening of the cap is a rubber seal that closes the opening
of the dipstick tube. This seal is basically a rubber plug that fits snugly into the opening. The plug portion is tapered
for the first 1/4 inch to facilitate its entry into the opening of the tube. According to Ford Motor Company (Ford),
when the dipstick is inserted into the dipstick tube properly, so that the metal cap seats over the end of the tube, the
rubber plug will provide a seal that will prevent any transmission fluid from spilling from the tube under all foreseeable
driving conditions, including sudden or panic stops. Instructions in the Cougar owner's manual, contained in the
glove compartment of all new vehicles, advise the owner to make sure the dipstick is fully seated when checking transmission
fluid. The owner's manual also warns against overfilling of the transmission and instructs the owner to have any excess
fluid removed from the transmission if the fluid ever exceeds the recommended level.
A search of the Office of Defects Investigation's (ODI) consumer complaint file disclosed no other reports of fluid
spilling from the automatic transmission dipstick tube in either 1993 or 1994 Mercury Cougars. As the automatic transmission
dipstick in the 1993 and 1994 Cougar is identical or very similar to the dipstick is most other Fords products, a search
of ODI's consumer complaint file was also conducted involving all Ford vehicles from 1990 through 1994. Again, no
complaints of transmission fluid spilling from the automatic transmission dipstick tubes were located. Ford was
also contacted and reported that Ms. Ody-Costello's complaint was the only one it has received involving the subject
transmission dipstick.

Mr. John R. Jackson, represented by Mr. Hutchens as an expert witness, was retained by Mr. Hutchens to inspect the Ody-Costello
vehicle. According to Mr. Jackson's report, a one-page letter, when he first inspected the Ody-Costello vehicle,
the transmission was overfilled. In spite of this overfilled condition, when Mr. Jackson examined the underside
of the vehicle and the area surrounding the transmission dipstick tube, he reported that there was no evidence that
any oil had spilled or was spilling from the dipstick tube. With the transmission in the overfilled condition, the
owner pulled the dipstick out, so that the opening of the dipstick tube was ``partially'' open. When the vehicle was
brought to two sudden stops in this condition, transmission fluid reportedly spilled from the dipstick tube on both
occasions and was ignited by the exhaust system. This test was repeated two more times, after the excess transmission
fluid was removed (with the dipstick tube still partially open), with the same result.

After the four previously described tests, a final test was conducted. According to Mr. Jackson's report, ``the dipstick
was then properly installed and the test repeated.'' In the final test, there was no ignition, although Mr. Jackson
did report that there were ``several spots of fluid along that path traveled by the decelerating vehicle. Mr. Jackson
did not explain in his report, whether these spots could have come from residual oil that had possibly leaked during
the four previous tests, when the dipstick tube was intentionally left partially open, nor did he indicate that the
vehicle was inspected for the presence of any residual oil or that the area around and under the dipstick tube was cleaned
after any of the previous tests. There was also no indication in the report that these spots were verified actually
to be transmission fluid from Ms. Ody-Costello's vehicle.

Ms. Ody-Costello also demonstrated the problem for Mr. David Horowitz, the host of a syndicated television show,
that deals with consumer issues. During the test conducted for Mr. Horowitz, the transmission dipstick also was not
seated into the transmission dipstick tube. This condition resulted in a partial opening of the dipstick tube, although
this fact was not mentioned by Mr. Horowitz in his broadcast (Mr. Hutchens submitted a video tape of the segment of Mr.
Horowitz's show dealing with the Ody-Costello vehicle).

In an effort to better understand petitioner's allegations and particularly to verify Mr. Jackson's testing, ODI
conducted an informal test program involving four 1993/1994 Mercury Cougar vehicles.

All four vehicles were randomly selected from the inventory of two large metropolitan dealership. Two were new vehicles
with less than 50 miles recorded on the odometer and two were used vehicles. The vehicles were first inspected both
in the engine compartment and under the vehicle for any evidence of oil spillage from the transmission dipstick tube.
None of the vehicles showed any signs of oil leakage or spillage and were clean and free from any oil residue in the area
beneath and surrounding the transmission dipstick tube. All four vehicles were then driven for approximately 30
minutes to bring the transmission up to normal operating temperature. Each vehicle was then inspected and the transmission
fluid levels checked according to the manufacturer's instructions from the vehicle owner's manual. The dipstick
has a crosshatched area, not quite 3/4 inches long, near its lower extremity. The manufacturer recommends that the
fluid level fall within this area when the transmission fluid is at operating temperature. The fluid level in all four
vehicles fell within 1/8 inch of the uppermost limit of the crosshatched area of the dipstick. All were topped off as
necessary to bring the fluid level to the top of the crosshatched area. It is also noted that there is a warning stamped
into the dipstick immediately above the crosshatched area reading ``DON'T ADD.''

With the transmission dipsticks in place and seated into the dipstick tube according to the manufacturer's instructions,
the uppermost area of the transmission dipstick tube, from 3 inches below the opening of the tube, was next loosely
wrapped with paper toweling. This wrap extended above the top of the tube and around the handle portion of the dipstick
above the cup containing the dipstick tube seal. The toweling was retained in position with masking tape.

Each vehicle was then driven for approximately 15 miles in stop and go traffic and for a second 15 miles at highway speeds
of 55 to 65 mph. The vehicles were then subjected to braking in a large, level parking lot. The asphalt surface of the
lot was dry and the ambient temperature was 87 degrees F. Each vehicle was driven along a straight path and brought up
to a speed of 50 mph, at which time the brakes were applied as firmly as possibly, bringing the vehicle to a sudden panic-type
stop. (Although the test vehicles were not equipped with anti-lock brakes, as was the Ody-Costello vehicle, the deceleration
was so severe that the valence panel under the front bumper of the test vehicles contacted the road surface during four
of the test stops.) This was repeated three times with each vehicle. After each of the three tests of each vehicle, the
area underhood and under the vehicle was inspected for any evidence of fluid spillage. Each time, the paper toweling
was removed and replaced with fresh toweling prior to the next test.

NHTSA found no evidence of any transmission fluid escaping from any of the dipstick tubes in any of the 12 braking tests
nor any of the ``stop and go'' or highway tests. There were no oil spots on the testing surface, nor any evidence of any
oil on any of the paper towels used around the dipstick tubes.

ODI maintains a library of owner's manuals for all passenger vehicles sold in the United States. Currently, the manuals
cover all model years from 1989 through 1994. These manuals were reviewed and no passenger vehicle was located that
was fitted with any original equipment device or clamp to retain the transmission dipstick into the dipstick tube.
In addition, almost all transmission dipsticks are located near the rear of the engine compartment on the passenger
side. In all cases where the vehicles are equipped with either V&hyph;8 or V&hyph;6 engines, this places the opening
of the dipstick tube above the exhaust manifold and exhaust pipe for the right bank of cylinders. Although a few vehicles
were located with the transmission dipstick tube opening located a few inches higher than the subject Cougars, the
height of the opening of the Cougar dipstick tube is typical.

There has been one safety recall involving a transmission dipstick (recall 

#

93V016). This recall involved 1988 through 1990 full-sized Chevrolet trucks. It was determined that when these vehicles
were towing heavy trailers in overdrive, pressure could build up in the automatic transmission and transmission
fluid would be forced from the transmission dipstick tube. A special dipstick was supplied to owners with a locking
seal. There is no evidence to indicate that pressure build up occurs in the subject Cougar vehicles.

The construction of the Cougar dipstick and the method used to seal the top of the dipstick tube with the dipstick are
also typical of peer vehicles. Dipsticks were examined for several model vehicles manufactured by Chrysler and General
Motors, and the dipsticks and seals were all found to be of the same style and very similar in both construction and design.
The location and the method by which the dipstick is inserted into the transmission tube are also very similar.

The petitioner's primary request (``suggestion'') is that the agency require the manufacturer to install a clamp
to hold the dipstick into the dipstick tube in a more positive manner. This suggestion implies that the petitioner
recognizes that if the dipstick is seated into the dipstick tube according to the manufacturer's recommendations,
no fluid will escape. The petitioner also suggests that NHTSA might want to look into the possibility of raising or
relocating the dipstick tube so that if the dipstick is not properly installed into the dipstick tube, transmission
fluid will be less likely to escape or come in contact with exhaust system components.

Both ODI and the manufacturer have searched their files and the petitioner's reported incident is the only recorded
occurrence that has been located. The petitioner states that the problem originally occurred when a dipstick was
improperly installed by a mechanic in a Ford dealership, after transmission repairs. The dipstick is not in a unique
location, nor does proper insertion of the dipstick appear to be difficult, even for owners that are not mechanically
inclined. It appears that the dipstick was inadvertently left loose, or not fully seated after repairs. In order to
duplicate the original incident, the petitioner has had to leave the dipstick unseated, so that the opening of the
dipstick tube is partially open. The Ford dipstick tube height is typical of peer vehicles. In fact, most vehicles
on the road have their transmission dipsticks in similar locations and also seal the top of the transmission dipstick
tube with a rubber seal located on the dipstick. 

In summary, a review of all the pertinent information leads to the following conclusions:

1. The petitioner's allegation appears to be an isolated incident.

<DOCNO> FR940927-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940927-2-00072 </PARENT>

2. The alleged problem appears to be the result of improper maintenance and repair, rather than a manufacturing defect.


3. The Cougar transmission dipstick, dipstick tube, and sealing system are typical of other peer vehicles.

4. If an owner uses reasonable care and follows the manufacturer's instructions in the vehicle's owner manual, the
seal on the transmission dipstick will prevent spillage or escape of transmission fluid.

5. There is no evidence that the transmission dipstick will not stay in place once properly inserted into the tube.
However, the dipstick could be left loose by an inattentive owner or mechanic, regardless of the presence of a retaining
device.

In consideration of the available information, it is concluded that there is not a reasonable possibility that an
order concerning the notification and remedy of a safety-related defect in relation to the petitioner's allegations
would be issued at the conclusion of an investigation. Further commitment of resources to determine whether a safety-related
defect trend exists does not appear to be warranted. Therefore, the petition is denied.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE






Board of Governors; Notice of Vote to Close Meeting




By telephone vote, a majority of the members contacted and voting, the Board of Governors voted to add to the agenda
of its meeting closed to public observation on October 3, 1994, in Seattle, Washington, consideration of an incentive
compensation plan (See 59 FR 46084, September 6, 1994).

The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(b) of title
39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government
in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information relating to internal personnel
practices. 

The Board further determined that the public interest did not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be
open to the public.

In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to section 552b(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and section
7.3(b) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.

Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary for the Board, David F. Harris, at
(202) 268&hyph;4800.

The General Counsel of the Commission, or his designee, has certified that, in his opinion, one or more of the exemptions

of the scheduled matters at a closed meeting.

Commissioner Roberts, as duty officer, voted to consider the items listed for the closed meeting in a closed session,
and determined that this was the earliest practicable time to provide notice of the open meeting.

The subject matter of the open meeting scheduled for Tuesday, September, 27, 1994, at 2:30 p.m., will be:





1. The Commission will consider whether to amend Rule 10b_10 and adopt Rule 11Acl&hyph;3 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 generally requiring disclosure by broker-dealers of the practice of payment for order flow. In addition,
the Commission will consider whether to delegate the authority to grant exemptions from Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 to the
Director of the Division of Market Regulation. For further information, please contact Jill W. Ostergaard at (202)
942&hyph;0169.

2. The Commission will consider whether to issue a release proposing and soliciting comment on rule 15c5&hyph;1.

at a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order that it is holding, without executing the customer
limit order at such price or a price more favorable to the customer, under the specific terms and conditions by which
the order is accepted by the market maker. There are certain itemized exceptions to the rule as well as specific provisions
governing the type of orders and the class of persons eligible for protection under the rule. For further information,
