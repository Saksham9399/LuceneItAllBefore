 Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request by the petitioners, domestic producers of standard pipe products, the Department of Commerce
(the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded
carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The review period is 
March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to
the United States, Saha Thai Steel Pipe Company, Ltd. (Saha Thai). As a result of the review, we have preliminarily
determined that dumping margins exist with respect to this manufacturer/exporter. 



Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



On March 11, 1986, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (51 FR 8341). On March
12, 1993, the Department published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of certain circular welded
carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (57 FR 13583). On March 30, 1993, the domestic producers (Allied Tube &amp;
Conduit Corporation, Sawhill Tubular Division of Armco, Inc., American Tube Company, Inc., Laclede Steel Company,
Sharon Tube Company, Wheatland Tube Company, and Eagle Pipe Company) requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)
of the Department's regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period March 1, 1992, through February
28, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960).


The Department is now conducting a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act). 


Scope of the Review 



The products covered by this administrative review are shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and
tubes from Thailand. The subject merchandise has an outside diameter of 0.375 inch or more, but not exceeding 16 inches.
These products, which are commonly referred to in the industry as ``standard pipe'' or ``structural tubing,'' are
hereinafter designated as ``pipe and tube.'' The merchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item numbers 7306.30.1000, 7306.30.5025, 7306.30.5032, 7306.30.5040, 7306.30.5055, 7306.30.5085, and
7306.30.5090. The item numbers are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description
remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. 

The review covers shipments made by Saha Thai from Thailand to the United States during the period of review March 1,
1992, through February 28, 1993 (POR). 


United States Price 



In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because
the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. Purchase price was based on the packed
FOB or C&amp;F price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. The review included all of Saha Thai's U.S. sales
that entered the United States during the POR. We made deductions from the unit price, where applicable, for ocean
freight, bank charges, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, and customs clearing expenses (brokerage).
We made an addition to USP for duty drawback. Additionally, we adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice
as outlined in 

Siliconmanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value,

 59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994. 

No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed. 


Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of pipe and tube in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales to the volume of third-country
sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Saha Thai had sufficient home market sales of the subject
merchandise during the POR. Thus, we based FMV on Saha Thai's sales in the home market. 

We did not include home market sales of pipe and tube made to the specifications of the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM pipe) in our FMV calculation because we determined that such sales were outside the ordinary course
of trade. 

See

 19 U.S.C. 1677(15) and 1677b(a)(1). Rather, we included only sales of pipe and tube made to British Standard specifications
(BS pipe). In determining that Saha Thai's sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of
trade, we did not rely on one factor taken in isolation, but rather considered all the circumstances particular to
the sales in question. In reviewing the evidence for this review, we based our decision upon (1) the different standards
and product uses of ASTM pipes and BS pipes; and (2) the comparative volume of sales and number of buyers of ASTM pipes
and BS pipes in the home market during the POR. 

Saha Thai indicated that the ASTM pipes sold in the home market during the POR were produced on the basis of special orders
or special projects in which the entire project was supplied with ASTM standard pipes. In addition, ASTM pipes and
BS pipes cannot be coupled together. Therefore, ASTM pipe cannot be used in most pipe systems in Thailand and cannot
be used to replace most existing pipe systems in Thailand. Finally, sales of ASTM pipe constituted a small volume of
total Saha Thai's sales of pipe and tube in the home market, and the customers purchasing ASTM pipe in the home market
were limited primarily to new, stand-alone government projects. 

Accordingly, we determined that sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, and
therefore did not use these sales in our calculation of FMV.

Based on findings in the 1988&hyph;89 review that home market sales of the subject merchandise were made by Saha Thai
at prices below the cost of production (COP), the Department conducted a cost investigation in this review. In accordance
with section 773(b) of the Act, and 19 CFR 353.51 of the Department's regulations, we examined whether home market
sales were made below cost and in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were
made at prices which permitted recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade.
We calculated Saha Thai's COP as the sum of all reported materials costs, labor expenses, factory overhead, and general
and selling expenses for the three types of pipe and tube that were sold in the home market during the POR (galvanized
plain-end, black plain-end, and galvanized threaded-and-coupled). We compared COP to home market prices net of
discounts, foreign inland freight, and an adjusted business tax, or value-added tax, depending on the time of sale.

For each model where less than 10 percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the COP, we included all sales of that model in the computation of FMV. For each model where 10 percent or more, but less
than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POR were priced below the merchandise's COP, we excluded from the
calculation of FMV those home market sales which were below the merchandise's COP, provided that these below-cost
sales were made over an extended period of time. For each model where 90 percent or more of the home market sales during
the POR were priced below the COP and were made over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that model
from our calculation of FMV and used the constructed value (CV) of those models as described below. 

To determine whether sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months
in which sales below cost occurred for a particular type of pipe and tube to the number of months in which that type was
sold. If the type was sold in fewer than three months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were below-cost
sales of that type in each month sold. If a type was sold in three or more months, we did not disregard below-cost sales
unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the type was sold. 

Since Saha Thai has not submitted any information indicating that any of its sales below cost were at prices which would
have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' as required
by section 773(b)(2) of the Act, we are unable to conclude that the costs of production of such sales have been recovered
within a reasonable period. As a result, we disregarded below-cost sales made over an extended period of time. 

Using the remaining sales, the Department calculated FMV on a monthly weighted-average basis. Home market prices
were based on the price to unrelated purchasers. Where applicable, we made adjustments for transportation discounts,
foreign inland freight, packing expenses, and business tax, or value-added tax, depending on the date of sale. We
also made adjustments to FMV for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, packing, credit
expenses, and warranty expenses. 

We used CV as FMV to compare to those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient home market sales at or above the COP.
Pursuant to section 773(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.50(a) of the Department's regulations, CV consisted of the
sum of materials, overhead, labor, U.S. packing, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each of the
four types of pipe and tube sold in the United States during the POR (black plain-end, galvanized plain-end, galvanized
threaded-and-coupled, and black threaded-and-coupled). Since Saha Thai's actual selling, general, and administrative
expenses (SG&amp;A) and actual profits were greater than the statutory minima for SG&amp;A and profit as provided
in section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Act, we used the SG&amp;A and profit reported by Saha Thai. We adjusted CV for selling,
credit, and packing expenses. 



Preliminary Results 



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be:

Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 
5 days of publication of this notice and any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any
hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Interested
parties may submit case briefs and/or written comments not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in such briefs or comments, may be filed not later
than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish a notice of the final results of this administrative
review, which will include the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such briefs or comments.
The Department shall determine, and the U.S. Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will
issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs Service. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon completion of the final results of this administrative
review for all shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand, entered or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review,
as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for Saha Thai will be that established in the final
results of this review; (2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but
covered in the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or previous reviews, the cash deposit will continue
to be the rate published in the final determination or the last final results for which the manufacturer or exporter
received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original LTFV investigation,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in
the final results of this review, a previous review, or the original investigation; and (4) if neither the exporter
nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others
rate'' from the LTFV investigation. 
On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Floral Trade Council v. United States,

 822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States,

 822 F. Supp. 782 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that, in order to implement these decisions, it
is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended
for correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders
for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. 
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 15.67 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the Department's final determination of sales
at LTFV (51 FR 3384, January 27, 1986). 
There is a countervailing duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (50 FR 32751,
August 15, 1985). In accordance with section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act, entries subject to both antidumping duties
and countervailing duties will not be assessed antidumping duties on the portion of the margin attributable to export
subsidies. Because the amount of countervailing duties to be imposed on entries during the POR has yet to be determined,
we cannot at this time make the appropriate adjustment. However, to ensure that the appropriate adjustment is made,
upon issuing our final results of the administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs not to assess antidumping
duties on the margin attributable to export subsidies for the POR. 
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary of the Department's presumption
that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a computer matching program between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) for
public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between DOE and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are DOE delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by DOE so as to permit DOE to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset
procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

This proposed action will become effective December 22, 1994, and the computer matching will proceed accordingly
without further notice, unless comments are received which would result in a contrary determination or if the Office
of Management and Budget or Congress objects thereto. Any public comment must be received before the effective date.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DMDC and DOE have concluded an
agreement to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal
data between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within
the Federal government so that DOE can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.


A copy of the computer matching agreement between DOE and DMDC is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Department of Energy, Office of Financial Policy, 1000 Independence
Agency, SW, Washington, DC 20585. Telephone (202) 856&hyph;4860.
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 25818 on June 19, 1989.
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on November 9, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A&hyph;130, `Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated July 15, 1994 (59 FR 37906, July 25, 1994). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

Notice of a Computer Matching Program between the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense for Debt Collection




A. 

Participating agencies: 

Participants in this computer matching program are the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Defense Manpower Data Center
(DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD). The DOE is the source agency, i.e., the activity disclosing the records
for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific recipient activity or matching agency, i.e., the agency that
actually performs the computer matching.




B. 

Purpose of the match: 

Upon the execution of an agreement, the DOE will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate
any matched Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under
certain programs administered by the DOD. The DOE will use this information to initiate independent collection of
those debts under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These
collection efforts will include requests by the DOE of any employing Federal agency to apply administrative and/or
salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation is paid in full. 




C. 

Authority for conducting the match: 

The legal authority for conducting the matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365),
31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government), 31 U.S.C.
3711 Collection and Compromise, 31 U.S.C. 3716 Administrative Offset, 5 U.S.C. 5514 Installment Deduction for Indebtedness
(Salary Offset); 10 U.S.C. 136, Assistant Secretaries of Defense, Appointment Powers and Duties; Section 206 of
Executive Order 11222; 4 CFR Chapter II, Federal Claims Collection Standards (General Accounting Office - Department
of Justice); 5 CFR 550.1101 - 550.1108 Collection by Offset from Indebted Government Employees (OPM); 10 CFR part
1015, Collection of Claims Owed the United States (DOE); and 10 CFR part 1018, Referral of Debts to the IRS for Tax Refund
Offset (DOE).





D. 

Records to be matched: 

The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows:

The DOE will use personal data from the record system identified as DOE-19, entitled, `Accounts Receivable Financial
System' last published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 39536 on July 23, 1993. 

DMDC will use personal data from the record systems identified as S322.11 DMDC, entitled `Federal Creditor Agency
Debt Collection Data Base,' last published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 22, 1993, at 58 FR 10875. 

Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act authorize agencies to disclose information about debtors in order to effect
salary or administrative offsets. Agencies must publish routine uses pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy
Act for those systems of records from which they intend to disclose this information. Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection
Act will comprise the necessary authority to meet the Privacy Act's `compatibility' condition. The systems of records
described above contain an appropriate routine use disclosure between the agencies of the information proposed
in the match. The routine use provisions are compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.





E. 

Description of computer matching program: 

The DOE, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a diskette which contains the names of delinquent debtors in programs
the DOE administers. Upon receipt of the diskette file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer match using
all nine digits of the SSN of the DOE file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established under an
interagency agreement between DOD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records
of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the SSN, will
produce the member's name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The hits or matches
will be furnished to the DOE. The DOE is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on the DMDC reply diskette
file are consistent with the DOE source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies on an individual
basis. The DOE will also be responsible for making final determinations as to positive identification, amount of
indebtedness and recovery efforts as a result of the match.
 
The diskette provided by DOE will contain data elements of the debtor's name, Social Security Number, debtor status
and debt balance, internal account numbers and the total amount owed on approximately 64 delinquent debtors.

The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees.

DMDC will match the SSN on the DOE diskette by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN,
will produce data elements of the member's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address.





F. 

Inclusive dates of the matching program: 

This computer matching program is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. If no objections
are raised by either, and the mandatory 30 day public notice period for comment has expired for this 

Federal Register

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between DOE and DMDC, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision for Realignment of Carswell Air Force Base to Naval Air Station Fort Worth, Fort Worth, TX</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations for implementing NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces
its decision to implement realignment of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB) to Naval Air Station (NAS) Fort Worth Joint
Reserve Base (JRB), Fort Worth, Texas. In accordance with the legislative requirements of the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act of 1990 [Public Law (P.L.) 101&hyph;510), the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission
(BRAC&hyph;93) recommended the closure of NAS Dallas, Texas, NAS Memphis, Tennessee, and NAS Glenview, Illinois.
Assets and operations from each of these bases were directed to be relocated to the former Carswell AFB, which closed
September 30, 1993 pursuant to a BRAC&hyph;91 decision. The former Carswell AFB is to be realigned to become the Naval
Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB).
In compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, the Department of the Navy acted as a Cooperating
Agency with the Department of the Air Force and had substantial involvement in drafting and reviewing an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the disposal and reuse of Carswell AFB. The EIS presented a full description of the projects
and environmental impacts associated with the Navy realignment actions. In addition, the Navy planned actions were
presented at the Draft EIS Public Hearing hosted by the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Navy has conducted
an independent review of the EIS and adopts the EIS for purposes of its proposed actions. This Record of Decision announces
Navy's decision to implement actions described in the FEIS for the realignment and operation of NAS Fort Worth JRB,
Fort Worth, Texas.
A Draft EIS was prepared for the proposed reuse and disposal actions and distributed to federal, state, and local agencies
and to interested individuals and groups in February 1993. The DEIS was revised to include the Navy as a cooperating
agency when the BRAC&hyph;93 decision to realign Carswell AFB was made. The revised DEIS was published and distributed
in March 1994. A public hearing was held on April 4, 1994 in the City of Fort Worth, Texas. Responses to all public comments
received were incorporated in an FEIS that was distributed in July 1994. The proposed Navy realignment action would
incorporate approximately 1,869 acres from the former Carswell AFB for reuse as NAS Fort Worth JRB. The realignment
of the base would consist of renovation of approximately 120 buildings and new construction of an additional 25 facilities,
in addition to the demolition of some facilities that are not cost effective to reuse or renovate.
The realignment also includes upgrades of base utilities to accommodate JRB requirements. Upgrades to the airfield
stormwater drainage will also be incorporated into the realignment plans. An estimated total of 24 acres of land will
need to be distributed for new construction activities.
The proposed operations of the NAS Fort Worth JRB will be primarily air operations by reserve forces. Some smaller
non-air units will also be attached to the base. Reserve units from the Navy, Marine corps, Air Force, Texas Air National
Guard, and Army National Guard will be operating at the base. The various types of aircraft that will be normally at
the base will include F&hyph;14s, F/A&hyph;18s, F&hyph;16s, KC&hyph;130s, C&hyph;130s, C&hyph;9s, C&hyph;12s,
U&hyph;21s, CH&hyph;47s, UH&hyph;60s and a UH&hyph;1. An estimated 95,000 annual air operations are associated
with the various proposed military aircraft, including transient military aircraft. All of the existing airspace
and air traffic control services associated with previous Air Force operations will be retained for use by the JRB.
The combination of closure and realignment will reduce military air traffic in the area and significantly reduce
potential civilian-military aircraft conflicts.
Approximately 2,100 active duty military personnel are expected to be attached to the JRB. An additional 1,400 civilian
personnel will be employed at the base. Approximately 8,500 reservists or guardsmen will drill at the JRB on schedules
that will attempt to spread the numbers equally over three weekends each month.
The realignment and establishment of NAS Fort Worth JRB will occur, as mandated by P.L. 101&hyph;510, regardless
of the disposal and reuse of the remaining portions of Carswell AFB. Therefore, these military land areas and reuse
activities were incorporated as part of the No-Action alternative and all reuse alternatives for analysis in the
EIS. Maximum consideration was given to the use of existing structures to minimize environmental impacts and construction
costs for realignment. Sites considered at NAS Fort Worth JRB for the proposed new facilities avoided environmentally
sensitive areas and were selected based on functional considerations, adequacy of existing structures for the proposed
uses, availability of utilities, proximity to existing facilities, and observing all airfield safety and noise
criteria. The proposed action will cause no significant impact to ambient air quality levels. Localized, temporary
impacts would occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with state and federal regulations,
including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during any removal
of asbestos-containing materials.

NAS Fort Worth JRB is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability analysis was performed for air pollutant
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the 1993 General
Conformity Rule for determining conformity of federal actions to state or federal implementation plans (40 CFR Parts
6, 51, and 93). The analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source
emissions associated with the proposed action. Neither NO

X

 nor VOC emissions estimates for any year of the proposed action exceeded the de minimis levels of 100 tons per year established
by the General Conformity Rule. The proposed action was determined to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
and is exempted from any further requirements of the General Conformity Rule. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) has reviewed the applicability analysis presented in the FEIS and has approved the air permit
application resulting in the issuance of a construction permit to the Navy.



An aircraft noise study was conducted to analyze the effects of noise patterns associated with JRB operations as compared
to the previous operations at Carswell AFB. The area exposed to sound level DNL 65 dB or greater is expected to decrease
by approximately 2,605 acres and affect 2,300 fewer residents than the previous Air Force aircraft noise impacts.


No significant degradation of levels of service for on-base or off-base road systems are expected as a result of the
proposed action. Current utilities to the base are of sufficient capacity to provide anticipated services. Utility
lines within the base infrastructure will be upgraded in some locations where additional fire protection, natural
gas, sanitary sewer, or electrical services are required.


The local economy will not encounter any significant impacts from the proposed action. NAS Forth Worth JRB will initially
reuse 83 units of family housing on-base. An estimated 3,939 housing units within the local communities will be vacated
as a result of the closure of Carswell AFB. An estimated 1,196 housing units will be required to accommodate the in-migration
of permanent personnel associated with the JRB. Based on this projected in-migration, 281 new students will enroll
in the area's various school districts; this number is less than the decreases experienced in each of the last three
years as a result of the Carswell AFB closure.

Clean-up on identified installation restoration program (IRP) sites will continue regardless of the reuse or disposal
plans. The Departments of the Navy and Air Force have entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to identify which department
will continue the management of the clean-up program and provide the funding requirements. The two Departments have
agreed to finalize program arrangements by October 1, 1995. In the interim, the Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA)
will continue to administer the program. New construction and renovations requiring excavations will be closely
coordinated with the IRP project manager to avoid any impacts to IRP sites or construction plans and maintain the health
and safety of contractor personnel.




The Navy will institute a hazardous material minimization program at NAS Fort Worth JRB by issuing hazardous materials
in increments for daily consumption to the various departments and users on base. The hazardous waste storage facility
currently permitted under a Part B permit by the State of Texas will continued to be used as a permitted facility for
the storage of generated hazardous wastes.



The AFBCA has identified all underground storage tanks that were in place at Carswell AFB. Navy design teams are evaluating
what tanks are required for continued support to facilities planned for reuse. These tanks will be inspected and certified
for use in accordance with all applicable underground storage tank regulations. The AFBCA is continuing with efforts
to remove all other tanks not planned for reuse.



The proposed action would result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered
by either federal or state agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has concurred in this conclusion. No impacts
to wetlands will be experienced as a result of new construction. Minor impacts to floodplains will be mitigated through
the construction of improved storm water drainage and handling systems. The estimated 24 acres of disturbance from
new construction will have minimal impacts to biological resources because of adjacencies to current airfield/industrial
operations and the already existing built-up conditions.



Potential impacts to cultural resources at NAS Fort Worth JRB have been evaluated in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations are proposed for two buildings (Building 1430 and 4175)
that have been identified as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior renovations to Building
1430 will include the installation of a new roof. Interior renovations will include movement of office walls added
to the facility during earlier Air Force interior renovations. Building 4575 will undergo major interior renovations
to adapt this alert crew facility to a squadron operations building. Exterior renovations will include removal and
demolition of surrounding equipment, addition of some windows, and altering some facility points of ingress/egress.
All proposed modifications to these buildings will be coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) during
project design. The Navy is proposing to the THC, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the acknowledgment, operation,
and maintenance of eligible historic structures on NAS Fort Worth JRB. No significant archaeological, Native American,
or paleontological resources have been identified on NAS Fort Worth JRB that would be adversely affected by the realignment
activities. In the event that archaeological, paleontological, or Native American resources are discovered during
the course of project activities, ground disturbing activities will cease in the immediate area and a qualified archaeologist
will be consulted.



Questions regarding the Navy proposed actions for the realignment of Carswell AFB to NAS Forth Worth JRB addressed
in the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the Reuse and Disposal of Carswell AFB may be directed
to: Commanding Officer, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, P.O. Box 190010, North Charleston,
SC 29419&hyph;9010 (Attn: Mr. Darrell Molzan, Code 203DM), telephone (803) 743&hyph;0796, fax (803) 743&hyph;0993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Purpose and Need for Action


One of the most urgent and difficult technical tasks facing the DOE is to assess the effects of aging on the weapons that
remain in the nation's nuclear stockpile, and to ensure the continuing safety of those weapons. Because the President
has decided not to build any new nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future, but instead to continue to rely upon a smaller
stockpile of existing but aging weapons as a nuclear deterrent, DOE must ensure that the weapons remaining in the stockpile
are safe, secure and reliable. Under the Atomic Energy Act, this mission rests with DOE and essentially requires DOE
to certify that the weapons will not accidentally detonate during storage and handling, that the weapons would thwart
any attempts for unauthorized use, and that they would function as designed in the event of authorized use. 
To fulfill this mission, DOE needs to collect diagnostic information regarding the condition of the weapons which
remain in the enduring stockpile. Some of these weapons are approaching the end of their design life, and DOE is not
certain how they may be affected by the aging process. One important type of information that is currently lacking
concerns the three-dimensional condition of the various internal components of aging weapons. These are often shielded
by thick and dense materials. Multiple view hydrodynamic testing (experiments to look at the flow of adjacent materials
as they are driven by high explosives) and dynamic testing (experiments to study other effects of high explosives),
combined with computer modeling, provide the only means of obtaining this data in the absence of nuclear testing.
The President has endorsed hydrodynamic testing as the preferred means of conducting experiments in support of stockpile
stewardship and maintenance. Hydrodynamic testing has become more important since the United States moratorium
on nuclear testing was extended. A future Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, moreover, would foreclose the acquisition
of additional performance and safety data through nuclear testing. 



Proposed Action



DARHT would be a specialized high energy X-ray machine that would take three-dimensional, sequential and high-resolution
X-ray pictures of the dynamic behavior of dense materials that are being shocked and compressed by high explosives.
DARHT would be used to evaluate the nonnuclear behavior of nuclear weapons components and would provide the nation
with a significantly improved diagnostic capability to evaluate and assess the safety and reliability of the existing
nuclear weapons stockpile. DARHT would consist of an existing support lab, a new firing site, and the necessary infrastructure,
all located at Technical Area 15 at LANL. DARHT would be used to detonate high explosives, and to use very high-speed,
tightly-focused radiographic (X-ray) photography to determine the motions (dynamic experiments) or flow (hydrodynamic
tests) of the explosive-driven materials. Two X-ray machines at right angles to each other (dual-axis lines of sight)
would be powered by two 16 million electron volt (MeV) electron accelerators, each housed in a building about 225 feet
long. By using two machines, DARHT would be able to provide three-dimensional, sequential information on occurrences
within millionths of a second during a test. The accelerators' small beam size would allow DARHT to provide a very high-quality
resolution of the radiographic image. This resolution is necessary to resolve the fine details of the material flowing
in these experiments.

DARHT experiments would variously involve radioactive materials (primarily depleted uranium), beryllium and
other hazardous materials, and other metals. Additionally, experiments involving plutonium contained in steel
vessels may be conducted. DARHT would not test materials that could result in nuclear yield, or a nuclear detonation.
Experiments at DARHT would be expected to result in metal fragments and other airborne debris being deposited up to
750 meters from the open-air explosives testing (standard operating procedures would require the evacuation of
this area before any experiments were conducted). 

In addition to testing the nonnuclear behavior of nuclear weapons components, DARHT would be used to evaluate conventional
weapons systems, explosives-driven materials for non-weapons uses, and high-velocity impact phenomena. The facility
would also be used to support non-proliferation and counter-proliferation efforts, such as experiments intended
to disable a terrorist-designed or proliferant-designed nuclear weapon. Although DARHT could be used to collect
information relevant to the design of new weapons, no new weapons are anticipated to be designed in the foreseeable
future. 

Design of DARHT began in the early 1980's. Memoranda to File, describing the environmental impacts of constructing
and operating DARHT, were completed in 1983 and 1987. DARHT construction began in 1988 with the Radiographic Support
Laboratory, which was completed in 1990. The Radiographic Support Laboratory is currently being used to support
the development of the accelerator equipment that is planned to be used in DARHT. In May 1994, DOE began construction
of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site. Approximately 20 percent of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site construction work (e.g.,
site preparation, foundation pouring) has been completed. Current schedules call for the Hydrodynamic Firing Site
construction to be completed, and the first X-ray machine to be operating, in 1997 at a cost of approximately $86 million,
and the second X-ray machine, if approved, would begin operation in 2000. The total estimated project cost of DARHT
in its final two-axis configuration is $124 million; to date, approximately $44 million has been spent or obligated
on the project. 

In response to public concern, the DOE has decided to prepare this EIS at this time to allow for a full dialogue between
DOE and the State, tribes, other agencies and the general public regarding the environmental impacts of completing
and operating DARHT, and the impacts of other alternatives. The EIS will also assist in ensuring that appropriate
mitigation measures are developed if DARHT is completed and put into operation. Construction and related work on
the facility will continue during the preparation of the EIS. 



Proposed Alternatives



DOE has tentatively identified the following alternatives for analysis in the EIS and seeks public comment on their
adequacy, inclusiveness, and reasonableness: 



(1) Proposed action



Under this alternative, DOE would complete construction and operate the DARHT facility as currently planned. This
alternative would provide a state-of-the-art diagnostic capability for ensuring the safety, security and reliability
of the aging nuclear weapons stockpile. If DARHT becomes operational, operation of the Pulsed High Energy Radiation
Machine Emitting X-Rays (PHERMEX) facility, an existing facility at LANL also located at Technical Area 15, near
the DARHT site, will be phased out. 



(2) No Action (status quo) Alternative



Under this alternative, DARHT would not be completed and DOE would continue to operate the Pulsed High Energy Radiation
Machine Emitting X-Rays and the Flash X-Ray facility at the Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Site 300 located near Livermore, California. The Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays, a single-axis
radiographic facility, was built in the mid-1960's and has been used continuously since that time. It uses a pulsed
power accelerator to power the X-ray machine, and does not have the small beam size (tight focus) planned for DARHT,
thereby precluding the high-resolution images that DARHT would provide. Flash X-Ray, also a single-axis radiographic
facility, was built in 1982 and has been used continuously since that time. It uses a linear induction accelerator
to power the X-ray machine and also does not have the small beam size planned for DARHT. 



(3) Containment Alternative



Under this alternative, DOE would modify the construction and/or operation of DARHT to contain some or all airborne
emissions of fragments or other debris. Under one approach, the X-ray pictures would be taken through the walls of
a containment vessel. Another approach would be to construct a building to enclose and contain the explosive experiments;
X-ray pictures would be taken within the containment building. These two approaches may be considered separately
or together, for some tests or for all tests.

<TEXT>
 

(4) Institutional Control Alternative


Under this alternative, DOE would complete and operate DARHT, but would limit use of the facility to exclude any applications
involving experiments with plutonium. 


(5) Single-Axis Alternative


Under this alternative DOE would complete construction of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site but would operate only a single
axis of DARHT with one accelerator. This alternative would provide an improved technical capability over present
accelerators with a single view (i.e., the Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays and Flash X-Ray).



(6) Upgrade Alternative


Under this alternative DOE would upgrade the present Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays capability
with the new technology developed for DARHT. 
DOE does not intend, in this EIS, to analyze alternatives or issues beyond the construction and operation of DARHT
that relate to the nation's nuclear weapons policies, the DOE mission of stockpile stewardship and management, the
need for hydrodynamic testing or dynamic testing that are part of the stockpile stewardship and management program,
the mission of LANL, or continued operation of other facilities at LANL. To the extent that these matters are under
the purview of DOE, they will be considered in the Programmatic EIS on Stockpile Stewardship and Management or the
LANL Sitewide EIS, as discussed below in the section on related NEPA reviews. 



Proposed Issues


The EIS will identify and analyze the direct, indirect and cumulative effects resulting from the completion and operation
of DARHT. DOE has tentatively identified the following environmental and socioeconomic issues for consideration
in the EIS and seeks public comment on the adequacy and inclusiveness of these issues: 
&bull;Natural ecosystems, including air quality, surface and groundwater quality, and plants and animals. 

&bull;Cultural resources, including archeological sites, historic resources, other facilities and infrastructure
at LANL, and actual and potential uses of the site including Native American cultural, traditional and religious
uses; DOE has previously identified Native American archeological sites in the vicinity of DARHT and has conducted
mitigating activities. 
&bull;Economic impacts, including those from constructing, equipping and operating DARHT. 
&bull;Socioeconomic impacts, including any disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and low income
populations. 
&bull;Health and safety impacts to on-site workers, other LANL personnel, local communities and tribes, and the
general population of northern New Mexico. 
&bull;Other construction and operational impacts, such as transportation of people and materials. 
&bull;Waste management considerations, including the eventual decontamination and decommissioning of the facility
after the end of its useful life (approximately 30 years). 
&bull;Health and safety, environmental, and other impacts related to the transport, storage and use of hazardous
and radioactive materials and generation of X-ray radiation. 
&bull;Other relevant issues identified by DOE or the State, tribes, other agencies, or the public through this scoping
process. 


Related NEPA Reviews


The Department is currently preparing to undertake two related NEPA reviews. The planned LANL Sitewide EIS (59 FR
40889, August 10, 1994) will consider the cumulative impacts of operations and planned activities foreseen within
the next 5 to 10 years. The planned Stockpile Stewardship and Management Programmatic EIS (59 FR 54175, October 28,
1994) will evaluate activities required to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance
of nuclear weapons in the absence of nuclear testing, and to be prepared to test weapons if so directed by the President.


Classified Material


The Department will review classified material while preparing this EIS. Within the limits of classification, DOE
will provide to the public as much information as possible. If DOE needs to generate classified material to explain
the purpose and need, use, materials, or impacts from this project, that material will be segregated into a classified
appendix.

Public Involvement Opportunities


DOE will develop a stakeholder involvement plan to guide the public review aspects of this EIS. To assist with developing
the stakeholder involvement plan, DOE requests suggestions by the public on how this EIS process should be conducted,
including suggestions regarding the type, format and conduct of public involvement opportunities. 
Through this Notice, DOE formally invites the State, tribes, other government agencies and the public to comment
on the scope of the EIS. DOE will offer informational briefings to tribal governments, local (county and municipal)
governments, and the State of New Mexico. 
A second formal opportunity for comment will be provided after DOE issues the draft EIS, expected in mid-1995. Public
hearings will be held in conjunction with that comment period. DOE will inform the State, tribes, local governments,
other agencies and the general public of its final decisions at the time the Record of Decision is issued, expected
in October 1995. 
In addition to formal opportunities for comment, any person may submit comments at any time during the NEPA review
process; however, to ensure that comments are considered at specific points in the NEPA review, and to best assist
DOE, the public is encouraged to comment during the formally established comment periods. 
Copies of DARHT design and other background documents, written comments, records of public meetings, and other materials
related to the development and analyses of the EIS have been and are being placed in the Los Alamos National Laboratory
Community Reading Room, 1450 Central Avenue, Suite 101, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87544. For information on the availability
of specific documents and hours of operation, please contact the reading room at (505)665&hyph;2127 or (800)543&hyph;2342.

Equitrans, Inc., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings


November 15, 1994.


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Equitrans, Inc.


[Docket No. CP95&hyph;55&hyph;000]


Take notice that on November 3, 1994, Equitrans, Inc. (Equitrans), 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 152752,
filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;55&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP86&hyph;676&hyph;000
to construct and operate certain facilities, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.
Equitrans proposes to install one delivery point tap on Line F&hyph;1153 in Doddrige County, West Virginia. Equitrans
states that the tap would be used to permit Equitable Gas Company (Equitable) to provide service to a residential customer.
Equitrans estimates the quantity of gas delivered through the tap would be 1 Mcf on a peak day. Equitrans asserts that
it would charge Equitable the applicable rate contained in Equitrans' tariff on file with the Commission.

2. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation


[Docket No. CP95&hyph;61&hyph;000]


Take notice that on November 4, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed an abbreviated application
in Docket No. CP95&hyph;61&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's regulations for permission and approval for a flexible, blanket type authorization for
temporary deactivation of storage facilities and operations as well as minor construction at its storage fields
in the Majorsville-Heard Storage Complex. Columbia requests that any authorization granted be ongoing, and notes
that the coal mining activities affecting its storage operations and necessitating this application will continue
for at least the next 13 years. Columbia's proposal is more fully described in its application which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Columbia states that authorization is necessary in order for it to have the flexibility to respond appropriately
to active long wall coal mining in the Majorsville-Heard Storage Complex by Consol Pennsylvania Coal Company and/or
its affiliates (Coal Companies). Columbia says it must fulfill the requirements of the Agreements negotiated between
itself and the Coal Companies which state their respective rights, duties, and obligations and liabilities relating
to the temporary deactivation of the Storage Complex to accommodate mining operations.
Columbia is filing an application for expansion of its Crawford Storage Field, contemporaneously with the instant
application, to offset lost capabilities at the Storage Complex.

<DOCTITLE>ANR Pipeline Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


November 14, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. ANR Pipeline Company 


[Docket No. CP93&hyph;564&hyph;002] 


Take notice that on November 9, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243,
filed an amendment pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to its July 19, 1993 application, as amended February
18, 1994, for authorization to construct and operate pipeline and related facilities at the United States-Canada
International Boundary proximate to St. Clair, Michigan, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
ANR states that its project has been restructured. First, ANR states that two shippers, Michigan Consolidated Gas
Company (MichCon) and The Consumers' Gas Company Limited (Consumers Gas), will now transport up to 75,000 Mcf per
day. (Consumers Gas was the only shipper in the original application with a maximum transportation volume of 66,000
Mcf per day.) Second, Consumers Gas now intends to construct and operate the facilities in Canada necessary to transport
gas delivered by ANR. Third, ANR has eliminated the ANR/Great Lakes Gas Transmission custody transfer measurement
facilities proposed in the original application, included the cost of the ANR/MichCon Columbus Meter Station, and
has reflected new pipe material specifications and 1995 cost adjustments in its cost of facilities. This results
in an estimated cost of facilities of $15,298,000. 


Comment date: 

December 5, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

3. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation 


[Docket No. CP95&hyph;62&hyph;000]



Take notice that on November 4, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed an abbreviated application
in Docket No. CP95&hyph;62&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's
regulations, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation
of certain natural gas storage facilities at its existing Crawford Storage Field. Columbia seeks authorization
to increase annual turnover by approximately 8.2 Bcf with an associated increase in design day deliverability of
approximately 67 MMcfd. Columbia proposes to increase storage capacity of its Crawford Storage Field to offset the
temporary deactivation of storage operations at Columbia's Majorsville Storage Complex located on the West Virginia
and Pennsylvania border. Columbia's proposal is more fully described in its application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection. 
Specifically, Columbia seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: (a) Increased operations
at the Crawford Storage Field located in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio with a maximum storage capacity of 52
Bcf excluding 9 Bcf of native gas with 17.65 Bcf of annual turnover and 232.2 MMcfd of design day deliverability; 
(b) the construction and operation of four additional storage wells; and 
(c) the construction and operation of 5.01 miles of replacement and new pipelines and appurtenances if the Crawford
Storage Field and at the Crawford Compressor Station in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio. 
Columbia states that the increase in Crawford's storage capabilities is necessary due to the allocation of all Columbia's
storage capacity to its customers as part of the implementation of Order No. 636. If Columbia does not replace the lost
storage capability at Majorsville Storage Complex with an equivalent capability at Crawford, then it will have less
storage to meet its long-term Firm Storage Service (FSS) commitments than was approved by the Commission in Columbia's
Order No. 636 proceeding.

<DOCTITLE>Columbia Gulf Transmission Co.; Withdrawal of Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



November 16, 1994.



Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf) tendered a filing requesting
to withdraw certain tariff sheets.

On October 31, 1994, Columbia Gulf tendered a revised filing in RP94&hyph;219&hyph;003, et al. which, among other
things, motioned certain tariff sheets into effect that were originally filed on April 29, 1994 (motion rate filing).

It has come to Columbia Gulf's attention that the motion rate filing moved into effect tariff sheets in certain X-Rate
Schedules, contained in Volume No. 2 of Columbia Gulf's tariff, that it has filed to cancel due to abandonment authorized
in other dockets. Some of the tariff sheets cancelling the relevant X-Rate Schedules have been accepted by the Commission
and others are pending before the commission. In addition, the tariff sheet for Rate Schedule X&hyph;35 should not
have been part of the April 29th filing since its cancellation was approved March 21, 1991, to be effective November
28, 1990.

Therefore, Columbia Gulf requests to withdraw the Volume No. 2 tariff sheets listed below, which were motioned into
effect in the October 31, 1994 filing:




Fourth Revised Sheet No. 71

Second Revised Sheet No. 91

Second Revised Sheet No. 317

Second Revised Sheet No. 384

Second Revised Sheet No. 565

Second Revised Sheet No. 593

Second Revised Sheet No. 817




Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the
proceeding. Copies of Columbia Gulf's filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Tariff Filing</DOCTITLE>


November 16, 1994.


Take notice that on November 14, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet:


Substitute Eighth Revised Sheet No. 8A


FGT states that on May 2, 1994, FGT filed in Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;34&hyph;000 (May 2 Filing) to suspend its
Annual Unit Take-or-Pay Surcharge (TOP Surcharge) effective June 1, 1994. This filing was subject to a supplemental
filing to be made by FGT to reflect actual balances pertaining to its collection of the take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down
costs (Southern Fixed Charges) billed by Southern Natural Gas Company (``Southern'') and to make any related tariff
changes required. On May 18, 1994, the Commission issued an order (May 18 Order) accepting FGT's May 2 filing subject
to the supplemental filing by FGT. 
On September 12, 1994, FGT made the supplemental filing (September 12 Filing) in compliance with the Commission's
May 18 Order which detailed the Southern Fixed Charge account balances by customer, proposed certain changes to Section
25 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions (GTC), and reinstated the TOP Surcharge to recover the outstanding Southern
Fixed Charge account balances owed FGT by certain customers. Several parties protested FGT's September 12 filing
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (protesting parties). On October 3, 1994, FGT filed an answer (October 3 Answer) to the protests in order to clarify
certain misunderstandings and misrepresentations contained in the protests. 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Florida Power &amp; Light Company; Florida Power Corporation; Florida Cities; Industrial Gas Users of Florida (IGF);
and filing collectively Coronet Industries, Inc., Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rinker Materials Corporation,
and the U.S. Agrichemicals Corporation. 
</FOOTNOTE>


On October 28, 1994, the Commission issued its Order Accepting and Suspending Tariff Sheets Subject to Refund and
Conditions, and Granting Waiver (October 28 Order). The October 28 Order accepted the tariff sheets submitted wit
FGT's September 12 Filing, subject to refund, and directed FGT to provide additional information and documentation
regarding the determination of the remaining charges in response to the protesting parties' concerns. FGT is filing
concurrently herewith the information in compliance with the October 28 Order. 
FGT states that in compiling the detailed information provided in the compliance filing FGT discovered certain minor
errors which affected the recoveries from two customers, Consolidated Minerals (Consolidated) and Orlando Utilities
Commission (OUC). Because recoveries affect the memorandum account balances and carrying charge calculations
which affect the flowthrough cap calculations, FGT has recalculated all of the schedules submitted with the September
12 Filing. Because of the impact of the adjustments to the recoveries from Consolidated and OUC, the unit surcharge
rate proposed to become effective December 1, 1994 changed from 12.73

&cent;

 per MMBtu to 12.72

&cent;

 per MMBtu.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.; Issuance of Order</DOCTITLE>


November 16, 1994.



On June 21, 1994, as supplemented on September 9, 1994, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. (MS Capital) filed an application
requesting Commission approval to sell electricity at market-based rates. MS Capital is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (Morgan Stanley), a large, international investment banking company.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In its application, MS Capital sought waiver of certain of the Commission's regulations. In particular, MS Capital
requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR Part 34 of all future issuances of securities and
assumptions of liabilities by MS Capital. On November 8, 1994, the Commission issued an Order Accepting Market-Based
Rate Schedule For Filing, Granting And Denying Requests For Waivers And Authorizations, And Addressing Marketers'
Annual Charge Obligations (order), in the above-docketed proceeding.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Morgan Stanley operates in seven business lines (investment banking, equity products, fixed income products, merchant
banking, asset management, foreign exchange trading, and commodities activities), many of which involve dealings
with public utilities. Morgan Stanley acts as a securities underwriter, sometimes for utility securities, and as
a market-maker in stocks and bonds, including utility stocks and bonds. Morgan Stanley also acts as an investment
banker, advising utility clients on financial and capital matters. Morgan Stanley also holds securities of utilities
for the accounts of its clients. Various subsidiaries provide merchant banking functions and own interests in electric
power generation facilities such as qualifying facilities (OFs).


</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission's November 8, 1994 Order granted the request for blanket approval under 18 CFR Part 34, subject to the
following conditions found in Ordering Paragraphs (C), (D), and (F):

(C) Within 30 days of the date of this order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the Commission's blanket approval
of issuances of securities or assumptions of liabilities by MS Capital should file a motion to intervene or protest
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance
with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214 (1994).

(D) Absent a request to be heard within the period set forth in Ordering Paragraph (C) above, MS Capital is hereby authorized,
pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Power Act, to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as guarantor,
endorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issue or assumption
is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of MS Capital, compatible with the public interest, and reasonably
necessary or appropriate for such purposes.

(F) The Commission reserves the right to modify this order and to require a further showing that neither public or private
interests will be adversely affected by continued Commission approval of MS Capital's issuances of securities or

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The settling parties are Donivan and Ora Lee Ratliff (the Ratliffs) and Don and Connie Fultz (the Fultzs), former operators
of the Renner Road Shooting Range, also known as Schroeder's Gun Club, which is the subject Superfund Site (the Site).






The Renner Road Shooting Range is located in Shawnee, Kansas in the north-central portion of Johnson County, approximately
12 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. This Site is located in an area experiencing dramatic growth and development
and the tract is expected to be developed for residential use. The 58 acre parcel was used as a gun club from the mid 1950's
to 1976.


The firing of shot guns resulted in lead contamination at the Site. EPA Region VII issued an Action Memorandum on March
18, 1993 for conduct of a time-critical removal action. EPA Region VII began on-site removal activities in the Spring
of 1994. The removal is complete. We excavated approximately 3,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil, solidified
it and transported it off-site to an approved disposal facility. Clean up costs are approximately $1 million.



Region VII issued administrative orders on consent to the Fultzs and the Ratliffs for settlement of their responsibility
through a 

de minimis

 waste contributor settlement. These settlements have been approved by the Department of Justice as required under
section 122(g) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g) because the response costs in this matter exceed $500,000. The terms of
these settlements require the Fultzs to pay $11,250 and the Ratliffs to pay $30,000. EPA determined these amounts
to be fair shares of liability based on the amount of hazardous substances contributed by each of the settling parties.
These settlements include contribution protection from lawsuits by other potentially responsible parties as provided
for under section 122(g)(5) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(5).



The 

de minimis

 settlements provide that EPA covenants not to sue the Ratliffs or the Fultzs for response costs at the Site or for injunctive
relief pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA and section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1980, as amended (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6973. The settlements contain a reopener clause which nullifies the covenant not
to sue if the parties fail to make the required payments or if any information becomes known to EPA that indicates that
the parties: (1) Conducted or permitted the generation, transportation, storage, treatment or disposal of any hazardous
substance at the Site after the effective date of the order; or (2) that the parties no longer meet the criteria for a


de minimis

 settlement set forth in section 122(g)(1)(A) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(1)(A).



The

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 18, 1994, the Authority granted, in part, an application for review of the Acting Regional Director's
Decision and Order in 

Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, California and National Association of Government
Employees, Local R12&hyph;28, 

No. SF&hyph;CU&hyph;40012, and consolidated cases. A copy of the decision may be obtained in the Authority's Case
Control Office at the aforementioned address; a copy will be forwarded (by mail or facsimile) to any interested person
who so requests by contacting Alicia Columna at the same address. A brief summary of the case follows.



The union filed clarification of unit (CU) petitions requesting that certain recognized bargaining units be clarified
to include employees who it claimed has accreted to the units as a result of a reorganization which (1) disestablished
the employing entity in which the units were originally recognized (the previous entity) and (2) created a new entity
(the current employing activity) encompassing the previous one as well as others in which no labor organizations
held exclusive recognition. The union claimed that the new entity was the successor employer to the one in which recognition
previously was granted. The current employing activity filed representative status (RA) petitions challenging
the continued appropriateness of the units for which clarification was sought.

Applying the factors for determining successorship set forth in 

Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration, 

3 FLRA 77 (1980) (

DOE

), the Acting Regional Director (ARD) dismissed the CU petitions and directed that representation elections be conducted.
These factors are: (1) The existing unit must be transferred substantially intact to the gaining employer; (2) the
appropriateness of the unit must remain unimpaired in the gaining employer; and (3) a question concerning representation
(QCR) may not be timely raised as to the representative status of the incumbent union. In the ARD's view, the second


DOE 

factor was not met because the reorganization had substantially changed the character and scope of the former units
so that the appropriateness of the units was impaired, and the third 

DOE 

factor was not met because the RA petitions filed by current employing activity raised a QCR.

The Authority granted review, under &sect;2422.17(c) of the Authority's Regulations, 5 CFR 2422.27(c), of the ARD's
conclusions regarding both the second and third 

DOE

 factors. With regard to the second factor, the Authority found it unclear from precedent whether and/or how accretion
principles are or should be applied to determine whether the appropriateness of bargaining units remains unimpaired
as a result of a reorganization. The Authority questioned whether the continued appropriateness of a unit must be
established before a finding is made as to whether other employees have accreted into it, or whether these determinations
should be made in another way or sequence. With regard to the third 

DOE

 factor, the Authority found an absence of precedent on the issue of whether the filing of an RA petition raises a QCR
so as to preclude a finding of successorship.

The Authority directed the parties to file briefs addressing the following questions:

1. In considering the second factor for determining successorship set forth in 

DOE

, what criteria should be applied to determine whether appropriateness of a bargaining unit remains unimpaired as
a result of a reorganization when accretion is claimed? How do those criteria apply in this case?

2. In considering the third factor for determining successorship set forth in 

DOE

, does the filing of an RA petition questioning the continued appropriateness of an existing bargaining unit raise
a QCR so as to preclude a finding that a successor relationship exists between an established bargaining unit and the
gaining agency?

3. Should the factors for determining successorship set forth in 

DOE

 be modified or clarified in any other respect?

As these matters are likely to be of concern to agencies, labor organizations, and other interested persons, the Authority
finds it appropriate to provide for the filing of amicus briefs addressing any or all of the aforementioned issues.




Dated: November 17, 1994.




For the Authority.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of program exclusions.





During the month of October 1994, the 
HHS Office of Inspector General imposed 
exclusions in the cases set forth below. 
When an exclusion is imposed, no program 
payment is made to anyone for any items or 
services (other than an emergency item or 
service not provided in a hospital emergency 
room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an 
excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, 
Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant and Block Grants to States for Social 
Services programs. In addition, no program 
payment is made to any business or facility, 
e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for 
payment for items or services provided by an 
excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain 
free to decide for themselves whether they 
will continue to use the services of an 
excluded party even though no program 
payments will be made for items and services 
provided by that excluded party. The exclusions 
have national effect and also apply to all other 
Federal non-procurement programs.

A. General 



The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;503), amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.
552a) by adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. Section 7201 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), further amended the Privacy Act regarding
protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching by Federal
agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, or local government records. It
requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 

(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs; 

(2) Obtain the Data Integrity Boards' approval of the match agreements. 

(3) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget; 

(4) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and 

(5) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments.




B. SSA Computer Matches Subject to the Privacy Act 



We have taken action to ensure that all of SSA's computer matching programs comply with the requirements of the Privacy
Act, as amended.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Kerr Hydroelectric Project (``Project'') is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation, and in Flathead and
Lake Counties, in northwestern Montana. The Kerr Dam and portions of the project works, including approximately
one half of the Project's reservoir, are located within the exterior boundary of the Flathead Indian Reservation.
The north half of the Project's reservoir is located in Flathead and Lake Counties. At the north shore of Flathead Lake,
a portion of the Project is located within the Flathead Waterfowl Production Area, which is owned and administered
by the Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.


On July 17, 1985, as the result of a negotiated settlement, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission'')
issued a new 50-year operating license for the Kerr Project, jointly to the Montana Power Company and the Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes as co-licensees. 

The Montana Power Company, 

32 FERC &para;61,070 (1985). The specific terms of the license provide, 

inter alia, 

that



[T]he Secretary [of the Interior] shall be allowed *&blank;*&blank;* to impose such reasonable license conditions
with respect to fish [and wildlife] and related environmental concerns as the Secretary would be empowered under
Section 4(e) [of the Federal Power Act] to require *&blank;*&blank;*.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) authorizes the Commission to issue licenses for hydroelectric projects
``upon any part of the public lands and reservations of the United States.'' FPA Section 4(e), 16 U.S.C. 797(e) (1988
&amp; Supp. 1992). Such licenses ``shall be subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary of the department
under whose supervision such reservation falls 

shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation

.'' 

Id. 

(emphasis added). The mandatory language of Section 4(e) requires the Commission to accept, without modification,
Secretarial conditions reasonably related to the protection and adequate utilization of the reservation and its
purposes, and which are supported by substantial evidence. 

See Escondido Mutual Water Co. 

v. 

La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 

466 U.S. 765, 777, n. 18, 778 (1983).



</FOOTNOTE>

Articles 45(b) and 46(c).


The Kerr Project license requires that the Secretary provide for ``notice and opportunity for hearing'' in the formulation
of the &sect;4(e) conditions for the Kerr Project. 

Id. 

Consistent with the terms of the Kerr Project license, the Secretary is providing interested parties with notice
and an opportunity to comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions.
The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base load operational
scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating or peak power
generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping rates), and
a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures designed
to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with operational
measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation Strategy,
development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation
and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural
resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition
of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat
acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees.
The proposed conditions are available for review at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington,
DC in room 6443. Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions are being sent to all individuals, agencies and organizations
on the Commission's service list for the Kerr Project, and to those who have otherwise requested to be included on the
Secretary's Kerr Project Section 4(e) mailing list. The document will be mailed to all interested parties requesting
copies. The Secretary's final conditions will be informed by evidence and comments submitted within 30 days of the
date of publication of this notice.

ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Coos
Bay District, Coos Bay, Oregon.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, section 202(f) of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and 43 CFR part 1610, a Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental
Impact Statement (PRMP/FEIS) has been prepared for the Coos Bay District, Oregon. The PRMP/FEIS describes and analyzes
future options for managing approximately 329,700 acres of mostly forested public land and 12,150 acres of non-federal
surface ownership with federal mineral estate administered by the Bureau of Land Management in Coos, Curry, Douglas,
and Lane counties in southwestern Oregon.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 There will be a 30-day comment/protest period beginning when the Environmental Protection Agency publishes its
Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

, anticipated to be November 18, 1994. Anyone can comment on the PRMP/FEIS but only those persons or organizations
who participated in the planning process leading to this PRMP/FEIS may protest. Protests must be postmarked within
the 30-day comment/protest period.



A protesting party may raise only those issues which were submitted for the record during the planing process. Protests
of proposed plan elements that merely adopt decisions made in the Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service
and Bureau of Land Management Planning documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (SEIS ROD) will be dismissed
as the Director has no authority to overrule those decisions. Details of the protest process can be found in the PRMP/FEIS.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Copies of the PRMP/FEIS and a summary of it may be obtained from the Coos Bay District Office. Copies will be available
for public reading and review at the public libraries in Brookings, Gold Beach, Bandon, Myrtle Point, Coquille, Coos
Bay, North Bend, Reedsport, and Powers, all government document depository libraries, and at the following BLM locations:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public participation has occurred throughout the RMP process. A Notice of Intent was filed in the 

Federal Register

 on August 28,1986 (Volume 51, number 167, page 30718). Since that time, numerous public meetings, mailings, and briefings
were conducted to solicit comments and ideas. The Draft RMP/EIS was available for public review and comment from August
21, 1992 to December 21, 1992. Written comments were received from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Oral
comments were also received at public meetings held in North Bend, Reedsport, and Gold Beach Oregon. All comments
presented throughout the process have been considered in preparation of the PRMP/FEIS.



The PRMP/FEIS describes and analyzes seven alternatives to resolve the following issues: (1) Timber production
practices; (2) Old-growth forests and habitat diversity; (3) Threatened and Endangered and other special status
species habitat (including habitat for the northern spotted owl); (4) Special areas; (5) Visual resources; (6) Stream/riparian/water
quality; (7) Recreation resources; (8) Wild and scenic rivers; (9) Land tenure; and (10) Rural interface areas. The
issues are analyzed in seven distinct alternatives, with each alternative representing a complete management plan
for the district.

The Proposed Resource Management Plan responds to the need for a healthy forest ecosystem with habitat that will support
populations of native species (particularly those associated with late-successional and old-growth forests).
It also responds to the need for a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products that will help maintain the
stability of local and regional economies, and contribute valuable resources to the national economy, on a predictable
and long-term basis. BLM-administered lands are primarily allocated to Riparian Reserves, Late-Successional
Reserves, General Forest Management Areas, and Connectivity/Diversity Blocks. An Aquatic Conservation Strategy
would be applied to all lands and waters under BLM jurisdiction. 

Approximately 61,900 acres would be managed for timber production. The annual probable sale quantity would be 5.3
million cubic feet (32.1 million board feet). To contribute to biological diversity, standing trees, snags, and
down, dead woody material would be retained.

Management would provide for a wide variety of recreation opportunities, with particular emphasis on enhancement
of opportunities for dispersed recreational use.

Approximately 184 miles of river found eligible for designation and studied by BLM would be found not suitable for
designation.

Most BLM-administered lands would remain available for mineral leasing and location of mining claims, but 1,600
acres would be closed to leasing for oil and gas and geothermal resources, and 12,500 acres would be closed to location
of claims.

The PRMP/FEIS proposes continuation of designation of one Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), one Research
Natural Area (RNA), and designation of nine new ACECs. The Proposed RMP would designate or redesignate the following
ACECs and RNA with the noted restrictions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The DEIS/DEIR considers the effects of renewing the Cachuma Project Contract under which water service has been provided
to the member units. The existing Cachuma Project Contract (No. I75r-1802) was executed on September 12, 1949, for
irrigation, and municipal and industrial purposes under the provisions of section 9(c)(2) and 9(e) of the 1939 Reclamation
Project Act. The authority for contract renewal is pursuant to the Act of July 2, 1956, 70 Stat. 483, and the Act of June
21, 1963, 77 Stat. 68, requiring the Secretary of the Interior, upon request, to renew long-term contracts.


The Cachuma Project has been the principal water supply for the majority of the member units since initial deliveries
began in 1955. These member units include the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta Water District, Montecito Water District,
Summerland Water District, Carpinteria County Water District, and the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District,
Improvement District No. 1. The original Cachuma Project Contract has a term of 40 years, and will expire on May 14,
1995. 
A preferred alternative has not yet been identified for the DEIS/DEIR. Several alternatives, including the ``no
action'' alternative, are evaluated in the DEIS/DEIR, and also describe the existing environment and environmental
consequences of contract renewal. They consider the following issues: environmental improvement and restoration
with respect to biological resources, including fisheries, wildlife, and riparian vegetation, surface water hydrology,
ground-water hydrology, flood control, water supply and demand, water pricing and delivery practices, increased
operational efficiency, increased conservation, conjunctive use, water exchanges and transfers, recreational
enhancement and land use policies, agriculture, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, and Indian Trust
Assets. Mitigation of impacts, where necessary, is also identified in the document. 
The Santa Ynez Indian Reservation (Reservation), the Southern California Area Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), and the Sacramento Area Office of the BIA have been contacted by Reclamation regarding Indian Trust Assets
(ITAs) that may be affected by the proposed action. No potentially affected ITAs have been identified by the BIA. Under
certain alternatives, reduced ground-water levels in the Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin could affect streamflow
in the Zanja de Cota Creek, to which the Reservation Indians have certain water diversion rights. 


Hearing Process Information 


Those wishing to request in advance a time to make comments prior to the hearing dates should write or call the Cachuma
Project Authority, Santa Barbara, California. Requests should indicate at which session the speaker wishes to appear.
Speakers will be called upon to present their comments in the order in which their requests were received by the Cachuma
Project Authority. Requests to speak may also be made at each session and will be called after the advance requests.
Oral comments will be limited to 10 minutes per individual. 
Written comments, for inclusion in the hearing record, from those unable to attend the hearing or wishing to supplement
their oral presentation should be received at the Cachuma Project Authority by January 12, 1995. 





Note: 

If special assistance is required, contact Chris Dahlstrom at (805) 569&hyph;1391. Please notify Mr. Dahlstrom
as far in advance of the hearings as possible and not later than January 3, 1995, to enable Cachuma Project Authority
to secure the needed services. If a request cannot be honored, the requester will be notified. A telephone device for
the hearing impaired (TDD) is available at (209) 487&hyph;5933.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. AB&hyph;290 (Sub-No. 161X)]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>Norfolk and Western Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_McDowell County, WV</DOCTITLE>



Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) has filed a verified notice under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments

 to abandon a 1.0-mile rail line between mileposts BZ&hyph;0.0 and BZ&hyph;1.0 at Buzzards Creek Junction, in McDowell
County, WV.

NW has certified that:

(1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years;

(2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted over other lines;

(3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on
behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any
U.S. District Court or has been decided in complainant's favor within the last 2 years; and

(4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 and
1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies), and 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) have been met.

As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under 

Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen,

 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether employees are adequately protected, a petition for partial revocation under
49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed.

This exemption will be effective December 22, 1994 unless stayed or a statement of intent to file an offer of financial
assistance (OFA) is filed. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues,

1

 statements of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

2

 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29

3

 must be filed by December 2, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must

Commission in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the exemption's effective date. 

See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines,

 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any request for a stay should be filed as soon as possible so that the Commission may take appropriate
action before the exemption's effective date.

The Commission will accept late-filed trail use requests so long as the abandonment has not been consummated and the
abandoning railroad is willing to negotiate an agreement.

</FOOTNOTE>


If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void 

ab initio.



NW has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic
resources. The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA)
by November 25, 1994. A copy of the EA may be obtained by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;237]</RINDOCK>



<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Co. (Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2)</DOCTITLE>


Exemption


I


Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;19,
which authorizes operation of the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2 (the facility), at a steady-state power level
not in excess of 2527 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Grundy
County, Illinois. This license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations,
and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.


II


By letter dated October 28, 1994, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), ComEd requested a schedular exemption for Dresden,
Unit 2, from the 18-month test interval for a Type A Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT) as required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, Section III.A.6.(b). The exemption is requested to avoid a potential reactor shut down to perform the Type A test.
Due to two forced outages, ComEd has had to reschedule the Dresden, Unit 2, refueling outage from September 1994 to
July 1995. Subsequently, ComEd requested a maximum extension of up to an additional 242 days for the 18-month Appendix
J test interval for a Type A test. The Type A test can not be performed during power operation.


III


In its letter dated October 28, 1994, ComEd requested a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirement
of Appendix J. ComEd has provided leakage test results and maintenance information for the past two outage testing
programs. The two consecutive Type A ILRT failures that placed Dresden, Unit 2, on the accelerated test schedule were
because of the addition of the Type B and C test leakage results to the Type A leakage rate_not problems with the Type
A boundaries. The minimum pathway data from the last two Unit 2 refueling outages (D2R12 and D2R13) indicate that,
on a minimum pathway basis, the quality of primary containment does not degrade excessively through the course of
the fuel cycle. The total containment leakage rate minus the Type B and C leakages for the last two Type A test failures
during D2R12 and D2R13 are 285.5 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) and 302.62 scfh, respectively. These values are
47 percent and 50 percent of the Type A ILRT acceptance criteria of 610.56 scfh (0.75L

a

). The acceptance criteria are from the Dresden, Unit 2, Technical Specification (TS) Section 3.7.A.2.b.(1). During
the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A ILRT failed due to a leak of the inboard flange of the reactor building to suppression
chamber vacuum breaker valve (2&hyph;1601&hyph;20A). This leakage was quantified to be 12720.05 scfh. If this did
not occur, the Type A ILRT results would have been 543.40 scfh, which is less than the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L

a

). During the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A test failed due to the as-found minimum pathway leakage of primary
containment isolation valves found during Type B and C testing. The volumes that were the major contributors to this
failure are as follows: The ``B'' feedwater line isolation check valves (2&hyph;220&hyph;58B and 2&hyph;220&hyph;62B),
shutdown cooling isolation valves (2&hyph;1001&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;1B, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2B
and 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2C), reactor water clean-up isolation valves (2&hyph;1201, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;3,
2&hyph;1299&hyph;004 and 2&hyph;1299&hyph;005), low pressure coolant injection containment spray isolation
valves (2&hyph;1501&hyph;27B and 2&hyph;1501&hyph;28B), high pressure coolant injection drain pot to suppression
chamber valves (2&hyph;2301&hyph;34 and 2&hyph;2301&hyph;71), traversing incore probe purge check valve (2&hyph;4799&hyph;514),
electrical penetration X&hyph;202W, and drywell bellow X&hyph;113. The total minimum pathway leakage for these
volumes was 685.75 scfh. Each of the above valves and volumes were repaired during the refueling outage and subsequently
passed post-maintenance Type B and C tests prior to restart of Unit 2 for the current operating cycle.
At the time the pertinent requirements of Appendix J were established (1973), the typical nuclear power plant fuel
cycle lasted 12 months. Section III.A.6.(b) may have been written to require a Type A test at every refueling outage_specifying
a numerical cap on the interval to prevent extreme cases of very long intervals (caused by extended shutdowns or operations
at reduced power) between tests. An 18-month cap was reasonable for 12-month fuel cycles, but with the current 18-
and 24-month fuel cycles, it clearly is not sufficient. The intent of Section III.A.6.(b) is to increase the testing
frequency for a containment that exhibits leakage problems, but not to increase it so much that special shutdowns
are required. Refueling outages are the only reasonable time to perform Type A test, since most plants do not have extended
shutdowns at any other time.
In order to add an additional margin of safety and to account for the possible increase in the leakage of a containment
penetration, the licensee has imposed an administrative limit for Dresden, Unit 2, on the total maximum allowable
containment leakage rate until the completion of the current operating cycle. This limit will be 519.0 scfh, which
is 85 percent of the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L

a

). All additional minimum pathway leakage will be added to the current total as operational Type B and C leak rate tests
are performed during the current operating cycle. These corrective measures taken should reduce the chances of D2R14
failing the ``As Found'' Type A ILRT test.

IV



The staff has reviewed ComEd's submittal regarding the Appendix J test interval exemption request. Based on the above,
the staff concludes that the licensee's corrective action and administrative leakage limit have reduced the likelihood
of excessive leakage during the proposed extension of the Type A test interval. Further, considering the intent of
the 18-month interval cap and its relation to longer fuel cycles, the staff finds that the safety benefit to be derived
from performing a Type A test at 18 months rather than 26 months does not justify the hardship of a forced plant shutdown.
Therefore, the staff finds that the requested Type A interval extension should be granted.

This is a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirements as prescribed in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, and is intended to be in effect until July 14, 1995.

In its October 28, 1994, letter, ComEd also identified special circumstances. As discussed above, the exemption
request is for a short duration relative to the 18-month requirement. This meets a criterion for a special circumstance
per 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), i.e., ``The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation
and the licensee or applicant has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation.''



V



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that (1) this exemption is authorized
by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest,
and (2) the Exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made
good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described
in Section III above from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.A.6.(b), to the extent that the 18-month interval
for performing the Type A test may be extended for 242 days until July 14, 1995, on a one-time only basis, for Dresden,
Unit 2.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32 the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 56095).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the course of the past year, the United States has held three rounds of consultations with Japan addressing deregulation
and competition policy issues in a working group established under the Joint Statement on the United States-Japan
Framework for a New Economic Partnership (the ``Framework''). In these consultations, the United States has proposed
specific regulatory changes by the Government of Japan as well as more general changes in regulatory practices, administrative
procedures, and competition policy enforcement. In addition, in other contexts the United States has held other
consultations with Japan addressing deregulation issues in particular sectors or with respect to particular structural
issues.


In March and June, 1994, Japan announced specific, initial deregulatory measures that it would take in the areas of
housing construction; information and telecommunications; import promotion, market access, and distribution;
and finance, securities, and insurance. The Government of Japan currently is in the process of preparing a five-year
plan to follow up on these initial measures.
The Government of Japan invited interested foreign governments to submit specific deregulation requests and comments
to be taken into consideration in preparing its five-year plan. On October 27, the European Union submitted a list
of deregulation requests.
In response to the Government of Japan's invitation, the United States Government, under the coordination of the
Office of the United States Trade Representative, prepared and presented to the Government of Japan, on November
15, 1994, an initial list of deregulation requests and comments for consideration in connection with Japan's five-year
deregulation plan. The list was based on information gathered in the preparation of the annual National Trade Estimates
Report (required by section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2241)), information brought to the
attention of various agencies of the United States Government by U.S. industry, and information gathered by the United
States Government. The list is available for public inspection and copying in the USTR Reading Room: Room 101, Office
of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. An appointment to review the
list may be made by calling Brenda Webb (202) 395&hyph;6186. The USTR Reading Room is open to the public from 10 a.m.
to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The United States Government intends to consult with the Government of Japan in various fora regarding the issues
in the list and regarding the preparation and implementation of the five-year plan. The United States Government
intends to submit to Japan, as appropriate, additional requests or comments regarding the action plan and other deregulation
issues.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; International Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Eliminating the PORTAL Program


November 16, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on October 11, 1994, the International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which items have been prepared primarily by ISCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988).
</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change.


The proposed rule change consists of the elimination of ISCC's PORTAL program.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes


In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(a) In 1989, ISCC obtained approval to provide a service which would permit ISCC to accept data from the National Association
of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') in connection with transactions in the National Securities Clearing Corporation's
PORTAL system. ISCC would forward instructions regarding PORTAL transactions to the Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs
Mobiliers (``CEDEL'') and The Depository Trust Company's Institutional Delivery System for settlement.
ISCC has not processed any PORTAL transactions for over two and one half years. Because this service has not been used
and because currently the NASD does not and in the future the NASD will not transmit information on PORTAL transactions
directly to ISCC, ISCC has determined to discontinue the service. Broker-dealers will have alternative means of
settling transactions in PORTAL securities, including the ability to send data on these transactions directly to
ISCC for transmission to CEDEL.
(b) Since the filing will eliminate a service that has no volume and is therefore not cost effective to maintain, elimination
is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


ISCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


ISCC has not solicited or received any comments. ISCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received
by ISCC.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 thereunder in that it effects a change in an existing service of ISCC that does not adversely effect the safeguarding
of securities of funds in the custody or control of ISCC or for which ISCC is responsible and does not significantly
effect the rights or obligations of ISCC or persons using the service. At any time within sixty days of the filing of
such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

</FOOTNOTE>


3. Applicants seek on order, which will supersede the Prior Orders, to allow the Funds to issue and sell up to four classes
of shares pursuant to a multiple distribution system (the ``Multiple Distribution System''). Under the requested
order, applicants may offer (i) ``Class A'' shares sold subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b&hyph;1
fee which includes a service fee and, under certain circumstances, a CDSC; (ii) ``Class B'' shares sold subject to
a CDSC (for a period typically within a range of three to six years) and a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service
fee; (iii) ``Class C'' shares sold subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service fee and a CDSC; and (iv)
a class of shares (the ``Class Y'' shares) to be offered and sold without any front-end sales load, CDSC or rule 12b&hyph;1
fee payable by the Fund. Class Y shares will be sold to certain types of investors, including certain institutional
investors, as described in a Fund's prospectus. 


4. Each of the four classes of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund. Each of
the four classes of shares will be identical except that 

(i) the rule 12b&hyph;1 fees (which include a service fee within the meaning of Article III, Section 26 of the Rules
of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') (``service fee'')) payable by the
Fund to Distributor will be higher for Class B and Class C shares than they will be for Class A shares; 

(ii) the transfer agency costs attributable to each class may differ; 

(iii) each class may bear different Class Expenses, as defined in condition 1 below;
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
Class expenses include fees under a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. None of the Funds currently has
adopted a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. Any such plan adopted in the future would comply with condition
16 below. 

</FOOTNOTE>


(iv) the four classes will have different exchange privileges; 

(v) only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and 

(vi) each affected class of shares will vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and
on other matters for which separate class voting is appropriate under applicable law; provided that, if the Fund submits
to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan
that would materially increase the amount to be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders
and the Class B shareholders will vote separately by class. 


5. The distribution structure for all classes of shares will comply with the applicable NASD Rules of Fair Practice
relating to sales charges, including front-end, deferred and asset-based sales charges. Additionally, any service
fees paid by the Funds will meet NASD requirements for the imposition of a service fee. 

6. All Class B shares of the Funds will automatically convert to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end
of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. Such number of years, which will depend
on the conversion schedule that applied at the time the Class B shares were originally purchased, may be up to eight.
Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions in respect of Class B shares will
be treated as Class B shares for purposes of the higher rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. However, for purposes of conversion to
Class A shares, all shares in a shareholder's account which are purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions paid in respect of Class B shares (and which have not converted to Class A shares as provided in the following
sentence) will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's account
(other than those in the sub-account referred to in the preceding sentence) convert to Class A shares, an equal pro
rata portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A shares. The conversion of Class B to
Class A shares may be suspended if the opinion of counsel obtained by the Funds that the conversion does not constitute
a taxable event under current federal income tax law is no longer available. 

7. Adviser or Distributor may choose to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class
Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency
costs or any Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by Adviser or Distributor may vary from class to class. Rule 12b&hyph;1
fees, transfer agency costs and any Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected
to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations
to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Fund. 

8. In addition, Adviser or Distributor may waive or reimburse Fund expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement
of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of
Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would
be in turn credited to each class of shares of the Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Fund expenses
apply equally to all classes of a Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund expenses at
different levels for different classes of a Fund. 

9. Adviser's or Distributor's ability to effect any of the waivers or reimbursements described above is subject to
the Funds' receipt of a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service that the effecting of such waivers or reimbursements
does not result in any Fund's dividends or distributions constituting ``preferential dividends'' under the Internal
Revenue Code. 

10. Under the Multiple Distribution System, each of the four classes may be given exchange privileges. Shares of each
class generally will be permitted to be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another
Fund. Class Y shares of a Fund may be exchangeable for Class Y shares of other Funds and shares of certain money market
funds sponsored by Adviser. If the aggregate net asset value of shares of all Funds held by an investor reaches the minimum
amount at which an investor in a Fund may purchase Class A shares of the Fund at net asset value without a front-end sales
load or more on or before December 15 in any year, all Class B or Class C shares of the Fund held by the investor may be exchanged,
at the investor's request, at net asset value, without any front-end sales load or CDSC, for Class A shares of the Fund.
All exchanges that are made at other than relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged will
be made in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3.

11. Applicants seek an order to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of Class A shares sold pursuant to a complete
front-end sales load waiver applicable to large purchases in addition to a CDSC on certain redemptions of Class B and
Class C shares and to waive such a CDSC in certain circumstances. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares
that were purchased more than a specified period (the ``CDSC Period'') prior to their redemption or that were derived
from the reinvestment of distributions; or on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's
account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the period. Any CDSC
will be imposed only on the lesser of the value of the shares redeemed (exclusive of reinvested distributions) or the
total cost of such shares. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it is assumed, unless the shareholder otherwise
specifically directs, that a redemption is made first of any shares in the shareholder's Fund account that are not
subject to a CDSC, second of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends, third of shares held for a period longer
than the CDSC Period, and fourth of shares held for a period no longer than the CDSC Period. In determining the rate of
any applicable CDSC, it is assumed that shares held by the investor for the longest period of time within the CDSC Period
are redeemed. No CDSC will be imposed on any shares issued by the Funds prior to the date of the order requested by this
application except as allowed by the Prior Orders.

12. If a Fund waives or reduces the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in the class
specified. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Funds will comply with the requirements of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the
Act as if such CDSC were a sales load. If the Directors/Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue a waiver of a CDSC,
the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any Class A, Class B or Class C shares purchased
prior to the termination of such waiver would be able to have the CDSC waived as provided in the Fund's prospectus as
in effect at the time of the purchase of such shares.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent the proposed issuance and sale of any of the classes of shares
might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and to be prohibited
by section 18(f)(1) of the Act and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. In addition, applicants
request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder
to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC arrangement.

2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate
against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement will not involve borrowing and will not affect the Funds'
assets or reserves; it also will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a Fund, since all the shares
will participate in all of the Fund's income and all of the Fund's expenses (with the exception of the differing rule
12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs and Class Expenses, if any) on the basis of the relative net assets of the classes.

3. Under the Multiple Distribution System, mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to all classes of shares
in a Fund. Further, since all classes of shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference
or priority over any other class in a Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation
preferences with respect to particular assets, no class will have any right to require that lapsed dividends be paid
before dividends are declared on the class and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account).



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:

1. The Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a
Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the Class A, Class B, Class
C and Class Y shares of a Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate rule 12b&hyph;1 fees allocated
to each of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the Fund and the fact that the Class Y shares will not bear any rule 12b&hyph;1
fees; (b) the impact of the disproportionate transfer agency costs attributable to each of the Class A, Class B, Class
C and Class Y shares; (c) the different Class Expenses, if any, which shall be limited to the following expenses determined
by the Directors/Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of shares:

(i) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class,

(ii) Commission registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares,

(iii) blue sky registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares,

(iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services required to support the shareholders of a specific class,

(v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares,

(vi) Directors/Trustees fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares,

(vii) accounting expenses relating to a specific class of shares;

(viii) any fees imposed pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan; and

(ix) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that lawfully may be allocated to one class which shall
be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (d) the fact that the Class A, Class B and Class C shares will
each vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and that the Class A, Class B, Class C
and Class Y shares will each vote separately as a class with respect to other matters for which separate class voting
is appropriate under applicable law, provided that, if the Fund submits to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and
Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan that would materially increase the amount to
be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders will vote
separately by class as provided in condition 2 below; (e) the different exchange privileges of the Class A, Class B,
Class C and Class Y shares; (f) the fact that only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and (g) the designation
of each class of shares of the Fund.

2. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Class A shares under the plan, existing Class B shares will stop converting into Class A unless the
Class B shareholders, voting separately by a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees shall take such
action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class B shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New
Class A''), identical in all material respects to Class A as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no
later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Class A. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees
to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Class B shares for a new class (``New
Class B''), identical to existing Class B shares in all material respects except that New Class B will convert into
New Class A. New Class A or New Class B may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described
in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Directors/Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Class A or New Class B shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Class B shares sold
after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Class A shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided
that the material features of the Class A plan and the relationship of such plan to the Class B shares are disclosed in
an effective registration statement. 
3. The Directors/Trustee of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall
have approved the Multiple Distribution System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Distribution System
by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Directors/Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations
of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution System
will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Distribution System is in the best interests
of both the Funds and their respective shareholders. 
4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under
the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the
four classes of shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall
take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Adviser and Distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees. It a conflict arises,
Adviser and Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing one or more new
registered management investment companies. 
5. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and
shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended
from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular
class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related
to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to its Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, to the extent any dividends
are paid, will be calculated in the same manner at the same time on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that
rule 12b&hyph;1 fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and
any incremental transfer agency costs or Class Expenses relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares will
be borne exclusively by that class.
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the Class
A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes, have been
reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to
the staff of the Commission as Exhibit D to this application, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate
to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert,
or an appropriate Substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being
made under the Multiple Distribution System and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to
the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as
part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work
papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide),
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Funds for such work papers
by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief
Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and
Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and
the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
8. The initial determination of Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a class and any subsequent changes
thereto has been or will be reviewed and approved by the Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent
Directors/Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by
a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Directors/Trustees, and the Directors/Trustees shall review at
least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the four classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the four classes of shares. This representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 7 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if the Expert or appropriate Substitute Expert does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
10. The prospectuses of the Funds relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will contain a statement
to the effect that a salesperson and any other person may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.
11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares may appropriately
be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform
to such standards.
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the Directors/Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees.
13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of each
Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder
reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related
to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on
a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares, it will disclose
the expenses and/or performance data applicable to the four classes. The information provided by applicants for
publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present
separately Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their
rule 12b&hyph;1 or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
15. Class B shares will convert into Class A shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without
the imposition of any sales load, fee or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an
asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules
of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which
they were subject prior to the conversion.
16. Any non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan adopted by a Fund will be adopted and operated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject
to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed Rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations 



1. The Trust is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.
Currently, the Trust is authorized to offer three separate investment portfolios (the ``Portfolios''): Pacific
Capital Cash Assets Trust, Pacific Capital Tax-Free Cash Assets Trust, and Pacific Capital U.S. Treasuries Cash
Assets Trust. Each Portfolio holds itself out as a ``money market fund'' and therefore seeks to maintain a stable net
asset value of $1.00 per share pursuant to rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. Aquila Distributors, Inc., a registered broker-dealer,
serves as the distributor of the Trust's shares. Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited serves as investment adviser to
the Trust. Applicants request that relief extend to any future trust, series or portfolio of a Trust that is advised
by the Adviser or whose shares are distributed by the Distributor. 

2. The Trust proposes to offer two classes of shares of each of its Portfolios: Original Shares and Service Shares (the
``Dual Class System''). The currently outstanding shares of each Portfolio will be classified as Original Shares.
If exemptive relief is granted, Original Shares will be sold solely to (1) financial institutions for the investment
of funds for which they act in a fiduciary, agency, investment advisory or custodial capacity; (2) persons entitled
to exchange into Original Shares under the exchange privileges of the Trust; and (3) shareholders owning shares of
the Trust of record on the date that both classes of shares are first made available. Original Shares will be sold without
the imposition of any sales charges and will not be subject to any asset-based distribution charges permitted by rule
12b&hyph;1 under the Act. However, Original Shares will continue to be subject to the normal and customary expenses
of the Trust such as advisory and administrative fees and other normal operating expenses. 

3. Service Shares will be offered to customers of banks and other financial institutions (``Service Organizations'')
that typically are compensated by service or distribution fees paid by the mutual funds offered to their customers
rather than by transactions or other fees paid directly by such customers. The fees paid by this class could be in the
nature of (1) a distribution fee payable in connection with a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act
(a ``Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan''); (2) an administrative services fee payable pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative
services plan (an ``Administrative Services Plan''); or (3) a distribution fee and an administrative fee as a result
of a combination of the two types of plans. 

4. Each of the Portfolios has adopted a currently effective distribution plan under rule 12b&hyph;1, but neither
the Trust nor the Portfolios make payments under this plan. 

5. Under amended Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans to be implemented with the Dual Class System, the Trust or each Portfolio, on
behalf of the Services Shares, would typically enter into agreements with and pay the Distributor or the Service Organization
for performing certain services, some of which could be construed as distribution assistance. The expenses of such
payments would be borne entirely by the Service Shares shareholders. Services provided in accordance with the terms
of the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan would not be duplicative of any services to be provided to the Trust or its Portfolios by
the administrator, distributor or transfer agent. 

6. Under an Administrative Services Plan, the Trust or the Portfolios, on behalf of the Service Shares, would have
the ability to enter into agreements with Service Organizations in which each organization will agree to provide
certain services to its clients, members or customers, who purchase shares. The provision of services under the Administrative
Services Plan would not be duplicative of any services to be provided to the Trust or a Protfolio by its administrator,
distributor, or transfer agent. Each Portfolio would pay a Service Organization for its service in accordance with
the terms of its particular Administrative Services Plan, and the expense of such payment will be borne entirely by
the beneficial owners of the Service Shares.

7. Under the Dual Class System, each share in a Portfolio, regardless of class, will represent an interest in the Portfolio
and will have identical voting rights, powers, qualifications, terms and conditions, and, in proportion to each
Share's net asset value, liquidation rights and preferences. Each class will differ in that: (a) Each class will have
a different class designation; (b) only the Service Shares will bear the expenses applicable to an Administrative
Services Plan or Rule 12b&hyph;1 plan; (c) each class would bear certain other expenses that are directly attributable
only to that class (``Class Expenses''), as set forth in condition 1; (d) classes will vote separately with respect
to matters relating to the Fund's Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; and (e) the exchange privileges could vary among the classes.


8. The classes of shares of the Portfolios will differ with respect to exchange privileges among the Portfolios and
the portfolios of certain other investment companies advised by the Adviser. All exchanges of shares will be effected
in accordance with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.


9. Portfolio expenses (such as advisory fees) will be allocated 

pro rata, 

to each class on the basis of the relative net asset values of the respective classes. Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan payments,
Administrative Plan payments, and Class Expenses which are attributable to a particular class of shares will be allocated
to that particular class. As a result, the net income and net asset value per share of a class may be different than the
new income and net asset value per share of another class of shares in the same Portfolio.



Applicants' Legal Analysis




1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) exempting them from sections 18(f)(1),
18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares representing interests in the
same investment portfolio might be deemed: (1) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g) of the Act in violation of section 18(f)(1); or (2) to violate the equal voting provisions of section
18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement would permit the Trust to facilitate the distribution
of its securities and enhance the scope and depth of its shareholder services without assuming excessive accounting
and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of
expenses and the voting rights relating to the Administrative Services Plan or Rule 12b-1 Plan in the manner described
above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.



Applicants' Conditions




Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:


1. Each class of shares of each Portfolio of the Trust will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments
of a Portfolio of the Trust, and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between
the classes of shares of the Trust will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate Administrative Services
Plan payments, Rule 12b-1 Plan payments, and Class Expenses which will be limited to (i) transfer agent fees as identified
by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing
and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to the current shareholders
of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a
class; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific
class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class; and (vii) trustees fees incurred as a
result of issues relating to one class; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Portfolio's
Rule 12b-1 Plan and Administrative Services Plan; (c) exchange features; and (d) class designation differences.


2. The trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of two classes
of shares (the ``Dual Class System''). The minutes of the respective meetings of the trustees regarding the deliberations
of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Dual Class System will reflect in detail the
reasons for the trustees' determination that the Dual Class System is in the best interests of both the Trust and its
shareholders.


3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trust, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the two classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the non-interested trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited as adviser and Aquila Distributors,
Inc. as distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict
arises, the adviser and the distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing
a new registered management investment company.


4. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the trustees
who are not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by a Portfolio to meet class expenses shall provide to the trustees of the Trust, and the trustees shall
review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.

5. Any Administrative Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
of Service Shares need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 
6. The trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subjected to the review and
approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 
7. Dividends paid by a Portfolio with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will
be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments
made by Service Shares under the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Services Plan, and any Class Expenses, will
be borne exclusively by that class. 
8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends and distributions of the classes
of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between those classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations
are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant
to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request
by the Trust (which the Trust agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written
request to the Trust for such work papers, by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the
Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any
Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report
on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards (``SAS'')
No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will be ``reports
on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described
in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by
the AICPA from time to time. 
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset values, dividends and distributions of the two classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
between the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report
referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an
ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate
corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.

10. The prospectus for each Portfolio will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person
entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Portfolio shares may receive different compensation
with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the same Portfolio.



11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to such standards.



12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
with respect to the Dual Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees.



13. Each Portfolio will disclose the expenses, performance data, distribution arrangement, services, fees, sales
loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to both classes in every prospectus, regardless
of whether both classes are offered through each prospectus. Each Portfolio will disclose the respective expenses
and performance data applicable to all classes of shares of the Portfolio in every shareholder report. The shareholder
reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related
to each Portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Portfolio's per share data, however, will be
prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Portfolio. To the extent any advertisement
or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares in a Portfolio, it
will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares in such Portfolio.
The information provided by the applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of each Portfolio's
net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately.



14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order will not imply SEC approval, authorization,
or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Trust may make pursuant to its Administrative Services
or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

Notice of task amendment for the Production Certification Working Group.

SUMMARY: 

This notice informs the public of an amendment to the original task assigned to the Production Certification Working
Group of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee.




</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Mr. Daniel P. Salvano, Aircraft Certification Service (AIR&hyph;3), 800 Independence avenue S.W., Washington,

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190; January 22, 1991, and 58 FR 9230; February 19, 1993). One issue being addressed by ARAC is aircraft certification
procedures. This issue involves the procedures for aircraft certification found in parts 21, 39, and 183 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), and Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36 (SFAR 36), which are the responsibility
of the FAA Director, Aircraft Certification Service.





On March 19, 1993, the Production Certification Working Group was established, and notice of establishment was published
in the 

Federal Register 

on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16574). This Working Group was charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning
the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts, F, G, H, J, K, and O of FAR
Part 21.

After the task was assigned, it became apparent that subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45 should
have been included in the review; therefore, the Production Certification Working Group task statement is amended
to include subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45.

Task: The task statement assigned to the Production Certification Working Group is, therefore, amended to read as
follows: The Production Certification Working Group is charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning
the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts F, G, H, J, K, L, and O of FAR
Part 21 and subparts A and B of Part 45. These recommendations involve streamlining the rules to establish a more modern,
standardized set of production approval requirements more responsive to current industry production practices.
The Production Certification Working Group will submit recommendations to the ARAC, which will determine whether
to forward them to the FAA.

Request for Public Participation in the Development of the National Program Plan for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), formerly called Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Transportation solicits public comment on a third draft of a National Program Plan (the Plan) for
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), formerly called Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS). ITS applies
advanced technologies such as information processing, communications, and electronics to surface transportation
needs. The Plan is being developed based on a set of user services, each of which is designed to respond to the needs of
particular users. The draft Plan attempts to integrate Federal, State, local government, and private sector activities
in a single document to present a coherent picture of how the public and private sectors will work together to achieve
ITS program goals. The Plan seeks to reflect the consensus view of all parties interested in the development and deployment
of ITS. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments on the November 1994 draft are due 
December 30, 1994. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extent possible. 


</DATE>

of the November 1994 draft; others may obtain a copy by contacting the Federal Highway Administration, HVH&hyph;2,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The objective of the ITS program is to apply advanced technology in the areas of information processing, communications,
control, and electronics to improve safety, reduce congestion, increase mobility, reduce the energy and environmental
harm caused by transportation, and increase economic productivity. The ITS program also incorporates the use of
strategic planning and innovative management practices at all levels of government to implement those initiatives
which enhance our national surface transportation system, strengthen our economy, and benefit a broad range of users.

To that end, the third draft incorporates various of the comments received through the earlier notice process and
the public forums, as well as those received from individual members of ITS AMERICA, a broad-based, non-profit organization
that also serves as a utilized Federal Advisory Committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.
2). ITS AMERICA will also be distributing copies of the Plan to its membership and preparing consensus comments on
the Plan; therefore, member comments to ITS AMERICA need not be duplicated in comments to the DOT docket. 
The Plan is intended to clearly present the ITS program to Congress, other government leaders, and private sector
entities. It is intended to guide investment decisions in the development and deployment of ITS products and services
to be made by private entities, the Federal government, and local governments; to facilitate prioritization and
coordination of ITS development activities; to reduce duplication of effort; and to ensure ITS program activities
are directed toward deployment of ITS services in a nationally compatible intermodal system. 
These services have been grouped into the following categories or ``bundles'': 

Travel and Transportation Management

, which would improve the flow of traffic and provide travel-related information to the public; 

Travel Demand Management, 

which would reduce vehicle demand by encouraging modes other than the single occupancy vehicle; 

Public Transportation Operations

, which would assist in delivering improved public transportation systems; 

Commercial Vehicle Operations

, which would improve the efficiency and safety of commercial fleet operations; 

Electronic Payment

, which would allow travelers to pay for transportation services with electronic cards or tags; 

Emergency Management

, which can be used by police, fire, and rescue authorities to improve their management of, and response to, emergency
situations; and 

Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems,

 which would provide improved vehicle safety. 
The deployment of these user services will depend on a range of issues that will be assessed in formulating and implementing
the Plan, including cost, public acceptance, the maturity or availability of the technologies, and regulatory issues.
The Plan will also serve as the framework for a continuing process that will assess progress and allow government and
private sector investment decisions to be made after the views of all interested parties have been considered. 
Because the Plan is being developed with the user as the focus, the Department is interested in participation from
a broad range of individuals and organizations including, but not limited to, public officials from State and local
governments, consumer groups, vehicle manufacturers and other private sector entities, transit authorities,
toll authorities, small businesses, academic institutions, associations, and individual citizens. 
This is the third notice on the Plan. The first notice, at 58 FR 65814 (December 15, 1993), contained background information
on the national ITS program, including a detailed description of the user services. The second notice, 59 FR 26552
(May 20, 1994), announced a series of five public forums (held around the country in June 1994) to obtain input on the
Plan development. Comments received in response to both notices, and the public forums, have been utilized in preparing
the third draft of the Program Plan that is now available. 
This draft of the Plan has been substantially revised from the previous draft, and edited to reduce its length and remove
redundancies. A new chapter has been added that discusses the societal, economic, legislative, and other forces
that led to the ITS program. User Service Integration and National Compatibility have been divided into separate
chapters, and the discussion of telecommunications issues has been expanded. The Deployment and Deployment Support
chapters have been substantially revised to reflect 5-, 10-, and 20-year deployment scenarios, provide an analysis
of the potential affects of different levels of public and private sector participation in ITS deployment, and a description
of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. A new Travel Demand Management bundle has been created that
encompasses the Pre-Trip Travel Information, Ride Matching and Reservation, and Demand Management and Operations
user services. 
In response to a number of comments, a Synopsis of the Plan has been developed and is included with the third draft. 
This third draft is intended to be the final draft before publication of the first edition the Plan in March, 1995. The
Plan will then be updated periodically to reflect changes in the development and deployment of the ITS program. 


Information Requested 


The Department is especially interested in public comment on Chapter 6, Deployment, and Chapter 7, Deployment Support,
the deployment scenarios presented, the analysis of the effects of different levels of public and private sector
participation in ITS deployment, and the discussion of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. Respondents
are also asked to indicate their agreement with the publication of this document, following the comment period and
with comments considered, as the first edition of the National ITS Program Plan. 
Any additional information, suggestions, opinions or other comments that would assist in further developing the
Plan would be welcome.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;103; Notice 1]</RINDOCK>



<DOCTITLE>American Transportation Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>


American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) of Conway, Arkansas, has determined that some of its vehicles fail
to comply with 49 CFR 571.120, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 120, ``Tire Selection and Rims for
Vehicles Other Than Passenger Cars,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and
Noncompliance Reports.'' AmTran has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of
49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle
safety.
This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgment concerning the merits of the application.
Paragraph S5.3 of FMVSS No. 120 states that each vehicle must have a label affixed which includes the size designation
of the tires and the size designation of the rims.
AmTran produced approximately 38,000 buses and school buses from 1987 through 1994 which do not meet the labeling
requirements stated in the standard. The vehicles lack the rim diameter designation on the label. The label does include
the rim width and complete tire size.
AmTran supports its application with the following:



American Transportation (AmTran) requests that an exemption be granted based on the grounds that the noncompliance
is inconsequential as it related to motor vehicle safety. The rim width is listed on the certification label; however,
the rim diameter is not listed. The complete tire size, including the diameter (which is identical to the rim diameter),
is listed on each label. Therefore, [AmTran] believes that sufficient information is available for the user to match
tire and rim sizes appropriately.



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of AmTran, described
above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that six
copies be submitted.
All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.
Comment closing date: December 22, 1994.

Axle Weights of Public Transit Buses; Extension of Exclusion Period 


AGENCIES: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA), DOT.

 

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to study and provide recommendations to address the matter
of public transit buses that exceed Interstate System axle weight limits. The Congress also excluded public transit
buses from Interstate System axle weight limits for 2 years (until October 6, 1994) and provided that the Secretary
could extend the exclusion for an additional year. The study was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994,
but legislation would be required to implement its recommendation to allow higher bus axle weights until lighter
buses can be developed and this will require additional time. Therefore, renewing the exclusion for 1 more year will
allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System at axle weights authorized by each state
while a permanent solution is implemented.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The exclusion of public transit buses from the Interstate System axle weight limits is extended to October 6, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 341 of the FY 1993 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;388,
106 Stat. 1520, at 1552) amended section 1023 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub.
L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, at 1951) by adding a new paragraph (h). Paragraph (h)(2) required the Secretary to
conduct a study of the maximum axle weight limits of ``public transit vehicles'' on the Interstate System. Paragraph
(h)(1) excluded ``any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus'' from the single- and tandem-axle weight limits imposed on the Interstate System by the second sentence in 23
U.S.C. 127 for 2 years from the effective date of the legislation, October 6, 1992, and authorized the Secretary to
renew the exclusion for an additional year. 


States that fail to enforce the Interstate System weight limits could be penalized by the loss of their Federal highway
funds under 23 U.S.C. 141(c)(2). Before the exclusion became effective, buses were, on occasion, stopped by State
enforcement personnel and forced to unload passengers until they were no longer overweight. 
The study required by paragraph (h)(2) was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994. However, action to address
overweight axles of public transit buses on the Interstate System will require additional time. A 1-year extension
will allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System without the threat of possible funding
sanctions or the removal of passengers while a permanent solution to the problem is implemented. 
Therefore, any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus is excluded, until October 6, 1995, from the second sentence of section 23 U.S.C. 127 relating to axle weight limitations
for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Issues for Public Comment



A. Background



The public meetings are part of an ongoing dialogue with the Administration to assess the security needs and concerns
of users of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). The NII is a system of high-speed telecommunications
networks, databases, and advanced computer systems that will make electronic information_such as insurance and
financial products, health and educational records, and communication of both a commercial and non-commercial
nature_more widely available and accessible than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will
dramatically affect the way in which information and information services are created, used, and delivered throughout
the world.

<DOCNO> FR941122-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941122-2-00099 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Consequently, broad public and commercial use of the NII hinges upon implementing technologies, policies, and practices
that not only ensure that users of information systems have access to information when and where they need it, but that
subjects of information records are able to protect themselves from unauthorized or inappropriate use of information.

``Americans will not use the NII to its full potential unless they trust that information will go where and when they
want it and nowhere else,'' declared Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs
at OMB and chair of the Forum. ``The Federal government is a primary user of the NII and thus a catalyst for change. Yet
the NII will be designed, built, owned, operated, and used primarily by the private sector, making it essential that
security on the NII be considered in partnership with the public.''

To address these critical issues, the Vice President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The
IITF is chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise
in technical, legal, and policy areas pertinent to the NII. The mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the
Administration's vision for the NII.

The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security in the
NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the
Office of Management and Budget.

In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure.
The Advisory Council represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce
on issues relating to the NII. Mega-Project III, one of three work groups of the Advisory Council, is responsible for
addressing security, intellectual property, and privacy issues as they relate to the NII.



B. Structure and Content of Public Meeting



Security is linked inextricably to broad public use of the NII. The technologies, policies, and procedures used to
ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted information, information
products, and services on the NII will determine whether, how, and to what extent digitally linked information services
will be broadly used in such critical sectors as health, education, finance, and insurance.

Development of policies and procedures that will ensure the security of commercial and non-commercial information
and communications on the NII requires study from different perspectives, whether that of the subject of the information,
the user of the information, or the creator of the information. The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input from parties
who represent these views in the areas of health, education, finance, and insurance.

Solutions to these concerns will come vita technical solutions, as well as legal and policy mechanisms. The Forum
and Mega-Project III seek input in this area as well. Specifically, what legal measures, policy mechanisms, and technological
solutions, or combinations thereof, can be used to effectively protect the security of health, education, financial,
and insurance information delivered or made accessible on the NII?

A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will be assembled to discuss the following topics with a panel of senior Administration
officials, members of the Security Issues Forum, and members of the Advisory Council, and to field questions and comments
from other members of the public.

Position statements for the meeting, ``Security for Financial and Insurance Information in the NII,'' should address
four principal questions:

1. How do you envision the NII being used by the finance and insurance industries to provide enhanced products and services
to customers or to improve operations?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941122-2-00137 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941122-2-00099 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Specifically, what types of products and services are you contemplating delivering or making available, or would
you like to see delivered or made available on the NII?

2. What threats do you foresee in making products and services available via the NII? Such threats might include fraud,
unauthorized access, breach of confidentiality or privacy, breach of integrity, and lack of reliability.

3. What legal, policy, and ethical issues do you foresee affecting usage of the NII? Such issues may include liability,
information/property rights, equal access, document/records management, legal admissibility/evidentiary
requirements, and auditability.

4. What kinds of administrative or technical solutions are you aware of, or would you like to see developed, to address
security, legal, and ethical concerns? Such solutions may include international agreements, criminal laws, public
key encryption, and digital signatures.

Position statements for the meeting, ``Security for Health and Education Information in the NII,'' should address
five principal questions:

1. What enhancements in electronic data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to protect the confidentiality
of personal health and education information?

2. What enhancements in electronic data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to improve data users' access
to individual health and education information?

3. How can the NII be constructed to address and satisfy both of these needs simultaneously?

4. What safeguards need to be developed to limit children's access to inappropriate material through the NII?

5. What technical solutions are available, or can be developed, in order to address these data security concerns?



II. Guidelines for Participation in the Public Hearing



Individuals who would like to participate on a panel must request an opportunity to do so no later than November 30,
1994 by submitting a brief, 1&hyph;2 page summary position statement. If approved, each participant will be allowed
to present brief opening remarks. Primary participating, however, shall be during the general discussion to follow,
according to the format described above.
