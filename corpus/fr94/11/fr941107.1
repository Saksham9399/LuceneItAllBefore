Milk in the Tennessee Valley Marketing Area; Proposed Temporary Revision of Certain Provisions of the Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed revision of rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites comments on a proposal to reduce the supply plant shipping requirement of the Tennessee Valley
Federal milk order (Order 11) for the months of March through July 1995. The proposed action was requested by Armour
Food Ingredients Company (Armour), which operates a proprietary supply plant pooled under Order 11. Armour contends
the action is necessary to prevent the uneconomical movement of milk and to ensure that producer milk associated with
the market in the fall will continue to be pooled in the spring and summer months. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments are due no later than December 7, 1994. 


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South
Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.



The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of &sect;1011.7(b) of the order, the proposed revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the handling
of milk in the Tennessee Valley marketing area is being considered for the period of March 1, 1995, through July 31,
1995. 
All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies
of their views to USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 30th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 
All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

Statement of Consideration 



The proposed revision would reduce the supply plant shipping requirement from 40 to 30 percent for the period of March
through July 1995. The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total
quantity of milk physically received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and
February, and 40 percent in each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy
Division to increase or decrease this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision
is necessary to obtain needed shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 

Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping
requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that the 40 percent requirement could
jeopardize the continued association of producers who have supplied the Order 11 market in the fall. 

Armour anticipates that marketing conditions in 1995 will mirror those in 1993 and 1994, when the shipping percentage
was also reduced. It expects milk supplies to be adequate to meet the Class I needs of the market. 

In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage
as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of March 1 through July 31,
1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under Executive Order 12866. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed
rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these determinations. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement
is needed. 



Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Cotton Production Stabilization_10.052. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of the proposed rule
do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals.

This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115
(June 24, 1983). 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require
clearance by the OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. 



Request for Public Comment 



Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the
final rule. 



Background 



In accordance with section 103(h)(5) of the 1949 Act, an ARP may be established for the 1995 crop of ELS cotton if it is
determined that the total supply of ELS cotton, in the absence of an ARP, will be excessive, taking into account the
need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable prices and to meet a national emergency. 

Land diversion payments also may be made to producers of ELS cotton, whether or not an ARP for ELS cotton is in effect,
if needed to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of ELS cotton to desirable goals. A paid land diversion
has not been considered because, given the existing supply/use situation, it is not needed. 

If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (including a zero
percentage reduction) to the ELS crop acreage base for each ELS cotton-producing farm. Producers who knowingly produce
ELS cotton in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm are ineligible for CCC ELS cotton price support loans and
payments with respect to that farm. 

Based on 1995 supply/use estimates as of September 1994, four options are considered. However, because of changes
in the 1995 supply/use situation that may develop between now and the announcement date for the acreage reduction
percentage, the actual percentage may be different from the options discussed in this proposed rule. 

The 1995 ARP options considered are: 

Option 1. 10-percent acreage reduction percentage. 
Option 2. 15-percent acreage reduction percentage. 
Option 3. 20-percent acreage reduction percentage. 
Option 4. 25-percent acreage reduction percentage. 

The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in the following table.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to a request by Nicolas P. Retsinas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary's Designee
to the Finance Board, the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks conducted public forums in August and September of 1994 to seek
comment on three topics: (1) The contribution of the System and its members to housing and community development lending;
(2) the capacity for the System to support community lenders and community-based lending; and, (3) appropriate System
governance structure. Each FHLBank public forum discussed several related questions: 



(1) How can the System facilitate housing and community development lending through the existing network of community-based
lenders? 

(2) How should the community development mission of the System be defined with regard to the types of lending and collateral
requirements compatible with the safety and soundness requirements of the System? 

(3) How is the changing membership base affecting the System? 

(4) Building on the success of the Affordable Housing and the Community Investment programs, how can we demonstrate
the contribution that member institutions make through the regular advances program. 

(5) What type of System governance structure would enable the System to better realize its public purpose potential,
while ensuring continued safety and soundness? 

The Finance Board is interested in the views of System members, community groups, trade associations, government
sponsored enterprises, federal and state agencies and others on the topics addressed in the 12 FHLBank forums. To
assist interested persons in responding, summaries of the sessions held by the FHLBanks will be made available prior
to the public hearing. Requests for this material may be made by writing or calling (refer to the information listed
in the 

ADDRESSES

 portion of this notice). Most of these issues were also addressed in five reports on the FHLBank System submitted to
Congress pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Congressionally-mandated reports were
submitted by the Finance Board, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the General Accounting Office,
the Congressional Budget Office and a FHLBank Shareholder Study Committee.

Additionally, the Finance Board invites testimony regarding potential FHLBank legislation. Specifically, the
Finance Board welcomes testimony on what should be contained in a comprehensive FHLBank legislative package addressing
the following four areas: (1) The structure of FHLBank capital; (2) the statutory definition of the FHLBank System's
mission; (3) FHLBank membership and borrowing requirements; and, (4) the appropriate structure of FHLBank System
regulation and governance. 

On December 8, the Finance Board hearing will be directed at the topics that were the subject of the FHLBank public forums
and on the issues to be addressed in legislation. On December 9, the Finance Board will arrange panels on each of four
specific legislative issue areas. Witnesses should indicate a preference for either testifying during the more
general discussion on December 8 or identify a specific topic panel on which they would like to participate on December
9. 

Persons wishing to participate in these hearings should send a written request to the address listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 portion of this notice, to be received no later than November 16, 1994. A request to participate in the hearing must
include the following information: 

(A) The name, title, address, business telephone and fax number of the participant; 

(B) The entity or entities that the participant will be representing; 

(C) An indication as to the witnesses' preference to testify on the more general topics of December 8 or on one of the
following specific panels planned for December 9: (1) The structure of FHLBank capital; (2) the statutory definition
of the FHLBank's mission; (3) statutory FHLBank membership and borrowing requirements; and, (4) the appropriate
structure of FHLBank regulation and governance. 

Depending on the number of requests received, participants may be limited in the length of their oral presentations.
However, the Finance Board will provide time at the end of the December 8 hearing for brief general comments from the
public. The Finance Board will notify participants of the date and time scheduled for their presentation. In establishing
panels of participants for presentations, the Finance Board reserves the right to limit the number of participants
and to select, at its discretion, those persons who may make oral presentations if more requests are received for participation
than may be accommodated in the time available. 

Participants will be required to submit written statements in advance of the hearing date. These written statements
should incorporate the major points to be presented at the hearing and should be accompanied by an executive summary
of no more than three to five pages. Written statements must be received no later than November 28, 1994, and should

Discussion 


On August 23, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04, amendment 39&hyph;8674 (58 FR 
47036, September 7, 1993), applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series 
airplanes, to require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections 
to detect cracking of the upper main fitting of the nose landing gear (NLG), and 
replacement or repair of cracked parts. That action was prompted by reports of cracking 
in the main fittings of the NLG. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent 
failure of the main fitting, which could lead to collapse of the NLG during landing. 
AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 is applicable only to British Aerospace Model BAe 146 series 
airplanes. Since issuance of that AD, however, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), 
which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, has advised that additional 
airplanes may be subject to the same unsafe condition addressed by the existing AD 
action. Further analysis has indicated that cracking of the upper main fitting of the NLG 
may occur on all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes. 
British Aerospace has issued Revision 2, dated July 10, 1993, of Service Bulletin 
S.B. 32&hyph;131. The inspection procedures described in this revision are identical to those 
described in Revision 1 of the service bulletin (which was referenced in AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04). 
This revision only expands the effectivity listing to include additional airplanes. The 
CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the 
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the 
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary 
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would require repetitive eddy current or ultra high sensitivity penetrant inspections, and 
replacement or repair of cracked parts. The actions would be required to be accomplished 
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This proposed rule would 
be applicable only to Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes. 



(

Note: 

The FAA's normal policy is that when an AD requires a substantive 
change, such as a change (expansion) in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by 
removing it from the system and a new AD is added. In the case of this AD action, the 
FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 to expand its applicability 
to include Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series airplanes as the additional affected airplanes. 
However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by a 
supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance 
record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a 
separate AD applicable only to these additional airplanes. This AD does not supersede 
AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;04 are required to 
continue to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate 
AD action, and is applicable to all British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ series 
airplanes.) 



The FAA estimates that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on 
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
be $450, or $150 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the 
United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all 
British Aerospace Model BAe 146&hyph;100A, &hyph;200A, &hyph;300A and Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A, 
&hyph;RJ85A, and &hyph;RJ100A series airplanes equipped with certain Air Cruiser evacuation 
slides. The CAA advises that, during operational checks of evacuation slides on these 
airplanes, the inflation valves failed to deploy the evacuation slide properly. Subsequent 
investigation, conducted by Air Cruisers (the manufacturer of the evacuation slides), 
revealed that the existing design of the inflation valves requires excessive operating pull 
force to activate deployment of the evacuation slide. This condition, if not corrected, 
could result in failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically, which necessitates 
the flight crew to manually deploy the slide. This situation could delay or impede the 
evacuation of passengers during an emergency. 
British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 25&hyph;328, Revision 2, dated 
July 10, 1993, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections to verify proper 
deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions 
to correct discrepancies. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. 
Addditionally, Air Cruisers Company has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 201&hyph;25&hyph;17, 
dated June 4, 1992, which describes procedures for modification of the inflation valve of 
the evacuation slide. This modification entails replacing the existing valve with a new, 
improved valve. The new valve has a lower maximum operating pull force, which will 
permit the evacuation slide to deploy automatically on demand. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the 
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the 
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary 
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would require repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide 
at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. The proposed AD would also require
modification of the inflation valve of the evacuation slide, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 41 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts 
would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$8,610, or $210 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A and &hyph;RJ85A
series airplanes. The CAA advises that, during an inspection of the cable terminals in the auxiliary power unit (APU)
starter circuit, incorrect cable terminals were found installed on these airplanes. 
Investigation revealed that nickel-plated copper terminals were installed during production instead of aluminum/copper
terminals. Nickel-plated copper terminals that contact APU starter cables having an aluminum core result in dissimilar
metal corrosion. 
Such corrosion could lead to the loss of power to the APU, and the consequent inability of the pilot to start the APU when
necessary in a situation where an airplane's primary or other electrical power sources are lost. If this were to occur,
all electrical power on the airplane may be lost. 
Avro has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 49&hyph;40, Revision 1, dated March 17, 1994, which describes procedures for
a detailed visual inspection to identify the cable terminals fitted to cables KA47 and KA48 in the APU starter circuit
at terminal block KA9. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removing the cable terminals identified
as part number (P/N) S1007&hyph;042 and installing new cable terminals having P/N S1006&hyph;040. 
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection to identify the
cable terminals fitted to cables KA47 and KA48 on the APU starter circuit at terminal block KA9, removal of certain
cable terminals, and installation of certain new cable terminals. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $250 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $997.50, or $332.50 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

I. Executive Summary 



The Commission's current regulations require disclosure of legal proceedings

21

 involving executive officers, directors, persons nominated to become directors, promoters, significant shareholders,
participants in proxy contests, and other specified persons (``designated persons'').

22

 The principal provisions are found in Items 401 (f) and (g) of Regulation S-K and Item 401(d) of Regulation S-B,

23

 but a number of forms and schedules require similar disclosure, as discussed below.

24

 A review of current requirements has raised questions about the adequacy of the five-year period for reporting such
proceedings. In light of these questions, as well as the enactment of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny
Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Remedies Act''),

25

 the Commission proposes to expand the disclosure provisions and the time frame of the current requirements and to
eliminate the differences in requirements among various forms. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


21

</FOOTNAME>
The term ``legal proceeding,'' as used in this release and in current Item 401, includes criminal convictions, as
well as findings, orders or sanctions in civil and administrative actions, that have not been reversed, suspended
or vacated. It also includes criminal actions pending at the time a disclosure document is filed, and the initiation
of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. With respect to proposed Item 401, the term also encompasses sanctions issued
by securities and commodities self-regulatory organizations that have not been reversed or otherwise rendered
of no effect. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


22

</FOOTNAME>
As used in this release, ``designated person'' includes the persons identified in the following disclosure provisions,
forms and schedules: 

S-K Item 401 (f) and (g) and S-B Item 401(d)

_executive officers, directors, persons nominated to become directors, as well as promoters and control persons
of newly public companies; 

Schedules 13D, 13E&hyph;3, and 14D&hyph;1

_the person filing the schedule. In addition, if the filer is a general or limited partnership, syndicate or other
group_the individual general partners of general or limited partnerships, each member of such syndicate or group
and each person controlling such partner or member; if such general partner, member or person controlling such partner
or member is a corporation, or if the filer is a corporation_the corporation's directors and executive officers,
persons controlling such corporation, and directors and executive officers of any corporation ultimately in control
of such corporation; 

Proxy statements relating to election contests

_any participant in an election contest, as defined by Instruction 3 to Item 4 of Schedule 14A (in addition to the Item
401 disclosure generally required in a proxy statement involving an election of directors, contested or otherwise);


Regulation A Offering Circular (Model B)

_executive officers, directors and persons nominated to become directors; 

Prospectuses Relating to Oil and Gas Programs (Securities Act Industry Guide 4)

_management and operating companies (in addition to the disclosure required by the appropriate registration form);


Registration Statements Relating to Interests in Real Estate Limited Partnerships (Securities Act Industry Guide
5)

_the persons making investment decisions (in addition to the disclosure required by the appropriate registration
form). 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


23

</FOOTNAME>
In order to simplify references to the legal proceedings disclosure requirements, references to Item 401(f) or 401(g)
hereafter should be read to include the comparable provisions in Regulation 
S-B Item 401(d). 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


24

</FOOTNAME>
In addition to provisions requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving designated persons, Regulation
S-K Item 103 [17 CFR 229.103] requires disclosure of material pending legal proceedings involving the registrant.



</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


25

</FOOTNAME>
Pub. L. 101&hyph;429, 104 Stat. 931 (1990). The Remedies Act amended the federal securities laws to provide for: civil
money penalties in civil actions for violations of the federal securities laws; Commission authority to issue cease-and-desist
orders; court enforcement of cease-and-desist orders and imposition of civil money penalties for failure to comply;
affirmation of power of federal courts to order officer and director bars and suspensions; and civil money penalties,
disgorgement, and orders of accounting in Commission administrative proceedings. Congress granted these new judicial
and administrative remedies to increase both the Commission's ability to deter those who violate the securities
laws and its flexibility to adapt remedies to the varying circumstances of particular conduct and violators. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The amendments proposed today would consolidate and clarify existing legal proceedings disclosure provisions,
as well as add requirements to disclose the following: 

&bull;Federal and state agency receivership appointments involving a designated person, any partnership in which
such person was a general partner, and any corporation in which such person served as an executive officer;

26

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


26

</FOOTNAME>
Current requirements limit disclosure to court-appointed receiverships. 

</FOOTNOTE>


&bull;All judicial and administrative findings, orders and sanctions based on alleged violations of federal or
state securities, commodities, banking and insurance laws and regulations;

27

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


27

</FOOTNAME>
Existing provisions require disclosure of court orders restricting certain business activities subject to federal
or state securities, commodities, banking and insurance laws, administrative restrictions on such activities
that exceed 60 days, and court limitations on any business practice. Disclosure also is required of judicial and administrative
findings of violations of federal or state securities or commodities laws.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-1-00007 </PARENT>

&bull;Civil and administrative proceedings resulting from a designated person's involvement in mail fraud, wire
fraud, and fraud in connection with activities related to a business entity;

28

 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


28

</FOOTNAME>
Disclosure of fraud-related legal proceedings currently is limited to criminal fraud actions and to the types of
proceedings listed in n.27, above, that involve fraud. 

</FOOTNOTE>


&bull;Civil and administrative actions relating to a designated person's breach of a fiduciary duty owed to a corporation,
partnership, business trust or similar entity;

29

 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


29

</FOOTNAME>
Disclosure currently is required if the breach of fiduciary duty resulted in one of the restrictions identified in
n.27, above. 

</FOOTNOTE>


&bull;Administrative orders restricting a designated person's business practices;

30

 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


30

</FOOTNAME>
Administrative restrictions on business practices currently must fall within one of the categories identified
in n.27, above, before disclosure is required. 

</FOOTNOTE>


&bull;Disciplinary sanctions imposed against a designated person by securities and commodities self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs''); and 
&bull;Comparable foreign legal proceedings.

31

 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


31

</FOOTNAME>
Current provisions do not distinguish between criminal and civil proceedings brought within the United States and
those pursued in foreign jurisdictions. The proposals would make it clear that disclosure is required of any foreign
criminal or civil proceeding if its domestic counterpart would be required to be disclosed and would add provisions
requiring disclosure of foreign administrative and bankruptcy actions. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Disclosure would be required for 10 years following the specified event, expanding the current five-year provision.

The proposals would rescind the general provisions that currently permit disclosure to be omitted if the registrant
believed that the information would be neither material to investors in evaluating the ability and integrity of management,
nor to a voting or investment decision; provisions relating to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, however, would
retain the materiality language. In addition, the provision limiting disclosure to administrative orders that
restrict activities for periods of more than 60 days would be deleted.

32

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


32

</FOOTNAME>
The provisions of paragraphs (f) and (g) of Regulation S-K Item 401 would be consolidated into a single paragraph (f).

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposals also conform the requirements in various forms and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. Finally, the Commission is proposing to add legal proceedings disclosure to investment company registration
statement forms. 


II. Background of Legal Proceedings Requirements
 


Disclosure of information regarding legal proceedings involving directors, executive officers, control persons,
promoters and others has been required in various filings under the federal securities laws for many years. In 1956,
the Commission adopted the current provisions requiring participants in proxy contests involving the election
or removal of directors to disclose criminal convictions (other than traffic violations or similar misdemeanors)
that occurred within the past 10 years.

33

 Since their adoption in 1968, large shareholder beneficial ownership reports

34

 also have required disclosure of criminal convictions with respect to the person or persons filing the report.

35

 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


33

</FOOTNAME>
Release No. 34&hyph;5276 (January 17, 1956) [21 FR 577]. This originally was adopted as a provision of Schedule 14B,
and a summary of this information was required to be furnished in election contest proxy statements. In October 1992,
the Commission eliminated the Schedule 14B filing requirement and moved the legal proceedings disclosure provision
from that Schedule into Item 5(b)(1)(iii) of Schedule 14A. 

See 

Release No. 34&hyph;31326 (October 16, 1992) [57 FR 48276]. That provision currently requires disclosure of any
criminal conviction of a ``participant'' in the election contest that has occurred in the last 10 years.

35

</FOOTNAME>
The ten year disclosure requirement originally found in the Schedule 13D was revised to a five-year requirement in
1977. Release No. 33&hyph;5808 (February 24, 1977) [42 FR 12342].

More than 20 years ago, the Commission began requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving directors in registration
statements and annual reports filed under the Exchange Act.

36

 In 1970, Exchange Act registration 
statements
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 and annual reports
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 were amended to require disclosure of the initiation of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, court appointments
of receivers, criminal convictions and pending criminal actions if these actions involved a director of the registrant
and were material to an evaluation of the director's ability and integrity. Disclosure also was required if a court
restricted activities involving the purchase or sale of securities or certain activities in the securities, commodities,
banking and insurance industries.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 In the administrative context, disclosure of similar restrictions was required if a suspension or bar exceeded 60
days. Disclosure was required if the action was taken within the past 10 years. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
36

</FOOTNAME>
In March 1969, the Commission's Disclosure Policy Study recommended increased disclosure of legal proceedings
involving management in Securities Act registration statements and Exchange Act registration statements, proxy
statements and annual reports.

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
Specifically, disclosure was required if the director had been restricted from acting as an investment adviser,
underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any investment company,
bank, savings and loan association or insurance company. Disclosure also was required if the court imposed any other
restriction on activities associated with the position. 
</FOOTNOTE>


In 1973, the legal proceedings disclosure provisions were expanded to include executive officers.

40

 Comparable requirements were added at that time to the general form for registration under the Securities Act

41

 and the registration form used for certain development stage companies.

</FOOTNAME>
Form S&hyph;1 [17 CFR 239.11]. At the same time, prospectuses relating to interests in oil and gas programs also were
required to include disclosure of legal proceedings involving management and operating companies, because the
Industry Guide applicable to such programs contained a provision requiring disclosure of the background information
called for by Form S&hyph;1 with respect to those persons. 

See 

Release No. 33&hyph;5036 (January 19, 1970) [35 FR 1233], adopting Guide 55, subsequently redesignated Guide 4 [17
CFR 229.801(d)]. In 1976, through the operation of a newly adopted Securities Act Industry Guide for registration
statements relating to interests in real estate limited partnerships, comparable disclosure was required in such
registration statements respecting individuals responsible for a partnership's investment decisions. 

See 

Release No. 33&hyph;5692 (March 17, 1976) [41 FR 17403], adopting Guide 60, subsequently redesignated Guide 5 [17
CFR 229.801(e)]. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


42

</FOOTNAME>
In 1973, the then Form S&hyph;2 was used for development stage companies (other than insurance, investment or mining
companies) that had not had any substantial gross returns from the sale of products or services, or any substantial
net income from any source, for any fiscal year ended during the past five years, had not succeeded to any business that
had such returns or net income, and did not have any subsidiaries (other than inactive subsidiaries with no more than
nominal assets). 

</FOOTNOTE>


In July 1978, the legal proceedings disclosure requirements for Securities Act registration statements, as well
as those in the Exchange Act registration statement and annual report, were consolidated into Regulation S&hyph;K,
and the individual provisions were replaced with references to the Regulation S&hyph;K Item.

43

 The disclosure requirements also were extended to real estate company registration statements and proxy and information
statements.

44

 The disclosure requirements were expanded at that time to include information relating to persons nominated to become
directors and to require disclosure of court orders imposing restrictions on any business practice, as well as injunctions
prohibiting future violations of federal or state securities laws.

45

 Disclosure of findings of securities law violations by a court or by the Commission also was added. Finally, the time
period for the disclosure was reduced from 10 to five years from the time the action was taken.

Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401 [17 CFR 229.401]; Release No. 33&hyph;5949 (July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402]. The disclosure
requirements originally were included in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 3 (Directors and executive officers), subsequently
redesignated Item 401. Release No. 33&hyph;6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


44

</FOOTNAME>
Provisions requiring the disclosure called for by Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401 were added to Form S&hyph;11 (for
registration of securities of real estate companies) [17 CFR 239.18] and the proxy statement requirements in Schedule
14A. This new provision did not replace the requirement to disclose criminal proceedings involving participants
in an election contest, discussed above in n.33, but rather, was included as an additional requirement. 

The amended proxy statement requirements also applied to information statements prepared in accordance with Schedule
14C [17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;101] of the Exchange Act, which incorporates many of the proxy statement requirements,
and to proxy statements under Rule 20a&hyph;1 of the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;1], which makes
the Schedule 14A disclosure requirements applicable to investment companies.

Subsequent to these changes, the Commission incorporated the Item 401(f) requirements into other disclosure documents.
In April 1980, the Commission amended Form S&hyph;8 (17 CFR 239.16b), for securities issued pursuant to employee
benefit plans, to require the incorporation by reference of the issuer's latest Exchange Act annual report, including
its legal proceedings disclosure, into the registration statement. Release No. 33&hyph;6202 (April 2, 1980) [45
FR 23653]. 
In March 1982, Securities Act Industry Guides 4 and 5 were amended to require the information specified in Regulation
S&hyph;K Item 401, replacing the reference to the requirements of Form S&hyph;1. Release No. 33&hyph;6384 (March
3, 1982) [47 FR 11476]. 

See 

n.41, above, and current Item 11 of Guide 4 and Item 9.A. of Guide 5. 
At that time, the Commission also adopted current Form S&hyph;2 [17 CFR 239.12], for registration under the Securities
Act of securities of certain issuers, and Form S&hyph;3 [17 CFR 239.13], for registration under the Securities Act
of securities of certain issuers offered pursuant to certain types of transactions. Release No. 33&hyph;6383 (March
3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. These forms incorporate by reference information required in the Form 10&hyph;K, including
the legal proceedings disclosure. 
In the same year, the Commission adopted Form S&hyph;18 [17 CFR 239.28] (optional registration form for small issuers)
Release No. 33&hyph;6406 (June 4, 1982) [47 FR 25126] and Form S&hyph;20 [17 CFR 239.20] (optional registration form
for standardized options), Release No. 33&hyph;6426 (September 16, 1982) [47 FR 41950]. Both forms required disclosure
of the legal proceedings specified in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401. Form S&hyph;18 was rescinded in connection with
the small business initiatives in 1992. Release No. 33&hyph;6949 (July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442]. For information relating
to the adoption of Form S&hyph;4 [17 CFR 239.25],

Specifically, Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401(f) was amended to require disclosure of judicial and administrative
restrictions on activities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), as well as court restrictions
on engaging in activities involving the purchase or sale of a commodity or the violation of federal commodities laws.
A provision requiring disclosure of findings of federal commodities law violations by courts or the CFTC also was
added.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The amendments added Item 401(g) [17 CFR 229.401(g)], which provided that registrants that have not been subject
to the reporting requirements of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) [15 U.S.C. 78m(a)] or 15(d) [15 U.S.C. 78o(d)] for the
12 months immediately prior to the filing of the registration statement, report or other document to which Item 401
is applicable, are required to disclose the Item 401(f) information with regard to control persons if the event occurred
within the past five years and was material to a voting or investment decision. In cases where such registrants were
organized within the past five years, the Item 401(f) disclosure is to be included with respect to promoters as well.


In April 1985, the Commission adopted Form S&hyph;4 (for registration of securities issued in business combination
transactions), which requires disclosure of the Item 401 information. Release No. 33&hyph;6578 (April 23, 1985)
[50 FR 18990]. 

</FOOTNOTE>


In 1992, the Commission adopted Regulation S&hyph;B as part of its small business initiatives, which included an
Item 401(d), governing legal proceedings disclosure, patterned on the requirements of Item 401 (f) and (g) of Regulation
S&hyph;K.

50

 This disclosure is required in connection with Securities Act registration statements on Form SB&hyph;2,

Other disclosure documents include legal proceedings disclosure requirements separate from those found in Regulation
S&hyph;K or Regulation S&hyph;B. Schedule 14D&hyph;1,

54

 the tender offer schedule adopted in 1977,

55

 requires disclosure if during the last five years the person filing the schedule was convicted in a criminal proceeding
(excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or was the subject of a judicial or administrative order
that enjoined future violations of, or prohibited activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or that
included findings of violations of those laws. In 1978, Schedule 13D was amended to include legal proceedings disclosure
provisions comparable to those included in Schedule 14D&hyph;1,

56

 and when Schedule 13E&hyph;3, for going private transactions,

57

 was adopted in 1979, the same disclosure was required.

58

 Unlike the Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401(f) requirements, disclosure is required of the enumerated proceedings
without regard to the filer's determination as to their materiality, and disclosure of administrative proceedings
is not limited to suspensions or bars exceeding 60 days.

III. Proposed Amendments 



The amendments proposed today would retain and clarify current legal proceedings disclosure requirements, expand
the scope of existing provisions, and lengthen the time period for which disclosure is required. With one exception,

61

 the proposals also would delete the provisions permitting a registrant to omit disclosure where it concludes that
the information would not be material to investors in evaluating the ability and integrity of management,

62

 or would not be material to a voting or investment decision.

63

 Consequently, under the proposals, like other line item disclosure requirements, information concerning legal
proceedings would be required if specified by the item.

</FOOTNAME>
Current Item 401(g) (1) and (2). The provisions of Item 401(g) requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving
promoters and control persons of newly public companies would be incorporated into proposed Item 401(f). 

See 

proposed Item 401(f)(2). 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


64

</FOOTNAME>
Current Instruction 2 to Item 401(f), which states that registrants may voluntarily advise the staff that the disclosure
was not required based on a determination that it is not material to an investment or voting decision, would be inapplicable
to most disclosure requirements. The substance of the instruction would be moved to a note to the bankruptcy provisions
found in proposed Item 401(f)(1)(i). 

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed amendments would require disclosure of any identified legal proceeding unless it was subsequently
reversed, suspended, vacated, annulled or otherwise rendered of no effect,

65

 and would codify the current staff interpretation that disclosure is not required if a conviction is reversed. The
proposals also would make it clear that disclosure is required while a legal proceeding is pending appeal.

66

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


65

</FOOTNAME>


See 

proposed Item 401(f)(1), representing a consolidation of similar provisions found in paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and
(6) of current Item 401(f). 

Under current and proposed rules, an order or sanction need not be disclosed if it has been reversed or otherwise set
aside on the basis of the underlying law or facts. However, a registrant must disclose a permanent injunction involving
a designated person during the entire disclosure period even if equitable relief from the injunction has been granted
before the close of such period. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


66

</FOOTNAME>
Instruction 1 to Item 401(f) would be amended to indicate that disclosure of final convictions, orders, judgments,
decrees or sanctions is required from the date of entry. If appealed, disclosure would continue to be required. If
ultimately reversed, suspended, vacated, annulled or otherwise rendered of no effect, disclosure no longer would
be required. Disclosure of preliminary orders, judgments, decrees and sanctions would be required from the date
that any right to appeal the preliminary action expired. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Currently, it is the practice to disclose legal proceedings background information for each general partner of a
partnership and each trustee of a real estate investment trust. A new instruction would be added to codify this practice
and to expand the requirement to provide such disclosure with respect to trustees of any registrant that is a trust,
as well as any other persons providing comparable services to such entities. Disclosure also would be required relating
to any person who performs, either directly or indirectly, director or executive officer functions pursuant to a
management contract, service contract, such as those used by asset-backed pools, or otherwise.

While specific requests for comment are made throughout with respect to the proposals discussed in detail below,
commenters are requested to comment generally on the need for revision of the legal proceedings disclosure requirements.
Is the approach proposed adequate to address investor concerns about the background of those who direct the affairs
of public companies, or would some other method be more effective? 



A. Disclosure of Judicial and Administrative Proceedings 



1. Bankruptcy and Insolvency Proceedings 



The current provision requiring disclosure of the court appointment of a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer
with respect to a business in which a designated person served as an executive officer would be expanded to include
a similar appointment made by a federal or state agency.

68

 For example, disclosure would be required where a state insurance commissioner appointed a conservator to take control
of the business and assets of an insurance company for which a designated person had served as an executive officer
within two years prior to such appointment.

69

 Disclosure also would be required of the appointment by a bank regulatory authority of a receiver or conservator to
operate, sell or liquidate a financial institution.

69

</FOOTNAME>


See, e.g.,

 Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;20&hyph;169 (authorizing the director of insurance to take possession of, or to appoint
a conservator for, an insolvent insurance company); Texas Insurance Code Ann. &sect;21.28A (authorizing the commissioner
of insurance to undertake supervision of or to appoint a conservator for, an insolvent insurance company). 

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


70

</FOOTNAME>


See, e.g.,

 Section 203 of the Bank Conservation Act [12 U.S.C. 203] (authorizing the Comptroller of the Currency of the United
States to appoint a conservator for a national bank), and Cal. Financial Code &sect;8250 (authorizing the California
Savings and Loan Commissioner to appoint a receiver for a savings and loan association). 

As used in this release, ``financial institution'' means any bank, bank holding company, savings association, or
savings and loan holding company, as defined in Section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1813], any
federal or state credit union, as defined in Section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act [12 U.S.C. 1752], or any system
institution of the Farm Credit System, as defined in Section 5.35 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 [12 U.S.C. 2271], or
any substantially equivalent foreign institution. 

See

 proposed Instruction 3 of Item 401(f). 

</FOOTNOTE>


While in most instances the provisions allowing registrants to omit disclosure of legal actions based on their materiality
would be eliminated under the proposals, as discussed elsewhere in this release,

71

 the Commission proposes to retain a provision permitting filers to weigh the materiality of bankruptcy and insolvency
proceedings involving designated persons prior to disclosure.

72

 Unlike the other legal proceedings to be disclosed under Item 401, bankruptcy proceedings include proceedings as
to which the designated person's responsibility could vary considerably. Comment is solicited as to whether this
materiality provision should be retained with respect to bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, as proposed, or
whether such actions should be disclosed without exception. 



<FOOTNOTE>

 Section III.A, above, and Section III.E, below. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


72

</FOOTNAME>
Proposed Item 401(f)(1)(i). 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also solicits commenters' views on whether the current provisions should be expanded to require disclosure
where the designated person served as a director of a company within two years before the initiation of bankruptcy
or insolvency proceedings or the appointment of a receiver or conservator with respect to that company. Currently,
disclosure is required only if the person was an executive officer of the entity. Commenters should identify the reasons
for or against such an expansion.

Further, comment is sought as to whether the current provision requiring disclosure where the designated person
served as an executive officer within two years of the identified bankruptcy or insolvency actions should be retained,
as proposed, or whether the two-year time period should be shortened or lengthened, for example, to one year, or three
or five years. Commenters also should address whether disclosure should be required where a designated person was
an executive officer of a financial institution whose operation or sale is supervised by an administrative authority
in the absence of the formal appointment of a receiver or conservator.

73

operate or liquidate a banking organization). 

</FOOTNOTE>


2. Criminal Proceedings



Like the current Item, the proposals would require disclosure where a designated person was convicted in a criminal
proceeding or was the named subject of a pending criminal action (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses).

74

 However, the proposal clarifies that the Item requires disclosure of a criminal conviction resulting from a designated
person's entry of a plea of nolo contendere. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


74

</FOOTNAME>
Current Item 401(f)(2) and proposed Item 401(f)(1)(ii). 

</FOOTNOTE>


3. Civil and Administrative Proceedings 



a. 

Money penalty consent decrees and other orders or sanctions.

 Disclosure concerning civil and administrative proceedings involving designated persons now is limited to judicial
orders restricting specified business activities,

75

 administrative orders restricting such activities for more than 60 days,

76

 and judicial or administrative findings of securities or commodities law violations.

77

 As proposed, any judicial or administrative finding, order or sanction relating to violations of federal and state
securities and commodities laws and regulations, or laws and regulations respecting financial institutions or
insurance companies, would trigger disclosure.

78

 The exemption from disclosure of administrative proceedings that impose restrictions for periods of less than 60
days would be eliminated. Comment is solicited as to whether this exemption should be retained, but with a shorter
time period, such as 20, 10 or five days.

As a result of the proposed amendments, disclosure would be required of any order or sanction resulting from proceedings
brought under the federal securities laws, including court-imposed civil money penalties and judicial orders temporarily
barring an individual from serving as an officer or director of a public company, as authorized by the Remedies Act.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 Disclosure of such orders or sanctions would be required, whether or not the court makes a finding that securities
laws were violated.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


80

</FOOTNAME>
While courts may issue orders upon a proper showing without finding securities law violations, all administrative
orders issued by the Commission contain findings of a violation or violations of securities laws and regulations,
even when the order is the result of a settlement agreement. Consequently, disclosure of all orders or sanctions issued
by the Commission, such as cease-and-desist orders, pursuant to the enforcement provisions added by the Remedies
Act would be required under both current and proposed provisions. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Similarly, disclosure explicitly would be required of any judicial or administrative finding, order or sanction
issued or imposed against the designated person under the enforcement provisions of the federal laws and regulations
governing financial institutions, as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
of 1989 (``FIRREA''),
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
 as well as under similar state statutes and regulations.
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 For example, the proposed disclosure requirements would reach a civil money penalty imposed pursuant to a settlement
agreement between a designated person and a bank regulator, where the final order neither included findings of violations
of the law nor imposed any limitation on that person's acting in any capacity related to banks or savings and loan associations.

</FOOTNOTE>


b. 

Fraud in connection with a financial institution, insurance company, or other business entity.

 The proposals would expand current provisions by requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving alleged violations
by a designated person of any law or regulation prohibiting fraud in connection with a financial institution, insurance
company or other business entity. Disclosure of legal proceedings involving fraud currently is limited to criminal
fraud proceedings, civil and administrative actions involving fraud in connection with violations of securities
or commodities laws, and orders restricting the designated person from acting as a director, employee or affiliated
person of a bank, savings and loan association or insurance company or from engaging in related activities based on
that person's fraudulent conduct. Consequently, in addition to the actions for which disclosure is currently required,
the proposals would require disclosure of a court order enjoining the designated person from knowingly defrauding
a financial institution, whether or not the court imposed restrictions on the person's future business relationship
with the institution.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 Another example of required disclosure would be a court judgment against a designated person for violating consumer
fraud statutes in connection with that person's business.

c. Civil mail and wire fraud

. The proposals also would require disclosure of civil and administrative proceedings relating to mail and wire fraud.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, for example, court orders enjoining violations of mail or wire fraud statutes,

86

 as well as U.S. Postal Service orders requiring a designated person to cease and desist from conducting a scheme or
device for obtaining money or property through the mail by false representations,

87

 would be disclosed.

1343, providing criminal penalties for schemes and artifices to defraud by means of wire, radio or television]; however,

obligations owed to corporations, partnerships, business trusts and similar business entities.

88

 If, for example, a designated person was subject to a court order resulting from a breach of a fiduciary duty imposed
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''),

89

 or had been found to have breached a fiduciary duty as a director of a corporation, in violation of state corporation
or common law, disclosure would be required.

Proposed Item 401(f)(1)(iii)(A)(

). One type of a ``similar business entity'' under the proposed rule is a limited liability company, which strictly
speaking is neither a corporation nor a partnership, but has characteristics of both. 

See 

Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;18&hyph;101 

et seq.

duties imposed by ERISA). 

</FOOTNOTE>


e. 

Restrictions on any business practice

. The current provision requiring disclosure where a court enjoins or otherwise limits the designated person from
engaging in any business practice

90

 would be expanded to require disclosure of similar orders issued by administrative authorities.

91

 Under the proposals, for example, Federal Communications Commission orders requiring a designated person to cease
and desist from engaging in activities that violate regulations governing telecommunications,

92

 International Trade Commission orders restricting such person from engaging in unfair practices in the importation
of articles into the United States,

93

 Federal Trade Commission orders requiring the person to cease and desist from engaging in unfair methods of competition,

94

 and other similar federal or state administrative actions would be required to be disclosed.

f. 

Request for comment concerning civil and administrative proceedings

. The proposed provisions discussed above relating to civil and administrative proceedings require disclosure
if a finding, order or sanction relates to an alleged violation by a designated person of securities, commodities,
banking and insurance laws and regulations and other designated laws and regulations, as well as orders restricting
a designated person from engaging in any business practice. Comment is requested as to whether the requirement to
disclose restrictions on any business practice is sufficient to apprise investors of the backgrounds of those who
direct the affairs of public companies. 

Comment also is sought as to whether disclosure relating to violations of laws governing corporations, partnerships
or other entities should be restricted to violations of a fiduciary duty provision, as proposed, or restricted further
to violations of a fiduciary duty involving fraud. Commenters also are requested to address whether those proposals
should be expanded to require disclosure of findings, orders and sanctions entered in proceedings involving alleged
violations of any laws respecting such business entities. Finally, comment is requested as to whether there is any
category of civil or administrative proceeding that should be excluded from the disclosure requirements and the
reason for the recommended exclusion.

B. 

Disclosure of Disciplinary Actions by Self-Regulatory Organizations 



Under the proposals, a requirement would be added to describe disciplinary sanctions imposed by any securities or
commodities industry self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') that oversees the business conduct and sales practices
of its members.

95

 The Commission requests comment as to whether there are any classes of SRO disciplinary proceedings that should be
excluded, such as summary proceedings by an SRO wherein the designated person is fined not more than $2500 for minor
or technical violations of the SRO's rules and procedures.

96

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


95

</FOOTNAME>
Proposed Item 401(f)(1)(iv). Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)] defines self-regulatory
organization as any national securities exchange registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78f] (

e.g.

, the New York Stock Exchange), any securities association registered under Section 15A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
78o&hyph;3] (

e.g.

, the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'')), and any clearing agency registered under Section
17A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1] (

e.g.

, the National Securities Clearing Corporation). The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') also falls
within the statutory definition of a self-regulatory organization, but the MSRB refers all disciplinary actions
to the NASD. 

Regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 

et seq

.] define self-regulatory organization as contract markets registered under Section 5 of the Commodity Exchange
Act [7 U.S.C. 7] (

e.g.

, the Chicago Board of Trade) and futures associations registered under Section 17 [7 U.S.C. 21] of that Act (

e.g.

, the National Futures Association). 17 CFR 1.3(ee). Clearing organizations, as defined in 17 CFR 1.3(d) (

e.g.

, the Commodity Clearing Corporation), also are included in the definition of self-regulatory organization found
in 17 CFR 1.59(a)(1). 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


96

</FOOTNAME>
Such proceedings would include action taken pursuant to an SRO minor rule violation plan or similar plan. 

See 

Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2) [17 CFR 240.19d&hyph;1(c)(2)]. 

</FOOTNOTE>


C. Disclosure of Comparable Foreign Legal Proceedings 



While current provisions relating to disclosure of a designated person's involvement in criminal and civil actions
do not distinguish between foreign legal actions and those taken within the United States, the proposed amendments
explicitly would require disclosure of foreign criminal convictions and civil proceedings before foreign courts.
Moreover, provisions would be added requiring disclosure of actions by foreign administrative authorities. Thus,
disclosure would be required of any foreign legal proceeding that is comparable to a domestic legal proceeding requiring
disclosure. 

These proposals reflect the ever-increasing international character of financial transactions and the important
role played by foreign authorities in assuring safe and efficient financial markets world-wide.

97

 Comment is requested as to whether there are any other types of legal proceedings before foreign authorities that
should be specifically required, as well as whether any foreign legal proceedings should be excluded from the disclosure
requirements. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA'') [Sections 201&hyph;207 of the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;550, 104 Stat. 2713 (1990)] granted the Commission the authority to
sanction regulated entities and associated persons if they have been convicted of certain crimes by a foreign court
of competent jurisdiction within 10 years of filing an application with the Commission, or have been found by a foreign
financial regulatory authority to have violated laws and regulations that are substantially equivalent to federal
securities and commodities laws. 

See 

Sections 203 and 205 of ISECA, amending Section 15(b) (4) and (6) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78o(b) (4) and (6)],
Section 9(b)(4) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;9(b)(4)], and Section 203(e)(7) of the Investment
Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. 80b&hyph;3(e)(7)]. 

</FOOTNOTE>


D. Other Legal Proceedings 



1. Arbitration Proceedings 



While not specifically included in the amendments proposed today, the Commission requests comment on whether disclosure
should be required concerning the results of arbitration proceedings arising out of allegations of violations of
securities or commodities laws and regulations, or breaches of the laws and regulations relating to other commercial
transactions. Given the widespread use of arbitration clauses, as well as statutes and court rules that require or
permit claims to be submitted to arbitration rather than to courts, investors may consider information regarding
a designated person's involvement in arbitration proceedings material to their investment decisions. 

The Commission invites comment on whether disclosure should be required concerning arbitration awards where the
action would have been disclosed had the claim been pursued before a court, administrative body or SRO. In addition,
commenters should address whether there are other types of alternative dispute resolution that should trigger disclosure.
Comment also is requested as to whether there are any arbitration proceedings that should be exempt from disclosure
in light of the nature of the issues involved or the insignificant dollar amount of the award. Finally, comment is solicited
as to whether there should be dollar amount thresholds that govern disclosure and whether such thresholds should
be cumulative figures based on multiple arbitration awards.

2. Rule 2(e) Proceedings 



The Commission also solicits comment as to whether filers should be required to disclose all administrative actions
brought by the Commission against a designated person pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 Rule 2(e) provides for the suspension or disbarment of certain professionals, usually attorneys and accountants,
from practicing before the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>
 Where Rule 2(e) orders relate to violations of the federal securities laws,
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 disclosure would be required under both the current and proposed rules. Should the requirements be expanded to encompass
Rule 2(e) orders based on lack of professional qualifications,
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 lack of character or integrity, or unethical or improper professional misconduct,
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 the conviction of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or the disbarment or revocation of a license
to practice as an attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert?
<FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>
 If not, commenters should provide specific reasons for any recommended exclusions. If it is determined that all Rule
2(e) orders should be disclosed, should disclosure of disciplinary sanctions imposed by other federal and state
authorities or non-government professional associations, such as bar associations, for violations of standards
of professional conduct also be required?

E. Disclosure Period Expansion to 10 Years 



The Commission proposes to expand the time during which disclosure is required from five to 10 years,
<FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>
 and to delete in most instances the provisions allowing registrants to omit information they determine is neither
material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of the designated person
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 nor to a voting or investment decision.
<FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>
 Based on its experience since 1978, when the original disclosure period was reduced from 10 to the current five years,
<FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission believes that many legal proceedings remain material beyond five years.
<FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, the inclusion of the information would continue to be required beyond 10 years where necessary to render
statements otherwise made in the registration statement, report or document not misleading.

Rule 408 [17 CFR 230.408] under the Securities Act, Rule 12b&hyph;20 [17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;20] under the Exchange
Act, and Rule 8b&hyph;20 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.8b&hyph;20] require registrants to disclose,
in addition to the information expressly required to be included in a registration statement or report, any further
material information as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. 

Cf.

 Releases No. 33&hyph;5758 (November 2, 1976) [41 FR 49493] and No. 33&hyph;5949 (July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402] stating
that information regarding events occurring outside the five-year period may be material and should be disclosed.
For examples of civil actions finding legal proceedings over five years old to be material, 

see SEC v. Scott

, 565 F.Supp. 1513 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (prospectus deemed materially false and misleading, in part because 1961 Canadian
fraud conviction not disclosed in 1980 prospectus); 

Bertoglio v. Texas Int'l Co.

, 488 F.Supp. 630 (D. Del. 1980) (1964 Commission bar should have been disclosed in 1979 proxy materials notwithstanding
five-year disclosure requirement).

securities law violations occurring in 1977 and 1979 deemed material and discoverable notwithstanding Item 401(f)
five-year provisions). 

</FOOTNOTE>


Since some types of legal proceedings may have a greater impact on voting and investment decisions than others, the
Commission requests comment as to whether there are specific actions that should be disclosed for periods less than
10 years. For example, should misdemeanors be described for a lesser period than felony convictions? Commenters
favoring that approach should specify the types of proceedings to which the current five-year provision should continue
to apply. On the other hand, disclosure may be appropriate for periods longer than 10 years with respect to certain
types of legal proceedings_for example: criminal fraud convictions; civil, administrative and SRO actions based
on fraud involving securities, commodities, financial institutions, insurance companies or other businesses;
actions involving mail and wire fraud; and, proceedings resulting in the removal or bar from acting in a decision-making
capacity in connection with a financial institution or other business. Should these types of legal proceedings be
disclosed for longer periods, such as 15 or 20 years, or indefinitely? Should disclosure be required so long as the
designated person is subject to the order? Commenters should provide an analysis in support of any specific time period
recommended.

Many legal proceedings based on violations of federal, state or other laws or rules or SRO rules result in orders or
sanctions that remain in place for indefinite periods. For example, many injunctions, cease-and-desist orders
and industry bars are imposed permanently and remain in force until further judicial or administrative action is
taken to vacate the order.
<FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>
 Should the current five-year disclosure period be maintained, with the exception that any injunction, cease-and-desist
order, industry bar or other continuing order or bar would be required to be disclosed for as long as the designated
person is subject to the order or sanction, even when the order or sanction was imposed more than five years ago? Would
that have the effect of providing sufficient disclosure of the conduct most relevant to investors' voting decisions?
If such a provision were adopted, would it be appropriate to provide some outer limit (such as 10 or 15 years) after which
disclosure could be discontinued?

F. Form and Schedule Amendments 



As outlined above,
<FOOTCITE>111</FOOTCITE>
 legal proceedings disclosure requirements vary among certain forms and schedules. The Commission proposes to amend
the requirements found in Schedules 13D, 13E&hyph;3, 14A
<FOOTCITE>112</FOOTCITE>
 and 14D&hyph;1 and the Regulation A offering circular (Model B) to conform with those of Regulation S&hyph;K Item
401.
<FOOTCITE>113</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission solicits comment as to whether any schedule or form identified above should not be conformed with proposed
legal proceedings requirements, and requests that commenters provide the specific rationale for any exclusion
recommended.

This proposed change would only affect disclosure relating to participants in election contests, which currently
requires disclosure only of criminal convictions within the past 10 years. 

See

 current Item 5(b)(1)(iii) of Schedule 14A. Of course, all proxy statements involving the election of directors would
be affected by the rule proposals generally because Item 7(b) requires that the information specified in Item 401
be included with respect to directors, officers and director nominees.

The changes to these forms and schedules are found in proposed Item 2(d) of Schedule 13D; proposed Item 2(e) of Schedule

</FOOTNOTE>


As discussed above, the Item, forms and schedules identify persons for whom the legal proceedings disclosure is required;
<FOOTCITE>114</FOOTCITE>
 the proposed amendments would specify that disclosure is required where the function performed by a designated person
is performed by others, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a management or service contract, or otherwise.
<FOOTCITE>115</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is requested as to whether there is any class of persons not currently subject to legal proceedings disclosure
that should be. For example, should disclosure relating to promoters or control persons be required beyond the current
12 month period following an initial public offering, thus requiring disclosure in Exchange Act annual reports?
Is there any class of persons currently identified as designated persons that should not be? Should the Regulation
S&hyph;K Item 401 provisions be expanded to require disclosure relating to persons participating in the offering
of a penny stock if the disclosure document is furnished in connection with such an offering?

IV. Investment Company Act Disclosure



The Commission is proposing to add legal proceedings disclosure, as proposed to be amended, to investment company
registration statement forms and to expand the scope of legal proceedings disclosure in proxy statements. Currently,
legal proceedings disclosure is specifically required only in investment company proxy statements related to the
election of directors.

118

 Investment Company Act disclosure documents are intended, among other things, to inform investors and investment
company shareholders about matters that concern the background and qualifications of those persons who oversee
(such as directors) or manage (such as investment advisers) an investment company and its assets. The Commission
believes that disclosure of information concerning legal proceedings may be material to investors and shareholders
and is, therefore, proposing to require this disclosure in investment company disclosure documents. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


118

</FOOTNAME>
Item 22(b)(4) of Schedule 14A. Prior to the recent amendments to the proxy rules applicable to investment companies,
which consolidated the disclosure requirements in Item 22 of Schedule 14A (Release No. IC&hyph;20614 (October 13,
1994) [59 FR 52689]), Rule 20a&hyph;1 under the Investment Company Act required legal proceedings disclosure by
reference to Item 7 of Schedule 14A. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed amendments would require Item 401(f) disclosure in investment company prospectuses.

119

 Because most investment companies are externally managed by investment advisers, the Commission also is proposing
to require disclosure concerning not only directors and officers of the investment company, but also ``managerial
persons'' of the investment adviser.

120

 For the purposes of the legal proceedings disclosure, ``managerial persons'' would mean ``affiliated persons''
of the investment adviser as that term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act

121

 who are engaged in the management, direction, supervision, or performance of any activities related to the investment
company.

122

 This definition would include, for example, officers or employees of the investment adviser whose duties are related
to the management of an investment company.

123

 On the other hand, the definition is not intended to require disclosure with respect to persons affiliated with the
investment adviser who have no managerial or similar responsibilities with respect to the investment company.

124

 The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed definition of ``managerial persons'' will result in appropriate
disclosure that will provide material information to investment company investors and shareholders.

125

 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


119

</FOOTNAME>
Proposed amendments to: Item 5 of Form N&hyph;1A (open-end investment companies); Item 9 of Form N&hyph;2 (closed-end
investment companies) Item 6 of Form N&hyph;3 (separate accounts that offer variable annuity contracts that are
registered under the Investment Company Act); Form N&hyph;4 (separate accounts that offer variable annuity contracts
which are registered under the Investment Company Act as unit investment trusts); Items 11, 12, and 16 of Form N&hyph;5
(small business investment companies); Item 28 of Form N&hyph;8B&hyph;2 (unit investment trusts); Items 26, 27,
and 28 of Form N&hyph;8B&hyph;3 (investment companies issuing periodic payment plan certificates); Items 29 and
34 of Form N&hyph;8B&hyph;4 (face amount certificate companies). 

The Commission also is proposing amendments to Schedules A and B of Regulation E [17 CFR 230.610a] under the Securities
Act which would require offering circulars used by small business investment companies and business development
companies relying on the Regulation E exemption to include the information specified in proposed Item 401(f) as to
each director, executive officer and advisory board member of the issuer and as to managerial persons of the investment
adviser of the issuer. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


120

</FOOTNAME>
In the case of an investment company registered as a separate account on Forms N&hyph;3, N&hyph;4 or N&hyph;8B&hyph;2,
disclosure would be required of legal proceedings involving the directors, officers and employees of the sponsoring
insurance company, or its affiliates, who participate directly in the management or administration of the separate
account. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


121

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;2(a)(3). An affiliated person is: (i) a person who directly or indirectly owns or controls more
than 5% of the voting securities of a person; (ii) a person of which more than 5% of the voting securities is owned or controlled
by a person; (iii) a person that is controlled, controlled by, or under common control with, a person; (iv) any officer,
director, partner, or employees of a person; (v) if such person is an investment company, the investment adviser or
any member of the advisory board thereof; and (vi) if the person is an unincorporated investment company without a
board of directors, the depositor thereof.

The term ``managerial persons'' is similar to, but not the same as, the term ``management person'' used in Rule 206(4)&hyph;4
under the Investment Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.206(4)&hyph;4]. Rule 206(4)&hyph;4 requires investment advisers
to disclose to their clients certain financial and disciplinary information about the investment adviser or a management
person of the adviser. For purposes of Rule 206(4)&hyph;4, a management person is defined as a person who controls
the adviser or determines the general investment advice given to clients.

For a large company with investment advisory services and other types of businesses, monitoring and reporting legal
proceedings about all persons affiliated with the company could be costly and result in lengthy disclosure.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


125

</FOOTNAME>
The proposed legal proceeding disclosure would require information concerning persons, otherwise barred under
section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;9(a)], who have been permitted by the Commission under
section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;9(c)] to be associated with an investment company.


</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also is proposing to conform the legal proceedings disclosure in proxy statements to the registration
statement forms, as proposed to be amended. The proposed disclosure in proxy statements for officers and directors
of the investment company and managerial persons of the investment adviser would be required 

both 

in connection with the election of directors, as currently required, and in proxy statements seeking approval of
an investment advisory contract.

126

 Legal proceedings disclosure may be as relevant to a shareholder's assessment of an investment advisory contract
as it is to the election of directors.

VI. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



To assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposed changes to disclosure
requirements contained in this release, commenters are requested to provide views and data relating to any costs
and benefits associated with these proposals. It is expected that the enhanced legal proceeding disclosure provisions
will modestly increase most registrants' costs and compliance burdens. A requirement to provide additional information
for longer periods of time than currently required in documents filed under the Securities Act, Exchange Act and Investment
Company Act should not significantly increase the burden on company resources, since many registrants and others
already are required to gather information regarding the backgrounds of directors, officers and others. It appears,
however, that any additional expense may be justified in view of the material information that would be made available
to investors. 



VII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed
amendments to Item 401 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, the Regulation A offering circular (Model B), Schedules
13D, 13E&hyph;3, 14A and 14D&hyph;1, Forms N&hyph;1A, N&hyph;2, N&hyph;3, N&hyph;4, N&hyph;5, N&hyph;8B&hyph;2,
N&hyph;8B&hyph;3 and N&hyph;8B&hyph;4, and Regulation E. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended
to provide investors with more information regarding the background of those who exercise control over the affairs
of public companies. 

As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes would affect persons that are small entities, as defined
by the Commission's rules. It is expected that increased reporting, recordkeeping and compliance burdens would
result from the changes. The analysis also indicates that there are no current federal rules that duplicate, overlap
or conflict with the revised legal proceedings disclosure provisions. 

As stated in the analysis, several possible significant alternatives to the proposals were considered, including,
among others, establishing different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them
from all or part of the proposed requirements. As more fully discussed in the analysis, the alternatives were either
addressed in the proposals, inconsistent with the purposes of the federal securities laws, or otherwise without
justification. 

Written comments are encouraged with respect to any aspect of the analysis. Such comments will be considered in the
preparation of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposed revisions are adopted. A copy of the analysis
may be obtained by contacting James R. Budge, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202)
942&hyph;2910, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549&hyph;6009.




VIII. Statutory Basis for Rules and Forms 



The Commission is proposing amendments to Item 401 of Regulations S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B, Regulation A and Regulation
E pursuant to Sections 3(b), 6, 7, 8, 10, and 19 of the Securities Act. Other amendments to Item 401 and amendments to
Schedules 13D, 13E&hyph;3, 14A and 14D&hyph;1 are proposed pursuant to Sections 12, 13, 14, 15(d) and 23 of the Exchange
Act. The Commission also is proposing amendments to the proxy rules applicable to investment companies and to investment
company registration statement forms pursuant to Sections 8(b), 20(a) and 38(a) of the Investment Company Act.

The transportation conformity final rule entitled ``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Conformity to State
or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Funded or Approved Under title
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act,'' was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). This action was required under 
section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990.
The transportation conformity rule requires each ozone nonattainment area and maintenance area to perform a regional
analysis of motor vehicle volatile organic compound and NO

X

 emissions from any planned transportation project. This analysis must demonstrate that the emissions which would
result from the proposed transportation system, if the transportation plan were implemented, are within the total
allowable level of emissions described in the motor vehicle emissions budget. 
Until an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan is approved by the EPA, this emissions analysis must pass the
build/no-build test. This analysis must demonstrate that the emissions from the planned transportation project,
if implemented, would be less than the emissions without the planned transportation project. Thus, the build/no-build
test is intended to ensure that the transportation plan contributes to annual emissions reductions consistent with
the CAA until such 
time as the attainment demonstration or maintenance plan is approved. For further information concerning the Federal
transportation conformity requirements, see 40 CFR part 51, subpart T and 40 CFR part 93, subpart A. 



Transportation Conformity and Section 182(f) Exemptions 



On June 17, 1994, the EPA published a national interpretation of transportation conformity and Section 182(f) exemptions
entitled ``Transportation Conformity; General Preamble for Exemption From Nitrogen Oxides Provisions'' (59 FR
31238) (General Preamble). This General Preamble clarifies and interprets how ozone nonattainment areas classified
as less than marginal, which have air quality monitoring data demonstrating attainment of the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, may be exempted from certain NO

X

 requirements. 
As discussed in the General Preamble, both the transportation conformity rule and CAA section 182(f)(1)(A) state
that NO

X

 requirements shall not apply in nonattainment areas if the Administrator determines that additional reductions
of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the area. The EPA also issued two guidance documents on

section 182(f) exemptions. These two documents, ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitting
Requests for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide (CO) NAAQS on or after November 15, 1992''
dated September 17, 1993, and ``Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxide Requirements under

Section 182(f)'' dated December 1993, state that if an area has attained the ozone standard, additional NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment. 
As explained in the General Preamble, the EPA believes that a demonstration of attainment made through adequate air
quality monitoring data, consistent with 40 CFR part 58 and recorded in the EPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval
System (AIRS), can qualify an area as a ``clean data area''. Further, the EPA believes these ``clean data areas'' can
request an exemption from the NO

X

 provisions of transportation conformity. The 
section 182(f) exemption will be conditioned upon the area's monitoring data continuing to demonstrate attainment
after an exemption is granted. If the EPA determines that an exempted area has violated the ozone standard, the section
182(f) exemption will be rescinded. Any decision to rescind the NO

X

 exemption would be based on an evaluation of the air quality data recorded in AIRS. Past conformity determinations
and transportation plans would not be affected, but new conformity determinations would be subject to the NO

X

 provisions of the conformity rule.

Analysis of State Submittal 


The State of Louisiana has ten parishes designated as nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas. Nonclassifiable
ozone nonattainment areas had air quality data which demonstrated attainment of the ozone standard, but had not petitioned
the EPA for redesignation to attainment before the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) were passed. These parishes were
nonattainment prior to the 1990 CAAA, and retained their ozone nonattainment designations with the passage of the
CAAA. Transitional areas possessed the required three years of air quality data, while incomplete data areas had
less than the required three years of data. 
Beauregard, Grant, Lafourche, St. James and St. Mary Parishes were classified as incomplete data areas for ozone
on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694). The New Orleans Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area contained four parishes
which were designated as transitional ozone nonattainment areas on November 6, 1991: Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard
and 
St. Charles. Lafayette Parish was also classified as a transitional ozone nonattainment area on November 6, 1991.

On August 5, 1994, the State of Louisiana submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the ten parishes listed above
be exempted from the requirement to perform the NO

X

 portion of the build/no-build test required by the new transportation conformity rule. This exemption request is
pursuant to the recently published General Preamble for transportation conformity NO

X

 exemptions. 
The exemption request was based on air monitoring data which demonstrated that the NAAQS for ozone was attained in
each of these nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas for the three years prior to the petition. The Air quality
data was verified as quality assured in accordance with monitoring requirements specified in 40 CFR part 58, and demonstrates
that the ozone standard has been maintained in these areas. 


Proposed Rulemaking Action 


The EPA has evaluated the State's exemption request for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy.
The EPA believes that the exemption request and monitoring data qualifies the parishes of Beauregard, Grant, Lafayette,
Lafourche, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles, 
St. James, and St. Mary as ``clean data areas''. In addition, the EPA has determined that the exemption request meets
the requirements and policy set forth in the General Preamble for NO

X

 exemptions from the build/no-build test for transportation conformity, and today is proposing approval of Louisiana's
request for exemption from the NO

X

 build/no-build test of transportation conformity for these parishes. The section 182(f) exemption will be conditioned
upon the area's monitoring data continuing to demonstrate attainment after the exemption has been granted. If the
EPA later determines that any of these parishes has violated the ozone standard, the section 182(f) exemption will
be rescinded for that parish. Past conformity determinations and transportation plans would not be affected, but
new conformity determinations would then be subject to the NO

X

 provisions of the conformity rule. 
The EPA has reviewed this request for exemption from the NO

X

 provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 CAAA enacted
on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. 


Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 


et seq

., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, under 
5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities (see 46 FR 8709). Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and governmental
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
Because an exemption from the Federal transportation conformity rule does not impose any new requirements, I certify
that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State
relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry
into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such
grounds (Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2)).

This is a synopsis of the Commission's 

Notice of Proposed Rule Making,

 MM Docket No. 94&hyph;123, adopted October 20, 1994, and released October 25, 1994. The complete text of this document
is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919
M Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20554, and may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International

Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. The Commission initiated a rulemaking proceeding to assess, in light of current economic and technological conditions,
the legal and policy justifications for the Prime Time Access Rule (``PTAR''), Section 73.658(k) of the Commission's
Rules, and to consider the continued need for the rule in its current form. The rule generally prohibits network-affiliated
stations in the top 50 television markets from broadcasting more than three hours of network or former network (``off-network'')
programs during the four prime time viewing hours (

i.e.,

 7 to 11 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times; 6 to 11 p.m. Central and Mountain times). The rule also contains exemptions for
certain types of programming (

e.g.,

 special news, documentary, children's and sports programming).

2. PTAR was initially promulgated in 1970 in response to the concern that the three major television networks_ABC,
CBS and NBC_dominated the program production market, controlled much of the video fare presented to the public, and
inhibited the development of competing program sources. The Commission believed that PTAR would increase the level
of competition in the independent production of programs, reduce the networks' control over their affiliates' programming
decisions, and increase the diversity of programs available to the public.

3. The Commission believes that as the video marketplace has developed and the major networks' power has declined
in the years since PTAR was established, an overall review of the rule is now appropriate. In this regard, on April 12,
1994, the Commission issued a 

Public Notice

 soliciting public comment on various filings seeking modification or elimination of PTAR. Parties filing comments
thus far, however, have failed to present a rigorous economic framework for analysis, supported by adequate data,
that will enable the Commission to assess the competitive effects of the rule and its efficacy in achieving both competition
and non-competition-based public interest goals. Therefore, this 

Notice of Proposed Rule Making

 proposes a framework to evaluate the continued efficacy of the rule.

4. The analytical framework set forth by the Commission recognizes that in 1970, there was a strong cast for taking
government action to correct the effects of a competitively unbalanced market. Accordingly, the FCC established
PTAR. However, with the development of alternative forms of video distribution, the growth of the broadcast industry
(including increased competition among networks for affiliates), and the increase in the number and types of entities
creating nationally distributed video programming, the case for PTAR must be revisited. The analytical framework
proposed in this 

Notice

 provides a means for evaluating the factual and economic assumptions underlying PTAR, to ascertain whether the rule
operates to achieve its intended effects, and what unintended effects it may also cause. In addition, the Commission
will use the framework to evaluate whether the intended and unintended effects further the attainment of legitimate
goals in today's world. The ultimate decision to retain, modify or eliminate the rule will turn on a weighing of its
costs against its benefits.

5. More specifically, the analytical framework seeks comment on the validity of the following three basic ways PTAR
is said to alter the competitive opportunities in the relevant markets for the public good. First, by carving out a
portion of prime time to be used for non-network use, the rule made it easier for independent producers to sell their
programming to the more successful stations in the top markets (

i.e.,

 affiliates of the three major networks). Among the intended effects was the goal of strengthening existing independent
producers and encouraging entry of new ones. From an economic perspective, the Commission had anticipated that the
decrease in supply of programming available to affiliates (caused by PTAR's ban on network and off-network programming)
would increase prices paid for independently produced programming, thus acting as a spur for greater production
and new entry. Thus, the Commission had predicted that the rule would increase the net amount of diverse programming
available to the viewing public and create new competitors to the existing three networks. The 

Notice 

asks commenters to assess this dynamic, raising such questions as: (1) Whether this enhanced opportunity increases
the net amount of independently produced programs available to the public; (2) whether this opportunity increases
the net number of independent program producers serving the market; and (3) whether the limit placed by this opportunity
on an affiliate's ability to carry network or off-network programming during the access period reduces the economic
value of network programming aired during the other parts of prime time, by limiting the potential buyers for these
programs after the network run is complete, thereby depressing the total return on these programs.

6. Second, the rule sought to reduce the networks' role in dictating their affiliates' programming choices, by forbidding
the affiliates in the top 50 markets from running more than three hours of network or off-network programming during
the four-hour prime time period. Thus, the rule was viewed as a way to increase affiliate autonomy and reduce network
dominance. The immediate effect was to ensure that not all of an affiliate's prime time programming came through the
same network filter. The 

Notice

 asks commenters to provide evidence regarding the bargaining positions of affiliates 

vis-a-vis

 their networks. For example, during hours other than the PTAR access period, do affiliates in the top 50 markets carry
programs other than network programs? To what extent does the market dynamic in the top 50 markets dictate performance
in the less populated markets? Are the recent affiliation switches indicative of a change in the relative bargaining
power of the networks and their affiliates, or are these switches due to other factors? To the extent that the behavior
of affiliates might change in some way if PTAR were modified or repealed, how would that affect the programs ultimately
available to viewers? The 

Notice

 solicits comment on these and other related issues.

7. Third, the rule has come to be viewed as a mechanism for strengthening independent stations, with the result of increasing
the strength and number of the primary buyers of independently produced programming. The argument is that, with this
increase, not only are the number of independent program producers increasing, but the opportunity for new networks
to emerge and compete with the existing networks is enhanced (by the presence of a healthy pool of independent stations).
Thus, by strengthening independent stations overall, the rule has been considered to further both diversity and
competition goals. Moreover, the independent stations themselves produce some degree of original programming,
which contributes to the overall levels of diverse programming available in the market. The 

Notice 

thus invites comment on whether, given the current level of program diversity, the competitive alteration that PTAR
causes with respect to a segment of the market is warranted. Similarly, the 

Notice

 asks commenters to address the degree to which, from economic and public interest perspectives, PTAR leads to misallocated
resources, limits viewers' programming choices, and alters the optimal prices paid. The 

Notice

 seeks comment on its analysis of this issue in general, and in particular raises questions such as: (1) whether regulatory
measures designed to encourage the introduction into the broadcast industry of increased competition in the form
of new networks remain necessary when the established networks and their affiliates are also competing against nonbroadcast
video services; and (2) whether any inefficiencies of encouraging entry of new networks by placing limits on incumbents
are outweighed by real benefits, and if so, what types and what number of inefficiencies and benefits.

8. In addition to seeking comment on the above-described ways in which PTAR alters the competitive opportunities
in the relevant markets, the Commission framed certain overarching issues going to the public interest basis for
PTAR, including, but not limited to, whether non-broadcast media should be considered in assessing the rule, whether
PTAR is the appropriate mechanism to ensure diversity for those who do not avail themselves of technological alternatives
to broadcast television, and whether other regulatory responses other than PTAR would be more effective or efficient
to achieve the stated goals of the rule.

9. To the extent that the record to be developed might support retaining PTAR in whole or part, the Commission seeks
public comment on the incidental elements of the rule_the definition of a ``network'' for purposes of the rule, and
the various program categories that are exempted from application of PTAR. Moreover, although the policy examinations
to be undertaken in this proceeding may make it unnecessary to address specific constitutional questions raised
by the rule, if the rule is to be retained in some form, the Commission seeks comment on various constitutional implications
of the rule and any proposed alternatives.

10. The Commission seeks comment on these issues, as well as specific economic analysis and supporting data favoring
either retention, modification or repeal of the rule. If the Commission chooses to modify or eliminate the rule, we
must then determine when to do so and whether to adopt transition measures. A modification to the rule might be appropriately
enacted immediately after such a decision is made, or through a timetable that allows industry participants to adjust
to the changing economic conditions that might result from modifications to PTAR. Elimination of the rule might be
tied to technological developments or the timing might be tied to regulatory developments such as the scheduled expiration
of the fyn/syn rules of some time thereafter. Similarly, a transition mechanism could be based on a variety of different
considerations, focusing on defining the stages of that transition if one is adopted. For example, one possible transition
would entail initial repeal of the off-network restriction followed by later repeal of the remainder of the rule.
The 

Notice

 questions whether such a staggered repeal of the rule would further the public interest by reducing marketplace disruption
or would delay the realization of benefits that could otherwise be realized from immediate form. In summary, should
the record support elimination or modification of the rule, the Commission will require a record regarding the timing
of any action and whether specific transition measures are necessary or appropriate.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) denies the petition submitted by the State of Florida
for approval of alternate odometer disclosure requirements. Only one comment was submitted in response to NHTSA's
preliminary determination that Florida's proposed procedures threaten the integrity of the current disclosure
system. The agency reaffirms that determination, and Florida must conform its procedures to the odometer disclosure
requirements of 49 CFR Part 580.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



To address the problem of odometer fraud, 49 U.S.C. Chapter 327 (previously 15 U.S.C. 1981 

et seq

.) (the Act) provides that each person transferring ownership of a motor vehicle must disclose the mileage on the vehicle's
title. The Act requires the States to conform their procedures to ensure that the titles they issue contain odometer
disclosure statements. Section 32705(d) of the Act directs NHTSA to approve alternate methods of odometer disclosure
submitted by a State, provided that those methods are consistent with the purposes of the disclosure required by the
Act. 

NHTSA's implementing regulation, 49 CFR Part 580, identifies specific elements to be included in the odometer disclosure
statement (49 CFR 580.5 and 580.7). The elements of central importance to the instant petition are the name and current
address of both the transferor and the transferee. The regulation also sets forth procedures a petitioning State
must follow to seek approval of alternate requirements to those otherwise required of the State (49 CFR 580.11). In
accordance with this latter provision, the State of Florida submitted a petition for approval of alternate disclosure
requirements. 



Basis for the Petition 



Florida seeks approval for alternative procedures to those contained in 49 U.S.C. 32705(b) (previously 15 U.S.C.
1988(d)) and 49 CFR 580.5 (c)(3) and (c)(4). (The petition identifies paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of the regulation,
but it is clear from its context that paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) were intended.) These provisions require odometer
disclosure statements to be made on a title produced by means of a secure printing process and to include the name and
current address of the transferor and transferee. 

Florida currently uses two motor vehicle title forms, copies of which were submitted with the petition. In all aspects
of relevance here, the forms are identical. Both forms contain one block for transfer of title by the seller on the front
and three blocks for dealer reassignment and one block for application for title on the back. Florida states that the
transfer of title and the dealer reassignment blocks appear as prescribed by 49 CFR 580.5, except that they do not contain
a space for the address of the transferor and transferee. Notwithstanding the absence of address spaces in these locations,
Florida asserts that its titles comply with the Federal requirements in all cases except those involving reassignment
by a licensed motor vehicle dealer. 

Florida explains that State law (Florida Statutes, Chapter 319) precludes the assignment of a motor vehicle title
by anyone other than the person in whose name the title was issued, unless the person is a dealer. Consequently, in a
sale between non-dealers, Florida points out that the required addresses will be available because the transferor's
address appears on the front of the title and the transferee's address will eventually appear in the block for ``Application
for Title by Purchaser.'' Citing NHTSA's determination (53 FR No. 151 at 29470, Aug. 5, 1988) that information located
elsewhere on the title need not be repeated in the disclosure statement, Florida argues that its titles comply with
Federal requirements related to transfers between non-dealers. 

The alternate procedures for which Florida seeks approval apply to transfers by or between licensed dealers. Florida
acknowledges that its titles do not make accommodation for the address of a dealer. Instead, the dealer is required
to include its license number in the reassignment block appearing on the back of the title, when effecting a subsequent
transfer. According to Florida, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHS) maintains records of all
licensed dealers in the State, indexed by both license number and name, from which current address information is
freely available upon request. Florida asserts that this system is superior to the requirement of NHTSA's regulation,
because the State records contain the latest available address information, and because consumers can be informed
by the DHS of avenues of relief through the State's consumer complaint process and its $25,000 dealer license bond.
Accordingly, Florida concludes that the odometer disclosure procedures it imposes on dealers are fully consistent
with the purposes behind the Federal odometer disclosure requirements, and that its petition should therefore be
granted.

Notice of Preliminary Determination 


On August 29, 1994, NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44397) preliminarily denying Florida's petition. NHTSA determined that an odometer disclosure statement
that does not include the addresses of transferors and transferees threatens the integrity of the current system,
and that Florida's proposed alternative does not properly accommodate the purposes which these addresses serve.

NHTSA rejected the procedures Florida would impose on transactions in which at least one party is a dealer as inconsistent
with the purposes of the Federal requirements. Noting that the DHS would be unable to provide the required address
information from its records if an out-of-state dealer were involved in the chain of transfer on a Florida title, NHTSA
determined that Florida's approach failed to accommodate interstate motor vehicle transfers. NHTSA further noted
that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the location of an out-of-state dealer without any identifying
information beyond a license number from an unknown State. 
NHTSA concluded that Florida's proposed procedures would hinder enforcement efforts, which rely on readily available
address information for all transferors and transferees in order to trace the sales histories of motor vehicles.
The agency also noted that title blocks lacking a common information element accepted by most States as the norm for
compliance with odometer disclosure requirements are more likely to be questioned or rejected in interstate transactions,
thereby hindering the flow of commerce in motor vehicles. 
With respect to motor vehicle transfers in which no party is a dealer, NHTSA agreed that Florida's odometer disclosure
procedures satisfy Federal odometer disclosure requirements. However, NHTSA recommended that the purchaser's
address appear in the transfer block on the front of the title for improved clarity. 


Comments 


In response to the Notice of Preliminary Determination, The agency received only one comment, which was submitted
by the California Department of Motor Vehicles after the close of the comment period. Despite its lateness, NHTSA
has considered the comment. 
According to California, national title standards developed by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators
and accepted by the States set forth requirements for title document size and contents. California asserts that these
standards and State statutes often preclude the inclusion of additional information on the title document. Due to
these title size limitations, California is concerned that mandating the address information might reduce the space
available for dealer reassignment blocks and therefore lead to increased paperwork in title transfers. 
As a preliminary matter, NHTSA would point out that neither State statutes nor association standards may act to preclude
the disclosure of information required by Federal law. Moreover, California fails to acknowledge that all other
States (except Florida) have properly accommodated the requirement for including address information in the odometer
disclosure statement, and many of these States' titles include multiple dealer reassignment blocks. Hence, California's
concern is not reflected in real world problems. California has only recently begun to conform its titling procedures
with Federal odometer requirements, and should consult other States for guidance in this matter. 


Final Determination 


The agency is in possession of no information that would suggest that a change in the preliminary determination is
appropriate. Accordingly, NHTSA reaffirms its preliminary determination and denies Florida's petition for approval
of alternate odometer disclosure requirements. Florida must conform its procedures to the odometer disclosure
requirements of 49 CFR Part 580. Additionally, the agency urges Florida to include a block for the purchaser's address
on the front of the title, for improved clarity.

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Stone Crab Fishery of
the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). This rule would establish a temporary moratorium, ending not later than June 30, 1998, on
the Federal registration of stone crab vessels by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), and
would invalidate any Federal numbers and color codes issued by the Regional Director after July 1, 1994, for use on
stone crab vessels and gear. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to correct and clarify the regulations, conform them
to current standards, and enhance enforcement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR part 654 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



The stone crab fishery managed under the FMP is located entirely off the coast of Florida, with the majority of harvest
from Florida's waters. Florida has actively managed the fishery since 1929. The FMP was implemented in 1979, principally
to regulate the activities of shrimp vessels registered in states other than Florida to resolve gear conflicts with
stone crab fishermen. Other FMP objectives included managing the stone crab resource for optimum yield, conserving
the stocks while attaining full utilization, establishing an effective reporting system, and promoting uniformity
of the regulations throughout the management area. The FMP, as amended addressed the gear conflicts and adopted Florida's
rules for stone crab in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). 

The biological condition of the stone crab fishery is stable, with landings of claws averaging about 3 million lb (1.36
million kg) annually. During the early development of the fishery, annual landings increased as fishing effort increased;
however, landings since 1985 have not increased while fishing effort has doubled. The fishery currently has more
participants and stone crab traps than are necessary to harvest efficiently the optimum yield. 

Florida is considering a moratorium on the issuance of State permits for the stone crab fishery while alternatives
for a possible effort limitation or controlled access system are considered. The current regulations provide for
the issuance by the Regional Director of Federal numbers and color codes for stone crab fishing in the EEZ when an applicant
is unable to obtain a State permit. However, the Regional Director has not issued any Federal numbers/color codes
under the current regulations. Amendment 5 would place a temporary moratorium ending not later than June 30, 1998,
on the issuance by the Regional Director of Federal numbers and color codes for use on stone crab vessels and gear, and
would invalidate any permits issued between July 1, 1994, and the effective date of the regulations implementing
Amendment 5. This moratorium would end no later than June 30, 1998, and would discourage speculative entry into the
fishery while potential effort or access controls are considered by the industry, Florida, and the Council.

NMFS published notification of the proposed moratorium on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33947), which advised fishermen that,
if Amendment 5 is approved and implemented, any Federal numbers/color codes issued between July 1, 1994, and the effective
date of the implementing regulations would no longer be valid. 

During the 4-year moratorium period, it is reasonably expected that the Council will propose further management
measures that would revise the provisions for the issuance of Federal numbers/color codes. Accordingly, NMFS proposes
to remove the current provisions regarding Federal issuance of numbers/color codes at this time rather than suspend
their effectiveness for the 4-year period. If needed, any such provisions will be implemented by a subsequent rulemaking
to be effective when the moratorium actually expires. 



Additional Measures in Amendment 5 



Amendment 5 proposes a procedure whereby the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC) may request the Regional
Director to implement in the EEZ by regulatory amendment, with the Council's review and concurrence, modification
to certain gear and harvest limitations applicable to State waters that were proposed by the FMFC and approved by the
Florida Governor and Cabinet. The regulatory amendment process requires publication of a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, a public comment period, and, if the rule is approved, publication of a final rule in the 

Federal Register

. The specific steps of the regulatory amendment procedure under the enhanced cooperative management system proposed
in Amendment 5 are contained on pages 8&hyph;10 of the amendment. 

Under Amendment 5, the Council, FMFC, and NMFS would adopt a protocol that describes the roles and positions of the
Federal and State governments in the management of the stone crab fishery. The provisions of the protocol would be
as follows: 

1. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the fishery is a State fishery (which extends into the EEZ) in terms of current
participants in the directed fishery, major nursery, fishing, and landing areas, and historical regulation; and
it is a fishery requiring cooperative State/Federal efforts for effective management through an FMP. 

2. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the State is managing and will continue to manage the resource to protect and
increase the long-term yields and prevent depletion of the stone crab stocks and that the State Administrative Procedure
Act and rule implementation procedures, including final approval of the rules by Governor and Cabinet, provide ample
and fair opportunity for all persons to participate in the rulemaking procedure. 

3. The FMFC acknowledges that rules proposed for implementation under this amendment must be consistent with the
management objectives of the FMP, the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable
Federal law. Federal rules will be implemented in accordance with regulatory amendment procedures. 

4. The Council and NMFS agree that, for any of the rules defined within this amendment, the State may propose the rule
directly to NMFS, concurrently informing the Council of the nature of the rule, and that NMFS will implement the rule
within the EEZ, provided it is consistent under protocol number 3. If the Council informs NMFS of its concern that the
rule may be inconsistent with the FMP and Federal law (protocol number 3), NMFS will not implement the rule until the
Council, FMFC, and NMFS, or their representatives, meet and resolve the issue. 

5. The State will have the responsibility for collecting and developing the information upon which to base the fishing
rules, with assistance by NMFS, as needed, and will cooperatively share the responsibility for enforcement with
the Federal agencies. 

6. The FMFC will provide NMFS and the Council written explanations of its decisions related to each of the rules (including
a statement of the problem that the rulemaking addresses, how the rule will solve the problem, and how interested parties
were involved in the rulemaking), summaries of public comments, biological, economic and social analyses of the
impacts of the proposed rule and alternatives, and such other information that is relevant.

7. The rules will apply to the management area (the EEZ off the west coast of Florida and off the south side of the Florida
Keys). 


8. NMFS agrees that its staff will prepare the proposed (and final) Federal rule. The Council agrees that its staff,
with assistance by the staffs of FMFC and NMFS, will prepare the environmental assessment, regulatory impact review,
and/or other documents required in support of the rule. 


The Council believes that using a regulatory amendment procedure under the protocol would provide more flexible,
responsive, and cost-effective management of the stone crab fishery. The following rules or regulatory changes
could be implemented under the protocol: Limiting the number of traps that may be fished by each vessel; the construction
characteristics of traps; gear and vessel identification requirements; gear that may be used or prohibited in a directed
fishery; bycatch levels in non-directed fisheries; seasons; soak/removal periods and requirements for traps;
use, possession and handling of stone crabs aboard vessels; and minimum legal sizes. 


Concomitant with the proposed regulatory amendment procedure, Amendment 5 proposes to add to the objectives of the
FMP the following: ``Provide for a more flexible management system that minimizes regulatory delay to assure more
effective, cooperative state and federal management of the fishery.'' 


These additional measures in Amendment 5 do not require implementing regulations. 


Additional background and rationale for the measures discussed above are contained in Amendment 5, the availability
of which was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on September 30, 1994 (59 FR 49908). 




Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS 




In a significant number of sections, the stone crab regulations do not conform to current standards applicable to
other federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern Atlantic states. Accordingly, NMFS proposes
to revise the entire part 654. The substantive changes proposed by NMFS are discussed below. 


The purpose and scope section, &sect;654.1, would be revised to clarify the geographical scope of the regulations.



In &sect;654.2, unused definitions would be removed and the address of the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, would
be corrected. 


The vessel and gear identification requirements, currently in &sect;654.4, are essentially identical to Florida's
requirements. Since all required identification markings would be issued by Florida, separate Federal vessel and
gear identification requirements would no longer be necessary. Accordingly, this rule would refer to pertinent
rules of Florida for such requirements. 


In &sect;654.7, the prohibitions would be restated and prohibitions would be added: (1) On using fishing gear in a
manner to obstruct fishing or damage vessels and gear; (2) on making a false statement to an authorized officer; and
(3) regarding interference with an investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized property in connection
with enforcement of the Magnuson Act. 


For uniformity and clarity, NMFS proposes to restate the seasonal trawl closures in the area off the southwestern
coast of Florida and in the shrimp/stone crab separation zones in terms of ``trawling.'' Currently the regulations
at &sect;654.23 state these closures in terms of ``trawl gear'' and ``fish(ing) for shrimp.'' For the southwestern
Florida closure, the change in terminology is not substantive. For the shrimp/stone crab separation zones, the change
would ease a restriction, in that fishing for shrimp by traps would not be prohibited in the zones/times in which fishing
for shrimp is currently prohibited. In terms of gear separation, which is the purpose of the shrimp/stone crab separation
zones, fixed gear and trawling would continue to be separated. In addition, the description of the area of the southwestern
Florida seasonal trawl closure, and its depiction currently in figure 1, would be clarified to describe and show only
the area that is in the EEZ.

<TEXT>
 

The current regulations at &sect;654.23(b)(2) prohibit intentional/willful interference with fishing or obstruction
or damage of a fishing vessel or fishing gear. The placement of this prohibition in the paragraph dealing with the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones creates an inference that it applies only in such zones. However, the rules that originally
implemented the prohibition stated that it applied ``in the FCZ'' (49 FR 30713, August 1, 1984). The former FCZ (fisheries
conservation zone) is now the EEZ. Because such interference, obstruction, or damage is reprehensible wherever
it occurs, NMFS proposes to clarify that these acts are prohibited throughout the management area. The inclusion
of the phrase ``with intent to'' and the word ``willfully'' in the current language regarding these acts significantly
reduces their effectiveness_proof of intent or willfulness is difficult. To enhance enforceability, NMFS proposes
to remove ``with intent to'' and ``willfully'' and substitute ``knowingly'' in each case. Proof of a violation would
then hinge on the placement, or use of articles or gear that cause obstruction or damage, if such placement or use was
other than by accident. 


The procedures for creation or modification of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones to prevent gear conflicts,
currently at &sect;654.24 would be removed. These procedures apply to Florida regulatory agencies, the Council,
and NMFS and are contained in the FMP. However, they are not regulatory in nature; that is, they do not control the behavior
of fishermen. Therefore, their inclusion in the regulations is not necessary. 




Classification 




Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires NMFS to publish regulations proposed by a council within 15 days
of receipt of an amendment and regulations. At this time, NMFS has not determined that Amendment 5 is consistent with
the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making that determination,
will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 


This action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 


The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed moratorium on Federal registration of stone
crab vessels operating in the EEZ would not: (1) Reduce the number of current participants 
in the fishery, harvest levels, or annual gross revenues of participants; (2) affect production or compliance costs
of participants; (3) require capital investment to comply with the rule; or (4) require a current participant to cease
business. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

&sect;654.20 

Seasons. 


(a) 

Closed season. 

No person may possess a stone crab in the management area from 12:01 a.m., local time, May 16, through 12:00 midnight,
local time, October 14, each year. Holding a stone crab in a trap in the water during a soak period or 
during a removal period (see paragraph (b) of this section), or during any extension thereto, is not deemed possession,
provided that, if the trap is removed from the water during such period, such crab is returned immediately to the water
with its claws unharvested. 
(b) 

Placement of traps. 

(1) Prior to the fishing season, the period of October 5 through October 14 is established as a trap soak period. A stone
crab trap may be placed in the management area not earlier than 1 hour before sunrise on October 5. 
(2) After the fishing season, the period of May 16 through May 20 is established as a trap removal period. A stone crab
trap must be removed from the management area not later than 1 hour after sunset on May 20, unless an extension to the
removal period is granted by Florida in accordance with Rule 46&hyph;13.002(2)(b), Florida Administrative Code.
This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission, 2540 Executive Center Circle,
West, Suite 106, Tallahassee, FL 32301; telephone 904&hyph;487&hyph;0554. Copies may be inspected at the Southeast
Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702, or the Office of the Federal Register,
800 North Capitol Street, NW., Room 700, Washington, DC 20002. The extension authorization must be carried aboard
the fishing vessel. The operator of a fishing vessel must present the authorization for inspection upon request of
an authorized officer. 
(c) 

Possession of stone crab traps. 

A stone crab trap may not be possessed in the management area from the end of the trap removal period, or an extension
thereto, to the beginning of the trap soak period, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. A stone crab trap,
float, or rope in the management area during this period will be considered unclaimed or abandoned property and may
be disposed of in any manner considered appropriate by the Secretary or an authorized officer. An owner of such trap,
float, or rope remains subject to appropriate civil penalties. 


&sect;654.21 

Harvest limitations. 


(a) 

Claw size. 

No person may remove from a stone crab in or from the management area, or possess in the management area, a claw with a
propodus measuring less than 2.75 inches (7.0 cm), measured in a straight line from the elbow to the tip of the lower
immovable finger. The propodus is the largest section of the claw assembly that has both a movable and immovable finger
and is located farthest from the body when the entire appendage is extended. (See Appendix A, Figure 1.) 
(b) 

Egg-bearing stone crabs. 

An egg-bearing stone crab in or from the management area must be returned immediately to the water unharmed_without
removal of a claw. An egg-bearing stone crab may not be stripped of its eggs or otherwise molested. 
(c) 

Holding stone crabs. 

A live stone crab in or from the management area may be held aboard a vessel until such time as a legal-sized claw is removed,
provided it is held in a container that is shaded from direct sunlight and it is wet with sea water as necessary to keep
it in a damp condition. Containers holding stone crabs must be stacked in a manner that does not compress the crabs.
A stone crab body from which a legal-sized claw has been removed must be returned to the sea before the vessel reaches
shore or a port or dock.

Gear restrictions. 


(a) 

Biodegradable panels. 

A stone crab trap used or possessed in the management area must have a panel constructed of wood or cotton and located
on a side of the trap at least two slats above the bottom, or on the top of the trap, which, when removed, will leave an opening
in the trap measuring at least 2.5 inches by 5 inches (6.35 cm by 12.7 cm). 
(b) 

Daylight hours. 

A stone crab trap in the management area may be pulled or tended during daylight hours only, that is, from 1 hour before
sunrise to 1 hour after sunset. 
(c) 

Gear belonging to others. 

No fisherman may willfully tend, open, pull, or otherwise molest another fisherman's trap, buoy, or line in the management
area without the prior written consent of that fisherman. 


&sect;654.23 

Southwest Florida seasonal trawl closure. 


From January 1 to 1 hour after sunset (local time) May 20, each year, the area described in this section is closed to trawling,

Shrimp/stone crab separation zones. 


Five zones are established in the management area and Florida's waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation
of shrimp trawling and stone crab trapping. 
The zones are as shown in Appendix A, Figure 3. Although 
Zone II is entirely within Florida's waters, it is included in this paragraph and Appendix A, Figure 3, for the convenience
of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's waters are
contained in 
Rule 46&hyph;38.001, Florida Administrative Code. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director
of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Florida
