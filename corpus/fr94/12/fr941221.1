 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure, inspections
and checks to detect discrepancies, and correction of discrepancies. This proposal is prompted by the development
of a modification of the strut and wing structure that improves the fail-safe capability and durability of the strut-to-wing
attachments, and reduces reliance on inspections of those attachments. The actions specified by the proposed AD
are intended to prevent failure of the strut and subsequent loss of the engine.

Discussion 




The FAA has received numerous reports of fatigue cracking and/or corrosion in 
the strut-to-wing attachments on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. In two cases, such 
cracking resulted in the failure of a strut load path and the subsequent loss of the number 
3 engine and strut. In both cases, catastrophic accidents occurred when the number 3 
engine and strut separated from the wing of the airplane and struck the number 4 engine, 
causing it to separate from the airplane. Investigation into the cause of these accidents 
and other reported incidents revealed not only that fatigue cracks and corrosion in the 
strut-to-wing attachments, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, can result in 
failure of the strut and subsequent separation of the engine from the airplane, but that the 
structural fail-safe capability of the strut-to-wing attachment is inadequate on these 
airplanes. 

The FAA has previously issued 17 AD's that address various problems associated 
with the strut attachment assembly on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. These AD's 
have required, among other things, inspections of the strut, strut-to-wing attachment 
structure, and wing backup structure of Model 747 series airplanes that are equipped with 
Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 series engines). 



Explanation of Service Information 



Boeing recently has developed a modification of the strut-to-wing attachment 
structure installed on certain Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney 
Model JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines) that significantly 
improves the load-carrying capability and durability of the strut-to-wing attachments. 
Such improvement also will substantially reduce the possibility of fatigue cracking and 
corrosion from developing in the attachment assembly. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of 
the nacelle strut and wing structure. This modification entails the following: 

1. Providing a new fail-safe load path by installing a new dual side load fitting to 
the strut and the underwing structure and the associated wing back-up fitting, front spar 
post, and side links; 


2. Strengthening the strut by installing a new midspar web and a new lower spar 
web and/or channel stiffener; 

3. Strengthening the internal wing structure by installing a new stiffener at the 
wing midspar; 

4. Improving the strut-to-wing attachments by installing new stainless steel 
midspar fittings on the strut, replacing aluminum fittings with new titanium midspar 
underwing fittings, and replacing the upper link and the diagonal brace; 

5. Enhancing the diagonal brace underwing fitting by installing certain new nuts 
and tension bolts; and 

6. Modifying the electrical wiring and hydraulics by rerouting certain wire 
bundles around the new dual side load fitting and installing new hydraulic tubes. 

This alert service bulletin specifies that the modification of the nacelle strut and 
wing structure is to be accomplished prior to, or concurrently with, the terminating 
actions described in the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.C., Table 2, ``Prior or 
Concurrent Service Bulletins,'' on page 13 of this alert service bulletin. These 
terminating actions include the following: 

1. Replacement of the diagonal brace, midspar, and upper link fusepins with new 
third generation 15&hyph;5 corrosion-resistant steel fusepins; 

2. Replacement of the diagonal brace strut and wing attachment fittings; 

3. Strengthening of the wing front spar; and 

4. Replacement of the forward engine mounting nut. 

Paragraph III, NOTES 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the Accomplishment Instructions on 
pages 149 and 150 of the alert service bulletin also describe procedures for inspections 
and checks to detect discrepancies of the adjacent structure, and correction of any 
discrepancies. 



Explanation of the Provisions of the Proposed AD 



Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of 
the nacelle strut and wing structure, inspections and checks to detect discrepancies in the 
adjacent structure, and correction of discrepancies. The actions would be required to be 
accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 

The FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety will be 
better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem, rather than by 
repetitive inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety 
assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better 
understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual inspections, has 
led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on 
design improvements. The proposed modification requirement is in consonance with 
these considerations. 


Accomplishment of the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure would 
terminate the inspections currently required by the following AD's:

The compliance time for accomplishing the proposed modification has been 
broken out into separate groupings. Airplanes that are younger than 15 years must be 
modified within 56 months after the effective date of the AD, and airplanes that are 15 
years and older must be modified within 32 months after the effective date of the AD. The FAA's intent is to require modification
of older airplanes at an earlier date, since they 
are more likely to be subject to fatigue cracking and corrosion. 


The FAA recognizes that the modifications described in the service bulletins 
listed in paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
747&hyph;54A21
59, dated November 3, 1994, upgrades the structural integrity of the strut. 
These modifications include replacement of the upper link, lower spar fitting, diagonal 
brace, and mounting nut for the forward engine. Additionally, these modifications entail 
rework of the midspar fitting lugs and fitting attachments; and include the installation of 
third generation fuse pins at the strut midspar, diagonal brace, and wing-to-strut 
attachments of the upper link. The FAA finds that the proposed compliance time (for 
installation of the proposed modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure) for 
airplanes on which these other modifications previously have been accomplished may be 
extended without compromising the safety of the fleet. Therefore, the FAA has further 
divided the proposed compliance times for airplanes that are 15 years or older to 
segregate the requirements of those airplanes that have and have not been modified 
previously. 


For example, for airplanes on which the modifications described in the service 
bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of the Boeing alert 
service bulletin, 

have

 been accomplished, modification of the nacelle strut and wing 
structure would be required within 56 months; while, for airplanes on which the 
modifications referenced by paragraph I.D. 

have not

 been accomplished, modification of 
the nacelle strut and wing structure would be required within 32 months. 

Further, the FAA acknowledges the work that has been accomplished previously 
by creating separate groupings for those airplanes on which certain, but not all, of the 
modifications have been accomplished. Therefore, if the modification described in 
Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986 (which is one of the service 
bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of the Boeing alert 
service bulletin),

 has not 

been accomplished, but all other modifications referenced by 
paragraph I.D. 

have

 been accomplished, the FAA's intent is to allow operators of these 
airplanes to continue to perform the inspections of the fastener holes that currently are 
required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, amendment 39&hyph;5546 (52 FR 3421, February 4, 1987). 
However, those inspections must be performed at a reduced interval of 1,000 landings, 
until such time that the proposed modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure is 
accomplished. For these airplanes, modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure 
would be required within 56 months after the effective date of this AD.

Similarly, if rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs described in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin
747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993, 

has not

 been accomplished, but all other modifications referenced by paragraph I.D. 

have

 been accomplished, then the rework should be done in accordance with Revision 2 of that alert service bulletin. Operators
of these airplanes that have already reworked the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs in accordance with the
original issue or Revision 1 of that alert service bulletin can receive an extension of the compliance time to 56 months,
provided that ultrasonic inspections are performed (to detect cracking of the inboard and outboard midspar fitting
lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut) within 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of the rework, whichever
occurs earlier, in accordance with Revision 2 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated September
16, 1993. For these airplanes, repetitive inspections would be required at intervals not to exceed 500 landings for
inboard struts and 1,000 landings for outboard struts. The FAA has approved Revision 2 of this alert service bulletin
as an alternative method of compliance to accomplish the requirements of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8678
(58 FR 45827, August 31, 1993), which references Revision 1 and the original issue of that alert service bulletin as
the appropriate sources of service information to perform this ultrasonic inspection. The FAA acknowledges that
this compliance time is earlier than that required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07; however, performance of this inspection
would defer modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure until 56 months after the effective date of this AD
for these airplanes. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 



Cost Estimate 



There are approximately 600 Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines
(excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines) of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 146
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 

The proposed modification may take as many as 7,700 to 8,892 work hours to accomplish, depending upon the configuration
of the airplane. The manufacturer would incur the cost of labor, on a pro-rated basis, with 20 years being the expected
life of these airplanes. The total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is based on the median age for the
fleet of Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines, which is estimated
to be 15 years. The average labor rate is estimated to be $60 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer
at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the cost impact of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to
be between $50,589,000 ($346,500 per airplane) and $58,420,440 ($400,140 per airplane). 

This cost impact figure does not reflect the cost of the terminating actions described in the service bulletins listed
in paragraph I.C., Table 2, ``Prior or Concurrent Service Bulletins,'' on page 13 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin
747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, that are proposed to be accomplished prior to or concurrently with the
modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure. Since some operators may have accomplished certain modifications
on some or all of the airplanes in its fleet, while other operators may not have accomplished any of the modifications
on any of the airplanes in its fleet, the FAA is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of accomplishing
the terminating actions described in the service bulletins listed in Table 2 of the Boeing alert service bulletin.
As indicated earlier in this preamble, the FAA invites comments specifically on the overall economic aspects of this
proposed rule. Any data received via public comments to this notice will aid the FAA in developing an accurate accounting
of the cost impact of the rule. 

The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, prudent operators would accomplish the required
actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 

A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
the original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary
to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a
full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 



Regulatory Impact 



The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 



&sect;39.13


[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:

 




Boeing: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;187&hyph;AD.

 




Applicability:

 Model 747 series airplanes having line positions 001 through 814 inclusive, equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney Model
JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines), certificated in any category. 






Note 1:

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (d) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. 






Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 

To prevent failure of the strut and subsequent loss of the engine, accomplish the following: 

(a) Accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin
747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, at the time specified in either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD, as
applicable. All of the terminating actions described in the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.C., Table 2,
``Prior or Concurrent Service Bulletins,'' on page 13 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated

fastener holes in both strut midspar fittings on the inboard and outboard nacelle struts, as 
required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1 at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings, in accordance with 
Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986, until the modification of the 
nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service 
Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994.

 



Note 3:

 These inspections of the fastener holes are required by AD 
87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, amendment 39&hyph;5546, at 4,000-landing intervals. Accomplishment of the inspections
of the fastener holes, as required by this paragraph at 1,000-landing intervals, 
constitutes compliance with paragraph A. of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1.

 

(iii) For airplanes on which all of the modifications described in the service 
bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service 
Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, have been accomplished; except that 
rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs was accomplished in 
accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, 
or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993, instead of Revision 2, dated September 16, 1993: 
(A) Within 56 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the 
modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the 
adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. 
(B) Prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since rework of the 
lugs, whichever occurs earlier, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking of the 
inboard and outboard midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut, in 
accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, Revision 2, dated 
September 16, 1993. Repeat this inspection thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07.

 



Note 4:

 This ultrasonic inspection is required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, amendment 
39&hyph;8678, to be performed prior to the accumulation of 5,000 landings or 5 years since 
accomplishment of the rework of the lugs, whichever occurs earlier, in accordance with 
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, 
dated July 15, 1993. Repetitive inspections are required by that AD at intervals not to 
exceed 500 landings for inboard struts and 1,000 landings for outboard struts. Since the 
issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved Revision 2 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
747&hyph;54A2152, dated September 16, 1993, as an alternative method of compliance for 
accomplishment of these ultrasonic inspections and rework of the lugs. Revision 2 of the 
alert service bulletin recommends that lugs that have been reworked in accordance with 
the original issue or Revision 1 of the alert service bulletin be inspected prior to the 
accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of the rework of the 
lugs, whichever occurs earlier. Therefore, accomplishment of ultrasonic inspections prior 
to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of rework of the 
lugs, whichever occurs earlier, and thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, constitutes 
compliance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07. 
(iv) For airplanes on which all of the modifications described in the service 
bulletins referenced by paragraph I.D., ``Compliance,'' on page 17 of Boeing Alert Service 
Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated November 3, 1994, have been accomplished; except that 
rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs was accomplished in 
accordance with the Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 
1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993, instead of Revision 2, dated September 16, 
1993; and excluding the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, 
dated July 25, 1986: 
(A) Within 56 months after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the 
modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure and perform the inspections of the 
adjacent structure that has not been replaced by the modification. 
(B) Repeat the ultrasonic inspections to detect cracking of the aft-most two 
fastener holes in both strut midspar fittings on the inboard and outboard nacelle struts, as 
required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;13 R1, at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings, in accordance 
with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2118, dated July 25, 1986, until the modification of 
the nacelle strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert 
Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994. 
(C) Prior to the accumulation of 2,500 landings or 3 years since rework of the 
lugs, whichever occurs earlier, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracking of the 
inboard and outboard midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut, and repeat 
the inspection thereafter as required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, until the modification of the nacelle 
strut and wing structure is accomplished in accordance with Boeing Alert Service 
Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994.

13213(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993), 107 Stat. 473 (1993), which redefined the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
Temporary Regulations and 26 U.S.C. 7805(e)(1) 



In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the IRS is issuing temporary regulations to clarify the treatment of certain allowances received by members of the
Armed Forces in light of changes made by OBRA 1993. Section 7805(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (26 U.S.C.
7805(e)(1)) requires the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever the Secretary issues temporary
regulations to allow an opportunity for public comment. The substance of the temporary regulations is reflected
in the proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;1.61&hyph;2 and 1.217&hyph;2. The IRS intends to revise &sect;&sect;1.61&hyph;2
and 1.217&hyph;2 in response to taxpayers' comments on the proposed regulations. 



Background 



This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 61 and 217
of the Code that are required because of the amendment of section 217(b) by OBRA 1993. In Notice 94&hyph;59, 1994&hyph;1
C.B. 371, the IRS announced its intention to issue guidance to clarify that certain allowances received by members
of the Armed Forces continue to be excludable from gross income notwithstanding the amendment of section 217(b).




Explanation of Provisions 



Section 217(g) of the Code provides that a member of the Armed Forces on active duty who moves pursuant to a military

order and incident to a permanent change of station does not include in income reimbursements or allowances for moving
or storage expenses, or the value of moving and storage services furnished in-kind. For purposes of section 217(g),
moving expenses are defined in section 217(b). OBRA 1993 amended section 217(b) by narrowing the definition of deductible
moving expenses.

As a result of this amendment, questions have arisen concerning the federal tax treatment of certain allowances provided
by the Department of Defense to members of the Armed Forces (and by the Department of Transportation to members of the
Coast Guard) in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station. These allowances include: 

(1) a dislocation allowance, intended to partially reimburse expenses (e.g., lease forfeitures, temporary living
charges in hotels, and breakage of household goods in transit) incurred in relocating a household; 

(2) a temporary lodging expense, intended to partially offset the added living expenses of temporary lodging (up
to 10 days) within the United States; 

(3) a temporary lodging allowance, intended to help defray higher than normal living costs (for up to 60 days) outside
the United States; and 

(4) a moving-in housing allowance, intended to defray costs (e.g., rental agent fees, home-security improvements,
and supplemental heating equipment) associated with occupying leased quarters outside the United States. 

Section 1.61&hyph;2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides, in part, that subsistence and uniform allowances
granted to members of the Armed Forces, Coast and Geodetic Survey (now known as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration), and Public Health Service, and amounts received by them as commutation of quarters, are to be excluded
from gross income. Similarly, the value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded from gross
income. These exclusions from gross income of quarters and subsistence allowances paid to members of the Armed Forces
are ones of long-standing, dating back to 1925. See 

Jones 

v. 

United States, 

60 Ct. Cl. 552 (1925). 

The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that the four above-referenced allowances provided by the Department
of Defense (and by the Department of Transportation ), to the extent not excludable under other provisions of the Code
(such as section 217(g) or section 132(g)), are to be treated as subsistence or quarters allowances. Section 1.61&hyph;2
is proposed to be amended to provide that these allowances are excludable from gross income. The proposed regulations
would also clarify that no deduction is allowed for any expenses incurred in connection with a transfer to a new permanent
duty station to the extent the expenses are reimbursed by an excludable allowance. 

However, any expense that meets the definition of a 

moving expense 

as defined in section 217(b) and is not reimbursed continues to be deductible under current law. 

The regulations are proposed to be effective with respect to allowances for expenses incurred after December 31,
1993. Allowances for expenses incurred prior to January 1, 1994, in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty
station are excludable under section 217(g). 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, these proposed regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the
Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. 



Comments and Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying. 

A public hearing has been scheduled for April 21, 1995, at 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, IRS Building, 1111 Constitution
Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue
Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 

The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 

Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by March 31, 1995, and submit
an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by March 31, 1995.

Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

Background 



The temporary regulations published in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

 add &sect;31.3402(f)(5)&hyph;2T to the Employment Tax Regulations. 
The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the
temporary regulations explains the temporary regulations. Comments are specifically requested on whether electronic
systems should be allowed for additional categories of Forms W&hyph;4 and the extent to which employers should be
allowed to mandate the use of an electronic system, to assist the IRS in determining the appropriate balance between
the advantages to employers of fully electronic systems, ensuring adequate employee access, and the IRS's concerns
relating to enforcement. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 


Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 


Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in any writing by any person that timely submits
written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published
in the 

Federal Register

. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these proposed regulations is Russ Weinheimer, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee
Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

Participation in the Public Meeting 



Attendance is open to the public. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations
during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should notify the person listed above under FOR FURTHER
INFORMATION CONTACT 

no later than the day before the meeting. Written material may be submitted prior to, during, or after the meeting.



Reason for Public Meeting 



On April 27, 1993, the Coast Guard published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on U.S.
waters where tanker escorts should be required, and what other vessels should also be escorted (58 FR 25766). At that
time, however, the escort regulations of 33 CFR part 168 had not yet been published, nor did the ANPRM include any special
guidance on how waterways should be evaluated and nominated for escorting. Therefore, public comments in response
to the ANPRM were made without the benefit of either 33 CFR part 168 or any guidance criteria.

<PARENT> FR941221-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Numerous comments were received in response to the ANPRM. In general, there was no consensus among the comments; in
fact, some waterways were nominated both for and against escorting. In most cases, arguments were subjective and
without supporting data. For example, arguments against escorting frequently cited substantial adverse economic
impact, but did not include any cost analyses. Similarly, nominations for a waterway were frequently made on the basis
of environmental sensitivity to oil spills, but did not include any analyses of navigational hazards to vessels.
Therefore, the Coast Guard is developing criteria for evaluating the navigational risks of a waterway, and how to
determine if escorting is an effective strategy to offset those risks. The purpose of the public meeting is to seek
more direct comment on the criteria (refer to Discussion paragraph (5) further in this notice).


Background and Regulatory History


Section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) requires the Secretary of Transportation
to initiate rulemaking to define areas where single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons (GT) transporting oil in
bulk must be escorted by at least two ``towing vessels'' (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101) or other vessels deemed appropriate.
By statute, these defined areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska and Puget Sound, Washington (and associated
waters). Rulemaking authority under this section has been delegated to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard (49 CFR 1.46(11)).
The Secretary also has broad authority under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), 33 U.S. Code 1221&hyph;1236,
to control vessel traffic in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States which the Secretary determines
to be hazardous by, among other things, establishing vessel operating conditions. Rulemaking authority under this
section has been delegated to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard (49 CFR 1.46(n)(4)).
The Coast Guard is implementing vessel escorting regulations in two separate rulemaking projects: CGD 91&hyph;202
addresses escort requirements for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters, and CGD 91&hyph;202a addresses
escort requirements for other U.S. waters. A final rule for the first rulemaking action (Prince William Sound and
Puget Sound) was published on August 19, 1994 (59 FR 42962). This final rule created 33 CFR part 168. A notice of partial
suspension of effectiveness was published on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54519) which suspended one of the final rule provisions
(the crash-stop criteria) from going into effect pending further technical study and public comment.
With respect to the second rulemaking project, the Coast Guard published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) (58 FR 25766; April 27, 1993) seeking comment on other U.S. waters where an escort should be required, and other
vessels that should also be escorted.

In addition to the published notices for both rulemakings, the Coast Guard also conducted public hearings in Anchorage,
Alaska on June 3, 1993, Valdez, Alaska on June 5, 1993 and Seattle, Washington on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 25959; April 29,
1993, and 58 FR 29157; May 19, 1993). The Alaska hearings were also teleconferenced to include several outlying communities
in the Exxon Valdez impact area.



Discussion



1. Escort Vessel Requirements of OPA 90 and the PWSA



Section 4116(c) of OPA 90 provides authority to require the use of a minimum of two escort vessels for laden single hull
oil tankers over 5,000 GT operating in Prince William Sound, Puget Sound, and other U.S. waters determined to be appropriate.
Therefore, any regulations issued under section 4116(c) must require a minimum of two escort vessels. Further, section
4116(c) provides no authority to require the use of escort vessels for ships other than laden, single-hulled oil tankers
over 5,000 GT. In contrast, the PWSA has no such limitations.



2. Performance-Based Escort Regulations



The escort vessels are to assist a ship that becomes disabled from a loss of propulsion or steering control; the immediate
presence of the escort vessels will reduce its chances of colliding or running aground.

In 33 CFR part 168, the Coast Guard adopted a performance-based approach: The escort vessels must be capable of controlling
the disabled tanker within the navigational limits of the waterway (taking into account transit conditions and certain
other factors), and the tanker must be operated within the performance capabilities of its escorts.

Performance-based regulations do not need to stipulate any particular number of escort vessels because the compliance
process will lead to an appropriate number being utilized (which, in turn, will depend upon the performance capabilities
of the escorts).

OPA 90, however, makes no allowances for the performance capabilities of different escort vessels, nor does it recognize
that smaller ships are easier to control than larger ones. The Coast Guard realizes that there may be circumstances
where a single, high-performance escort vessel can effectively control a disabled ship within the performance requirements
of 33 CFR part 168. In such cases, a second escort vessel may significantly increase costs without any commensurate
increase in environmental protection. In fact, just the opposite effect might occur: the presence of unnecessary
escort vessels, particularly in congested waterways, increases the risks of collision.



3. Determination of Other Appropriate Waters for Escorting in Accordance With OPA 90



In consideration of the preceding discussion, the Coast Guard has determined that, although there may be other U.S.
waters where tanker escorting could be beneficial, there is no need to prescribe an absolute minimum of two escort
vessels in those waters. Likewise, it may be appropriate to require escorts for ships other than laden oil tankers
in excess of 5,000 GT.

Therefore, designating any other U.S. waters for escorting requirements will be accomplished using the Coast Guard's
authority under the PWSA, which allows greater flexibility concerning the ships to be escorted and the number of escort
vessels to be required.



4. Use of PWSA With Respect to Escorting



The use of PWSA authority is intended to complement OPA 90, not replace it. PWSA will only be used in ways that will allow
greater flexibility in escorting while still preserving the environmental protection goals of OPA 90. For example,
PWSA can be used to:

(a) Recognize the capabilities of high-performance escort vessels by allowing applicable ships to be escorted by
a single escort vessel so long as it can still control the ship within the performance criteria of 33 CFR part 168. This
will reduce the risks (and economic burden) of providing a second escort vessel when it is not necessary;

(b) Recognize that not all waterways warrant escorting under benign conditions. This allows escorts to be required
only when sea or weather conditions deteriorate beyond an appropriate threshold;

(c) Similarly, to recognize that not all waterways are so constrained as to present navigational hazards to smaller
ships. This allows escorts to be required only for ships exceeding an appropriate size threshold greater than the
5,000 GT size established by section 4116(c) of OPA 90; or

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941221-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941221-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) Require escorting of ships transporting certain potentially hazardous cargoes, if appropriate.

The Coast Guard does not intend to use PWSA to circumvent other escorting mandates of OPA 90. For example, PWSA will
not be used to provide relief from the two-escort-vessel minimum for Prince William Sound and Puget Sound because
section 4116(c) of OPA 90 clearly requires the use of two escort vessels by laden oil tankers over 5,000 GT operating
in those waters.



5. Waterway Evaluation Criteria



As previously discussed, the Coast Guard is developing criteria for evaluating waterways where escorting should
be required.

The criteria under consideration are based on certain general factors which must be taken into account when issuing
regulations under the PWSA. These factors are located in section 5 of the PWSA (33 U.S.C. 1224). 

The criteria which the Coast Guard is considering using in making determinations with regard to the necessity of escort
vessels are as follows (the criteria are further elaborated by a series of questions which are intended to more-specifically
focus the criteria on escorting):

(a) Scope and degree of risk or hazard involved. What are the navigational limitations of the waterway? How much sea
room (open water, deep water) is available? What hazards (reefs, shoals, oil platforms, etc.) or constrained points
(narrow channels, bridge abutments, etc.) are along the waterway?

What are the risks of grounding, and what is the nature of the bottom (hard, soft, mud, coral, etc.)?

What are the risks of collision?

Are there other risk conditions such as currents, tides, ice, fog, or severe weather patterns?

(b) Vessel traffic characteristics. What are the traffic routes through the waterway?

Who are the other users of the waterway (commercial, military, fishing, recreational) and what traffic density do
they create?

(c) Port and waterway configuration. Where are the terminals located?

How many transits (per year) of ships carrying oil and other potentially hazardous cargo? What are the sizes of such
ships, and are they constrained in their ability to maneuver?

(d) Need for granting exemptions for small vessels. Should small vessels be exempted from escorting? If so, how small?

(e) Proximity to fishing grounds, oil and gas drilling or production operations, or other conflicting activity.
How would these activities be affected by escorting?

(f) Environmental factors. Where are the environmentally-sensitive areas of the waterway? How close do ships carrying
oil and other potentially hazardous cargoes transit?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941221-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941221-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(g) Economic impact and effects. What are the suggested escort zone boundaries? How long (time and distance) are the
escorted routes?

What are the costs for escort services (hourly rates for tugs of various sizes)?

(h) Existing vessel traffic services. Is the waterway served by a vessel traffic system?

Are there regulated navigation areas (RNAs), safety zones, or areas to be avoided?

(i) Local practices and customs. Are there existing (or anticipated) escort requirements for the waterway, such
as State regulations or local Federal requirements? If so, how do they compare with the 33 CFR part 168 escort regulations?

Are there informal escorting programs already in effect?

(j) Disabled vessel response strategies. What self-help measures could be utilized by a disabled ship (for example,
how feasible is anchoring)?

Are escort vessels needed continuously at all points along the waterway, or can a rescue tug be stationed at a strategic
point? Is there adequate sea room for a disabled ship to safely drift while waiting for assistance?

How available are suitable tugs-of-opportunity of various sizes?

(k) Effectiveness of escort vessels. Can the waterway effectively benefit from vessel escorting?

In constrained or congested waterways, can escort vessels accompany a ship without increasing the risk of collision
with other vessels?

Can the escort keep position where it can maneuver and react in time to assist the disabled ship?

Are there other environmental or operating factors which reduce an escort vessel's ability to safely respond?

(1) Graduated requirements. Are graduated requirements appropriate? For example, should escorts only be required
for ships that exceed a size threshold, or when sea or weather conditions degrade below a minimum threshold? If so,
what are those thresholds?

(m) Other risk management strategies. Are there other ways that collision or grounding risks of a disabled ship can
be reduced, such as establishing one-way traffic lanes, designating areas to be avoided, or other measures?

Rulemaking issued under PWSA authority must discuss these factors with respect to each affected waterway. Therefore,
when waterways are nominated for escorting in the future, the nominations should include information related to
these factors.

These criteria will be the principle topic at the public meeting. The Coast Guard is seeking comment on the criteria,
as well as additional criteria which could be used in evaluating waterways with respect to escorting.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the state of Iowa. The state's
request for a revision to the SIP includes updating the state's incorporation by reference and conformity to various
Federal regulations. In the final rules section of the 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct-final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn
and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will
not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should
do so at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 17, 1985 (50 FR 15219), which announced that Chevron Chemical Co., 540 Hensley St., Richmond, CA 94804, had
submitted a pesticide petition (PP 5F3188), proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.205 by establishing tolerances for residues
of the herbicide paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium ion) derived from the application of either the 

bis

(methyl sulfate) or dichloride salt (both calculated as the cation) in or on rice grain and rice straw at 0.05 part per
million (ppm). 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.

The chemical, paraquat, was sold to ICI Americas, 1800 Concord Pike, Wilmington, DE 19897, which later changed its
name to Zeneca Ag Products. The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by submitting a revised Section F proposing
to establish a tolerance for residues of paraquat on rice straw at 0.06 ppm. Because there is a potential increase in
risk to humans from this revision and because it has been longer than 5 years since the original proposal, the tolerances
of 0.05 ppm on rice grain and 0.06 ppm on rice straw are being proposed again for 30 days to allow for public comments.

The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful
for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicological data listed below were considered in support
of these proposed tolerances. 
1. Several acute studies placing technical paraquat in Toxicity Category I. 
2. A 1-year feeding study with dogs fed dosages of 0, 0.45, 0.93, and 1.51 milligrams of paraquat cation/kilogram (mg/kg)
of body weight (bwt) per day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 0.45 mg/kg/day based on increased severity
and extent of chronic pneumonitis in both sexes, but especially in the males at 0.93 mg/kg/day. 
3. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 1.87, 5.62, and 15/18.75 mg/kg/day, expressed
as paraquat cation (the highest dose had to be increased from 15 mg/kg/day to 18.75 mg/kg/day because no toxic signs
appeared at 15 mg/kg/day), with no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study up to and including
15/18.75 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested [HDT]) and a systemic NOEL of 11.87 mg/kg/day, based on renal tubular
degeneration in males and weight loss and decreased food intake in females at 5.62 mg/kg/day. 
4. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats fed dosages of 0, 1.25, 3.75, and 7.5 mg/kg/day expressed
as the cation, with uncertain evidence of carcinogenicity (squamous cell carcinomas in the head region (ears, nasal
cavity, oral cavity, and skin)) in males at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT) and an approximate systemic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day,
based on increased incidence of opacities, cataracts, and nonneoplastic lung lesions (alveolar macrophages, epithelialization,
and slight peribronchiolar lymphoid hyperplasia) at 3.75 mg/kg/day. 
5. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats fed dosages of 0.25/30 (M/F), 1.26/1.50 (M/F), 4.15/5.12
(M/F) and 12.25/15.29 (M/F) mg/kg/day expressed as paraquat dichloride, with no carcinogenic effects at 12.5/15.25
mg/kg/day (HDT) and a systemic NOEL of 4.15/5.12 mg/kg/day based on increased mortality in males and females, decreased
erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and serum protein in males and females, decreased hematocrit, glucose and corpuscular
cholinestrease activity in males, decreased leukocytes, albumin-to-globulin ratio and alkaline phosphatase,
GOT and GDT activities in females, increased polymorphonucleocytes in males, increased potassium and glucose in
females, decreased absolute and/or relative weights of heart (males and females) and liver and brain (females),
and increased absolute weights of kidneys (males and females) and ovaries at 12.5/15.25 mg/kg/day (HDT). 
6. A three-generation reproduction study with rats fed dosages of 0, 1.25, 3.75, and 7.5 mg/kg/day, expressed as cation,
with no reproductive effects observed at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a systemic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day based on increased
incidence of alveolar histiocytosis in the lungs of the male and female parents at 3.75 mg/kg/day. 
7. A developmental toxicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg/day, expressed as cation, with no
teratogenic effects observed occurring at dosages up to and including 10 mg/kg/day (HDT); a fetotoxic NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day
based on partially ossified sternebrae at 10 mg/kg/day; and a maternal toxicity NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on weight
reduction at 5.0 mg/kg/day. 
8. A developmental toxicity study in rats fed dosages of 0, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg/day, expressed at cation with no
teratogenic effects observed at 10 mg/kg; a fetotoxic NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on reductions in weight and slight
retardation in ossification at 5 mg/kg/day; and maternal toxicity NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on piloerection, weight
loss, and hunched appearance at 5.0 mg/kg/day. 
9. Sixteen acceptable mutagenic studies were submitted for paraquat. These include six gene mutation assays with


S. typhimurium

 (T4 92, TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and G&hyph;6 histidine-requiring strains) and 

A. nidulans

 (strains 35 and P3); and L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in culture; four structural chromosome aberration assays including
dominant-lethal assays with Charles River CD&hyph; mice and Swiss-Webster mice; cytogenic assays (human lyphocytes
and bone marrow of Wistar rats); and micronucleus test in mice; Six DNA damage/repair assays including 

S. typhimurium

 (TA 1978 and TA 1538 strains), 

Saccaromyces cerervisiae

 (D4, JD1, and ``other'' strains); human embryo epithelial cells; rat hepatocytes in culture; and sister chromatid
exchange in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Paraquat was negative in eight studies (mostly in gene mutation and
chromosomal aberration assays); weakly positive in two gene mutation assays, one chromosomal aberration assay,
and one DNA damage/repair assay; and positive in four DNA damage/repair assays. 
The reference dose (RfD) based on the 1-year feeding study in dogs (NOEL of 0.45 mg/kg/ bwt/day) and an uncertainty
factor of 100 is calculated to be 0.0045 mg/kg/ bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) for
published tolerances is 1.9 X 10

3

 mg/kg bwt/day representing 42% of the RfD. The current action will utilize an additional 2% of the RfD. These tolerances
and the previously established tolerances utilize a total of 43% of the RfD for the total U.S. population. For the most
highly exposed U.S. subroup population, children 1 to 6 years of age, the current action and previously established
tolerances utilize 96% of the RfD assuming that residue levels are at tolerance levels and 100% of the crop is treated.

There are no desirable data lacking for this chemical. There are currently no actions pending against the continued
registration of this pesticide. The Agency (Peer Review Committee) initially classified paraquat as a ``C'' carcinogen
based on the significant increase in squamous cell carcinomas in the head region (ears, nasal cavity, oral cavity,
and skin) of the high-dose (7.5 mg/kg/day male, Fischer rats) in the chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study. Review
of the study by an independent laboratory concluded that the above tumor sites should not be combined. Without the
combination, there were no statistically significant tumor increases for any particular tumor type. The Agency
also considered two additional carcinogenicity studies (rat and mouse) and further evaluated the tumors. 
Based on a second peer review of paraquat, the Peer Review Committee, after reviewing all the evidence, concluded
that there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male Wistar rats at 12 mg/kg/day (HDT); in female Wistar rats at 15
mg/kg/day (HDT); in male and female JCL:ICR mice at 13 mg/kg/day (HDT); in male and female mice (SPF Swiss) derived
at 19 mg/kg/day (HDT). It was also concluded that there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male Fischer 344 rats
at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT). According to the EPA Carcinogenicity Guidelines, paraquat was, therefore, placed in Category
E (evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans), based on a lack of convincing evidence of carcinogenicity in adequate
studies with two animal species, rat and mouse. 
The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which these tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue in plants
and animals is adequately understood for the purpose of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology
(reflux extraction with sulfuric acid), cleanup on ion-exchange resin, reduction with sodium dithionite color
reagent and spectrophotometric color measurement) is available for enforcement purposes. The method is listed
in the Pesticide Analytical Manual II (PAM II). Any secondary residue occurring in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs will
be covered by existing tolerances on these commodities. 
Based on the information considered by the Agency, the Agency has determined that when used in accordance with good
agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180
would protect the public health. It is proposed, therefore, that the tolerances be established as set forth below.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number [PP 5F3188/P596]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;54, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or
establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

(b) Nomination and Supporting Information which affirms the nominee's wish to be considered for the scholarship;
provides biographical information about the nominee's background, interests and plans; and provides a statement
about the nominee's intent to enter an appropriate career in mathematics, the natural sciences, or an eligible engineering
discipline and specifies how the student's educational plan will provide preparation for that career. 

(c) Nominee's essay of 600 words or less, which is written by the student and relates to the student's chosen career.


(d) Three Independent Evaluation of Nominee forms. The nominee must secure a letter of recommendation from a faculty
member who can discuss the nominee's potential for a career in mathematics, the natural sciences, or an eligible engineering
discipline; a faculty member in the nominee's field of study; and another individual/faculty member who can attest
to the nominees potential. 

(e) Requests for the nominee's high school and college transcripts. 



&sect;2600.13 


Nomination Deadline. 



Institutions must submit complete nominations for Goldwater Scholarships postmarked by the published deadline
on the annual Bulletin of Information provided to all faculty representatives and nominees. Late or incomplete nominations
will not be considered. The deadline will normally fall on a Friday in mid-December. 



Subpart C_Selection of Scholars 



&sect;2600.20 


Review Panel. 



An independent review panel of academicians in the appropriate fields of study is appointed annually by the Foundation
to evaluate all valid nominations. The Panel identifies the most outstanding nominees from each state and recommends
them for consideration by the Foundation Board of Trustees. The number of students recommended from each state will
depend on the number and qualifications of the nominees from the 53 jurisdictions. 



&sect;2600.21 


Selection Criteria. 



Each nominee is evaluated on: 

(a) Demonstrated potential for and commitment to a career in mathematics, the natural sciences or eligible engineering
disciplines; 

(b) Outstanding academic performance. 



&sect;2600.22 


Final Selection. 



The Foundation Trustees meet to consider the recommendations made by the Review Panel. The total number of Scholars
to be selected is determined by the Trustees based on the amount of funds available each year. Due to the exceptional
quality of nominees, the number of scholars recommended by the review panel generally exceeds the number of affordable
scholarships. Scholars recommended by the review panel, but not selected as Goldwater Scholars, will be recognized
as Goldwater Scholarship Finalists. 



&sect;2600.23 


Notification. 



Subsequent to the deliberations of the Board of Trustees, all nominees and faculty representatives will be notified
in writing of the results of the scholarship competition. 



Subpart D_Payment of Scholarship Awards 



&sect;2600.30 


Requirements for Scholarship Payments. 



To be eligible to receive payments, a Goldwater Scholar must submit in writing: 

(a) An acceptance of the Scholarship Award; 

(b) Prior to the beginning of each academic term, a Payment Request Form, certified by the authorized financial officer
of the institution listing eligible expenses, and all scholarships from sources other than the Foundation. This

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA is proposing to revise the regulations pertaining to infectious substances, including regulated medical waste
(RMW), based on petitions for reconsideration and comments received following issuance of a final rule in December
1991, comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued in March 1993, and agency initiative.
RSPA is proposing to clarify that RMW is a subcategory of infectious substances; allow RMW to be offered for transportation
and transported if it conforms to certain requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; add
provisions for transporting RMW by aircraft; and make other changes to clarify the regulatory provisions applicable
to infectious substances. The proposed changes are intended to ensure the safe transportation of infectious substances,
provide relief from certain requirements of the hazardous materials regulations in those instances where other
Federal agency regulations achieve an acceptable level of safety for transportation of RMW, and clarify provisions
which were adopted in the December 1991 final rule. 



RSPA also is announcing a public meeting to solicit comments on the proposals contained in this document.

VII. Regulatory Analyses and Notices 



I. Background 




History of Department of Transportation Regulation of Etiologic Agents/Infectious Substances 



A. Regulation Prior to 1991



The Hazardous Materials Regulations Board (Board; a predecessor to the RSPA) adopted a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142
on September 30, 1972 (37 FR 20554), that added ``etiologic agents'' to the list of hazardous materials regulated
by the Secretary. The final rule at 49 CFR 173.386(a)(1) defined an etiologic agent as




a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease, and is limited to those agents listed
in 42 CFR 72.25(c) of the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. 




(The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is now the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)).
The final rule at 49 CFR 173.387 also specified packaging requirements for etiologic agents, and excepted, at 49 CFR
173.386(d), from DOT regulation ``diagnostic specimens'' and ``biological products,'' which were subject to regulation
by HEW. The final rule was adopted after notice and opportunity to comment (36 FR 25163, December 29, 1971). 



On November 29, 1972, after receiving two petitions for reconsideration and several comments, the Board proposed
in the 

Federal Register

 (37 FR 25243) to except from DOT regulation cultures of etiologic agents of less than 50 milliliters (1.666 fluid ounces)
in one package. The petitions stated that such an exception was necessary to allow physicians in rural areas to transport
cultures to laboratories on passenger-carrying aircraft, rather than by slower surface transportation which,
in turn, promotes health safety. The petitions added that cultures of etiologic agents may perish if in transportation
too long. The Board adopted the proposal as final on March 29, 1973 (38 FR 8161). One commenter objected to excepting
such quantities of etiologic agents from all regulation. The Board noted, however, that quantities of etiologic
agents excepted from DOT regulation would still be subject to HEW labeling and packaging regulations under 42 CFR
72.25(c). The March 29, 1973 rule also adopted incident notification requirements for etiologic agents, as proposed
on July 22, 1972 (37 FR 14728). 




B. The 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) under Docket HM&hyph;142A




On November 10, 1988, RSPA proposed (Docket HM&hyph;142A, 53 FR 45525) to revise the definition of ``etiologic agent,''
remove the 50 milliliter (ml) exception, and align the per package quantity limits of etiologic agents aboard aircraft
with the International Civil Aviation Organization Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous
Goods by Air (ICAO Technical Instructions). RSPA proposed broadening the definition of ``etiologic agent'' to include,
in addition to etiologic agents listed by DHHS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) in 42 CFR 72.3, any
agent that poses a similar degree of hazard, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). RSPA noted that the proposed
definition was not as broad as the definition for infectious substances (Division 6.2) contained in the United Nations
Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations) and international regulations based
on the UN Recommendations, such as the ICAO Technical Instructions. CDC has not updated the list in 42 CFR 72.3 since
July 1, 1980 (45 FR 48627). On March 2, 1990 (55 FR 7678), CDC proposed to delete the list from its regulations and adopt
criteria to define ``etiologic agent,'' but a final rule has not been published. 



C. January 3, 1991 final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142A




On January 3, 1991, RSPA published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 197) under Docket HM&hyph;142A. The final rule (1) adopted a revised definition of ``etiologic agent,'' (2)
removed the 50 ml exception, and (3) clarified quantity limitations for etiologic agents transported aboard aircraft.
``Etiologic agent'' was defined to mean




a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which is listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC] or which causes or
may cause severe, disabling or fatal human disease.





The definition adopted differed from the proposed definition in response to commenters who suggested that the language
of the definition be modified to better reflect agents that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety during
transportation. Accordingly, the wording was revised to include other agents that cause or may cause severe, disabling
or fatal human diseases in humans in addition to the agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the CDC regulations. In response
to comments, RSPA indicated in the preamble that it believed most medical waste is composed of material that does not
contain etiologic agents, either because it does not contain any infectious material or because the infectious material
does not meet the regulatory definition of etiologic agent. RSPA also stated that, in many cases, if medical waste
is known or suspected to contain an etiologic agent, it is treated on-site to destroy the agent by using a method such
as incineration, autoclaving, or treatment with disinfectants. However, RSPA clearly stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;*
if an infectious waste that contains an etiologic agent is offered for transportation, it must conform with the requirements
in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171&hyph;180) for etiologic agents'' (56 FR 198). As stated
earlier, the final rule also removed the 50 ml exception, as proposed in 1988. The January 3 preamble responded to numerous
comments received on the 50 ml proposal and comprehensively discussed the reasons for this action.

The January 3 preamble also discussed the relationship of Docket HM&hyph;142A to Docket HM&hyph;181. Docket HM&hyph;181,
entitled ``Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards; Miscellaneous Amendments,'' comprehensively revised
the HMR by eliminating 350 pages of regulation and harmonizing HMR requirements for classification, hazard communication
and packaging with standards in the UN Recommendations. In the preamble discussion, RSPA stated that HM&hyph;181
had proposed to replace the term ``etiologic agent'' with ``infectious substance'' for consistency with international
regulations. However, RSPA noted that the scope of changes proposed under HM&hyph;181 was so extensive that RSPA
was unsure when that proposal would be adopted as final. As a result, RSPA proceeded with a separate rulemaking under
Docket HM&hyph;142A (an abbreviated version of the infectious substance provisions in HM&hyph;181) to ensure that
the risks posed by etiologic agents were adequately regulated under the HMR. RSPA intended the provisions under HM&hyph;142A
to serve as a transition until the provisions of HM&hyph;181 became effective. Both final rules were published at
approximately the same time. However, the initial effective date for HM&hyph;142A was February 19, 1991, and the
effective date for HM&hyph;181 was October 1, 1991. Although HM&hyph;142A was to become effective before HM&hyph;181,
RSPA encouraged shippers to implement the HM&hyph;181 provisions as soon as practicable. 


D. Performance-oriented packaging standards_HM&hyph;181 


In 1987, RSPA proposed to align the classification, packaging, and hazard communications provisions in the HMR with
the UN Recommendations and the ICAO Technical Instructions. The May 5, 1987 NPRM (Docket HM&hyph;181, 52 FR 16482)
proposed to replace the term ``etiologic agent'' with the term ``infectious substance'' and adopt the INFECTIOUS
SUBSTANCE label (52 FR 16700). RSPA proposed to include ``infectious substance'' in UN classification Class 6, Division
6.2. ``Infectious substance'' was proposed to mean

 

a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease, and is limited to those agents listed
in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC]. The terms ``infectious substance'' and ``etiologic agent'' are synonymous.

 

(52 FR 16700). 


On December 21, 1990, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;181 (55 FR 52402) which comprehensively revised
the HMR with respect to hazard communication, classification, and packaging requirements. ``Infectious substance''
was defined in 49 CFR 173.134(a)(1) to mean

 

a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause disease in humans or animals, and includes those agents
listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC] or any other agent that has the potential to cause severe, disabling
or fatal disease. The terms ``infectious substance'' and ``etiologic agent'' are synonymous.

 

RSPA had planned to issue a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142A (etiologic agents) before issuing the final rule
under Docket HM&hyph;181. However, the final rule under HM&hyph;181 was issued on December 21, 1990, and the final
rule under HM&hyph;142A was not issued until January 3, 1991. As explained in the preamble to the January 3, 1991 rule,
the comments on HM&hyph;142A were considered in the decisionmaking process for HM&hyph;181, and reflected in the
December 21, 1990 rule. For example, not only did the December 1990 definition of ``infectious substance'' adopt
the broader definition of etiologic agent proposed in 1988, it also reflected RSPA's consideration of comments suggesting
that the language be modified to better define agents that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety during
transportation. 


A document incorporating editorial and substantive revisions to the December 1990 final rule was published on December
20, 1991 [56 FR 66124]. (These final rules are referred to jointly herein as Docket HM&hyph;181.) The revisions contained
in the December 1991 rule were primarily in response to petitions for reconsideration received on the December 1990
final rule. The December 1991 rule also made editorial and technical corrections to the December 21, 1990 final rule,
and to the January 3, 1991 final rule. 


E. Petition for reconsideration on the January 3, 1991 rule 


A petition for reconsideration filed by the National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) recommended that
RSPA revise the definition of infectious substances (etiologic agents) to exclude solid waste or medical waste as
defined in 40 CFR 259.10 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. To allow adequate time to evaluate
the petition, RSPA delayed the effective date of the January 3 rule to September 30, 1991 (February 22, 1991, 56 FR 7312).
In a meeting to obtain clarification of the petition, NSWMA urged RSPA to reestablish the 50 ml exception for infectious
substances. The NSWMA stated that RSPA's regulation was inconsistent with the approach taken by EPA, and would increase
the costs of transporting medical waste for the regulated community. The NSWMA stated that, contrary to RSPA's preamble
discussion that most medical waste did not contain etiologic agents or was treated on-site to destroy the agent before
being transported for disposal, substantial quantities of untreated medical waste are transported off-site. This
information was the first indication RSPA had received from any commenter that removal of the 50 ml exception would
affect a larger segment of the industry than had previously been indicated. 
On September 18, 1991 (56 FR 47158), RSPA incorporated HM&hyph;142A into HM&hyph;181 and, in partial response to
NSWMA's request, extended the 50 ml exception from October 1, 1991, to October 1, 1992. (The September 1991 rule also
required that packages exceeding the 50 ml exception comply on October 1, 1991, with the revised hazard communication
(shipping paper, marking, and labeling) and classification requirements in Docket HM&hyph;181). RSPA anticipated
that this extension would provide enough time to fully respond to NSWMA's comments in the final correction document
to HM&hyph;181 that was being prepared. However, NSWMA submitted a September 26, 1991 letter asking that RSPA clarify
that the January 3, 1991 and September 18, 1991 final rules ``apply to only isolated cultures or stocks such as clinical
laboratory specimens and not to 'medical waste' as defined in 40 CFR 259.30(a) and 'mixtures' as defined in 40 CFR 259.31.''
In essence, NSWMA was requesting clarification that the HMR did not apply to medical waste containing any amount of
an infectious substance. In order to allow RSPA additional time to carefully review NSWMA's substantive concerns,
RSPA again extended the compliance date for all new requirements for infectious substances until October 1, 1992
(October 1, 1991, 56 FR 49830).

F. December 20, 1991 final rule 


In the December 20, 1991 final rule responding to petitions for reconsideration in Docket HM&hyph;181, RSPA agreed
with NSWMA that medical waste containing an infectious substance should be treated differently than other infectious
substances. RSPA had no basis, however, to except from regulation medical waste containing an infectious substance,
and stated ``*&blank;*&blank;* since the majority of these wastes are untreated and, thus, may potentially contain
infectious substances, RSPA strongly believes that the public and transport personnel be protected from the hazards
of these materials during transportation'' (56 FR 66142). Accordingly, RSPA revised the regulations (49 CFR 173.197
(1991)) to specify ``*&blank;*&blank;* less rigorous requirements for infectious substances that are `regulated
medical wastes''' (56 FR 66131). RSPA observed that EPA's regulations on medical waste in 40 CFR Part 259 had applied
in only five States and had expired on June 22, 1991, with the end of a 2-year demonstration program that EPA had established
under the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (MWTA; Pub.L. 100&hyph;582). To provide less rigorous requirements
for medical waste containing infectious substances, RSPA turned to the expired EPA regulations as a model that could
be adapted, with some modifications, to the HMR. RSPA wanted to take advantage of the technical expertise and knowledge
of the medical waste industry that EPA had developed during its demonstration project under the MWTA. Accordingly,
RSPA adopted a definition of ``regulated medical waste'' (to distinguish between all medical waste and medical waste
containing an infectious substance) and specified packaging requirements for regulated medical waste (RMW) that
were consistent with those contained in the expired EPA regulations. 
RSPA thus identified a subcategory of Division 6.2 (infectious substances) materials, i.e., RMW, which is an infectious
substance that is contained in or constitutes medical waste, and provided packaging requirements for RMW that were
less rigorous than those for other infectious substances. 
Under the December 1991 rule, if an infectious substance is offered for transportation or transported, the infectious
substance must be labeled, packaged, and offered for transportation in accordance with the HMR, unless it meets one
of the exceptions from regulation. The 1991 rule provided that if the infectious substance was a medical waste, or
was contained in medical waste, then a shipper could use the less rigorous packaging requirements that were provided
for RMW. 
If RSPA had not provided this measure of regulatory relief in response to petitions, all infectious substances, regardless
of how they are generated, would be classified and described as Division 6.2 materials, and would be subject to the
full extent of regulation provided in the HMR. 


G. Petitions for reconsideration and comments received in response to the December 20, 1991 rule 


Following issuance of the December 1991 rule, RSPA received additional petitions for reconsideration and a number
of requests for clarification and additional comments concerning the provisions for infectious substances and
regulated medical waste. The petitioners requested a stay in the effectiveness of the final rule and the reopening
of the rulemaking for additional public input. 
Petitions were submitted by the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Association for Practitioners in Infection
Control, Inc. (APIC), and the Conference on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Articles, Inc. (COSTHA). The petitioners
asserted that RSPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553; ``APA'') by adopting new requirements
for medical waste in the December 20, 1991 rule without providing an opportunity for comment; did not adequately assess
the risks associated with RMW in transportation and the costs and benefits of regulation; and did not coordinate with
other Federal agencies to prevent imposition of conflicting regulations. 
Petitioners also contended that the RMW requirements in the HMR conflict with information contained in the report
entitled ``The Public Health Implications on Medical Waste: A Report to Congress,'' prepared in 1990 by the Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) on the Medical Waste Tracking Act. The ATSDR Report contains a compilation
of information obtained from several State health and environmental departments on the amount and types of medical
waste generated and health and environmental implications of medical waste in the United States. The report concludes
that infection outside the health care setting is not likely, and public health is not likely to be adversely affected
by medical waste in transportation. 
COSTHA also asserted that RSPA changed the definition of infectious substances to include substances ``infectious
to animals only'' without providing an opportunity to comment.

H. Advance notice of proposed rulemaking


On March 3, 1993, RSPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) and announced a public meeting under
Docket HM&hyph;181G (58 FR 12207) concerning the issues raised by petitioners and commenters and the need for additional
regulatory changes pertaining to infectious substances. In order to provide time to evaluate the comments received
in response to the ANPRM, RSPA also extended the compliance date (58 FR 12182) for provisions applicable to infectious
substances from April 1, 1993, to January 1, 1994. The ANPRM addressed a number of complex issues pertaining to scope
of regulation, consistency with regulations of other agencies, the need for revised standards for non-bulk and bulk
packagings, and defining criteria for infectious substances and RMW. Following issuance of the ANPRM, RSPA continued
its efforts to gain information on other Federal agencies' regulatory requirements, and hosted and participated
in a number of interagency meetings on these issues. On December 20, 1993 (58 FR 66302), RSPA again extended the compliance
date for provisions applicable to infectious substances from January 1, 1994, to October 1, 1994 to provide additional
time for resolving the issues of concern. 


II. Final Rule Extending Compliance Dates 


In a final rule published on September 22, 1994 (59 FR 48762), RSPA revised 49 CFR 171.14(b) to once again delay compliance
dates. For regulatory requirements for RMW and for materials infectious only to animals, the compliance date was
extended from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995. This time period should be adequate for RSPA to evaluate comments
received in response to this Notice, and make any necessary changes to the HMR based on the merits of those comments.

For other infectious substances, e.g., for cultures and stocks of substances infectious to humans, the compliance
date was extended from October 1, 1994, to January 1, 1995. The provisions for these materials generally were not at
issue in comments or petitions to the December 1991 final rule. The principal effects of the January 1, 1995 compliance
date will be a nomenclature change from the old ``etiologic agent'' hazard class to the new Division 6.2 (infectious
substances) classification, broadening the definition of infectious substances to cover substances, such as the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Lyme disease, which are not listed in the CDC regulations (42 CFR 72.3). The
removal of the 50 ml exception and expansion of the definition of infectious substances originally were to have occurred
on February 19, 1991 (Docket HM&hyph;142A; January 3, 1991; 56 FR 197). RSPA believes it is necessary to implement
these requirements as quickly as possible to ensure public safety and end confusion as to the status of materials that
were not regulated prior to 1990. The interested reader is directed to the final rule for further information concerning
the extension of compliance dates. 


III. Response to Petitions for Reconsideration 


With respect to the issue of providing notice and comment, the December 20, 1991 final rule was issued to correct obvious
errors and respond to over 250 petitions for reconsideration of the final rule published on December 21, 1990. The
rulemaking proceeding under HM&hyph;181 spanned over 10 years, provided numerous opportunities for public comment
(with over 2,500 comments received), and complied fully with the requirements of the APA. Similarly, the final rule
issued under HM&hyph;142A was preceded by an NPRM and opportunity to comment. 
The specific criteria and provisions for medical waste were contained in the December 20, 1991 final rule to provide
relief from the more burdensome infectious substances packaging requirements adopted in the December 21, 1990 final
rule. Relief was provided in response to petitions for reconsideration stating that packaging prescribed in &sect;173.196
would be both cost-prohibitive and impractical for medical waste and that, rather than being treated on-site, significant
quantities of medical waste containing infectious substances were routinely transported off-site for treatment
or disposal. The relief granted for medical waste was well within the scope of the NPRM and the final rule. 
Infectious substances, including medical waste containing infectious substances, are regulated under the HMR
and have been since 1973. For various reasons, many generators and transporters of medical waste may not have been
fully aware of these requirements. The change in the definition of an etiologic agent/infectious substance under
Dockets HM&hyph;142A and HM&hyph;181, coupled with the elimination of the 50 ml exception, increased both the awareness
of this issue and the likelihood that more medical waste would be subject to the HMR. Moreover, the petitions appeared
to be based on a misconception that RSPA intended to regulate all medical waste, rather than only that medical waste
containing an infectious substance. To the extent that there existed any confusion regarding the scope of RSPA's
regulation of medical waste, the notice published today sets forth a proposed definition of RMW that clearly limits
RMW to a waste containing an infectious substance. Accordingly, in this notice, RSPA is giving those persons who may
have been unaware of, or confused by, the previous requirements an opportunity to comment on the proposals. 

With regard to analysis of risk and economic impact, in the regulatory evaluation for HM&hyph;181, RSPA performed
a macroscopic analysis of costs and benefits generically addressing all hazardous materials, their packagings,
and impacts of changes to classification and hazard communication. The HMR address tens of thousands of hazardous
materials and over 100 different types of packagings. Under HM&hyph;181, it was not feasible or necessary to specifically
analyze each hazardous material or category of materials or each type of packaging and determine that the benefits
of change to classification, hazard communication or packaging for each would outweigh associated costs. The benefits
of the system put in place under HM&hyph;181, involving the assessment of levels of hazard for materials and assignment
of packagings based on levels of hazard, were demonstrated to greatly exceed the costs of the system. RSPA did not receive
any comments in response to the notices in Dockets HM&hyph;181 or HM&hyph;142A on any economic impacts the rule would
have on the medical waste industry. Therefore, RSPA disagrees with the petitioners who claimed that RSPA did not adequately
assess costs and benefits attributable to changes to regulatory requirements, particularly with regard to medical
waste. For this notice, RSPA has prepared a regulatory evaluation and is providing an opportunity to comment on the
proposals.

With respect to other Federal regulation of infectious substances, RSPA has participated in a number of interagency
meetings to exchange information on the Federal regulations and identify any duplication, conflict, gaps, or discrepancies.
As discussed in greater detail under Section VI of this notice, RSPA intends to continue to cooperate with other Federal
agencies to harmonize requirements on infectious substances. With respect to State regulation, RSPA is aware that
many States have regulations on the transportation of medical waste, although the States vary in the extent and scope
of their regulation. As discussed in Section VII.B. below, Federal law preempts State requirements applicable to
the transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not substantively the same as the Federal
requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These subjects include the designation, description, classification, packaging,
handling, marking, and labeling of hazardous material. 
With respect to the ATSDR Report, that report addressed all medical waste generated in the United States. RSPA is concerned
only with regulating medical waste that contains an infectious substance, and is proposing to regulate only that
medical waste. 
With respect to COSTHA's petition concerning substances infectious only to animals, in the November 1987 NPRM under
Docket HM&hyph;181, RSPA had proposed a shipping description for ``Infectious substances, 

affecting animals only

'', applicable only to international transportation (i.e., identified with an ``I'' in Column 1 of the Hazardous
Materials Table in &sect;172.101). In the December 1990 final rule, RSPA removed the ``I'', making the description
applicable to both domestic and international transportation, and revised the definition for infectious substances
to include those affecting animals only. This action was taken to harmonize with the UN Recommendations to the maximum
extent practicable. In response to COSTHA's petition, RSPA is providing notice and opportunity to comment on the
proposal in this NPRM. 


Conclusion 


By initiating rulemaking, including issuance of the ANPRM and this NPRM, RSPA has granted the petitioners' requests
to provide notice and an opportunity to comment on provisions concerning RMW and infectious substances that are infectious
to animals only. RSPA agrees with the petitioners and commenters that the HMR should be carefully tailored to the hazards
posed by these materials, so that they can be safely transported without imposing unreasonable requirements on industry.
To the maximum extent practicable, RSPA is proposing to accommodate RMW prepared in accordance with other Federal
regulations, as discussed in Section V of this notice. Furthermore, RSPA is proposing to amend and clarify certain
provisions that are frequently misconstrued. 


IV. General Summary of the ANPRM 


The ANPRM was issued to invite interested persons to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting views and
information on issues concerning Division 6.2 materials. RSPA asked 29 questions in the ANPRM. The questions addressed
areas in the HMR that were identified as problem areas in comments and petitions received following issuance of the
December 1991 final rule. RSPA requested information on a number of complex issues including the burdens of compliance
with the HMR and other Federal regulations, the need for revised packaging standards, the need to expand or narrow
the definitions for infectious substances and RMW, and the costs incurred to manage these materials in transportation.
RSPA requested commenters to provide as much quantitative information as was available concerning costs and benefits
attributable to their recommendations. 
RSPA received approximately 54 written comments in response to the ANPRM and 13 oral comments at the public meeting.
Comments were submitted by a variety of organizations, including associations representing hospitals, blood centers
and laboratories, disposal service companies, Federal and State agencies, packaging manufacturers, and private
individuals. In responding to the ANPRM, some commenters submitted views on issues not specifically addressed in
the ANPRM. 
The commenters provided widely divergent views on the extent to which the regulations should be revised or amended.
Some commenters believed that RSPA should adopt a ``universal precautions'' approach, as utilized by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor in regulations applicable to bloodborne pathogens
(29 CFR 1910.1030); that is, all materials that are potentially infectious are treated as if known to be infectious.
Others suggested that RSPA should withdraw from regulation of infectious substances and RMW, asserting that other
agencies' regulations provide an adequate level of safety in transportation. Several commenters claimed that the
regulation of RMW was best left to the EPA, even though EPA regulation of RMW ended in 1991. 
Several commenters provided information on the overall quantities and costs of disposal for medical waste. However,
there was not much useful information as to what portion of that waste stream was subject to RSPA requirements, either
before or after the HM&hyph;181 final rules, incremental costs or savings resulting from the December 1991 final
rule, or even what portion of the disposal costs were the result of regulatory requirements. Commenters estimated
varying disposal costs from $0.10 to $2.00 per pound.

V. Proposed Rule 


After considering the comments and petitions for reconsideration that were filed, and following an examination
of the issues surrounding the transportation of infectious substances and RMW, RSPA is limiting the proposals in
this notice to those issues concerning infectious substances and RMW that must be addressed in the short term to ensure
safe transportation of these materials without unduly impacting the regulated industry. RSPA intends to address
other pertinent issues, such as harmonizing the HMR with international regulations, adopting bulk packaging provisions
for RMW, and evaluating the adequacy of existing Federal regulations for biological products and diagnostic specimens,
in future rulemaking action. Although these issues are important, they are complex and may result in additional requirements
or substantial changes to the HMR. Thus, it is not appropriate to include them in this notice, except to discuss them
in terms of future action. The ``long-term'' issues are discussed further in Section VI of this notice.
 
In this NPRM, RSPA is proposing to amend the provisions of the HMR applicable to Division 6.2 materials to enhance the
effectiveness of the HMR and minimize costs incurred by industry. Interested persons are invited to comment on these
proposals. A public meeting will be held on January 17, 1995, at which oral comments are invited. 



A. Definitions 


Several commenters requested confirmation of their understanding that the provisions for RMW do not apply to sterilized
medical wastes or wastes that do not contain an infectious substance. This understanding is correct. As stated in
the preamble to the January 3, 1991 final rule, if a medical waste has been treated so as to eliminate its hazard as an
infectious substance, then it is not subject to the HMR. No additional processing of the waste for aesthetics, such
as that formerly required by the EPA under the MWTA, is required. To clarify this point, RSPA is proposing to revise
&sect;173.134 by adding exceptions for any material that contained an infectious substance but has been treated
to eliminate the hazard. In addition, consistent with EPA-provided exceptions under the MWTA regulations and based
on RSPA's own initiative, RSPA is proposing to clarify that the following materials are not considered RMW: (1) EPA
hazardous wastes; (2) household waste; (3) corpses, remains, and anatomical parts intended for ceremonial interment
or cremation, and (4) animal waste generated in animal husbandry or food production. 

Based on commenters' requests and RSPA's initiative, RSPA is proposing to simplify the definition of RMW by adopting
a criteria-based definition, rather than a list-based definition. The definition in Appendix G to part 173 did not
specify that a category of waste, such as ``unused sharps,'' was only regulated if the waste contained an infectious
substance. RSPA never intended to regulate medical waste that does not contain an infectious substance. Therefore,
RSPA is proposing to revise the definition of RMW to remove the Appendix G categories and replace them with a generic
definition. RMW would be defined as a waste or reusable material, other than a Class 7 (radioactive) material or a culture
or stock of an infectious substance, which contains an infectious substance and is generated in the diagnosis, treatment
or immunization of human beings or animals, research pertaining thereto, or the production or testing of biological
products. 

Another issue of concern to RSPA was whether waste cultures and stocks should be treated as RMW or as infectious substances
for the purposes of packaging and hazard communication for transportation. Several commenters recommended that
waste cultures and stocks should be treated as infectious substances rather than as RMW. One commenter stated that
the hazards posed by these materials are the same regardless of ``whether the untreated cultures and stocks are to
undergo further manipulation or are destined for disposal.'' Another commenter stated that cultures and stocks
demand very careful packaging and handling. The commenter added that packagings required for most RMW are not adequate
for untreated cultures and stocks. Some commenters stated that cultures and stocks should be handled as RMW because
optimal conditions for growth are no longer present in the waste stream and most of these materials are sterilized
before transportation. In the case of the generators that cannot sterilize on-site, the Texas Water Commission asserted
that the quantity of these materials in the waste stream is probably insufficient to make the waste significantly
more infectious than other forms of RMW.

RSPA agrees with those commenters who suggested that discarded cultures and stocks, because of their concentration,
pose a greater degree of risk than other medical waste and should be treated as infectious substances rather than RMW.
Therefore, RSPA is proposing to exclude untreated waste cultures and stocks from the definition of RMW and subject
them to the more rigorous packaging provisions applicable to infectious substances other than RMW. RSPA does not
believe that this proposal will impose additional burdens on industry because, based on comments, these materials
are largely treated on-site prior to disposal. 

RSPA received comments stating that contaminated laundry and other recyclable/reusable materials, such as used
surgical instruments that are cleaned and sterilized off-site, should be handled in accordance with OSHA regulations.
The OSHA regulations in 29 CFR 1910.1030 provide that contaminated laundry shall be placed and transported in bags
or containers labeled or color-coded in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the OSHA regulations or, if utilizing
universal precautions, alternative labeling is permitted if it is recognizable to all employees as requiring compliance
with universal precautions. In addition, OSHA requires contaminated laundry that is wet and presents a reasonable
likelihood of soak-through of or leakage from the bag or container to be placed in bags or containers which prevent
soak-through and/or leakage of fluids to the exterior. One commenter stated that since these waste materials are
not considered hazardous wastes under EPA regulations, they should not be RMW under DOT regulations. The American
Type Culture Collection suggested that laundry and surgical instruments should only be regulated in transportation
if they are known to be infectious. To relieve the burden of dual compliance with the HMR and OSHA regulations, RSPA
is proposing to except contaminated laundry and other reusable materials from the HMR if they are handled in accordance
with the OSHA requirements in 29 CFR 1910.1030. 

In the ANPRM, RSPA reopened the issue of regulating infectious substances affecting animals only. Several commenters
objected to regulating substances ``infectious to animals only.'' Commenters suggested that RSPA include only
those substances infectious to humans and those infectious to humans and animals (zoonotic), but not those infectious
to animals only. Some commenters stated that the regulations of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
of the United States Department of Agriculture adequately covers substances infectious to animals. One commenter
suggested that if RSPA defers to other regulations for these materials, the HMR should cross-reference those Federal
regulations. 

Under the Federal hazardous material transportation law, RSPA must regulate the transportation of materials that
may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property. Animal pathogens may pose an unreasonable risk to animals.
Furthermore, RSPA has examined the APHIS regulations contained in 9 CFR parts 1&hyph;199 and determined that they
do not address transportation concerns with regard to communication of hazard, provision of emergency response
information, and adequacy of packaging. Therefore, in this notice, RSPA is proposing to regulate Division 6.2 materials
affecting animals only. Although the requirements that were scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1994, included
``animals'' in the definition of ``infectious substance,'' RSPA has delayed the compliance date for these materials
until October 1, 1995. See Section II for more information concerning the extension of compliance dates. RSPA is requesting
more comments on this issue. 

RSPA received several requests to clarify that the terms ``biological product'' and ``diagnostic specimen'' do
not include materials that do not contain infectious substances. As previously stated, RSPA does not intend to regulate
materials that do not pose a hazard in transportation. Therefore, for clarity, RSPA is proposing to revise the definitions
of ``biological product'' and ``diagnostic specimen'' to include only those materials that contain an infectious
substance. RSPA also would clarify that the terms ``biological product,'' ``diagnostic specimen,'' and ``regulated
medical waste'' are all subcategories of Division 6.2 materials.

B. RMW Exception 



RSPA received several comments on the ANPRM claiming that the regulations imposed by RSPA overlap, and sometimes
conflict with, regulations/guidelines established by other agencies, which unnecessarily increases costs and
confusion. One commenter suggested that inconsistencies should be eliminated between Federal and State regulations
governing RMW. Another commenter stated that overlapping regulations clearly increase non-compliance; however,
the associated costs are difficult to assess. One commenter asserted that current Federal regulations do not appear
to be financially burdensome but do complicate compliance. One commenter claimed that overlapping Federal regulations
are not so much burdensome or costly, as that they are largely ignored. Another commenter stated that varying medical
waste regulations increase the volume of waste that must be specially handled. Many commenters requested consolidation
of the regulations. 

More specifically, commenters stated that the appearance of multiple labels on a package of infectious substances
causes unnecessary confusion to transport workers and emergency responders. One commenter claimed that multiple
labels contribute to the mismanagement of medical waste by transport workers and emergency response personnel.
Several commenters recommended that one label is sufficient to communicate the hazard. One commenter suggested
that the CDC ``BIOMEDICAL MATERIAL'' label and the OSHA ``BIOHAZARD'' marking should be allowed only on stationary
materials and equipment. Some commenters recommended that RSPA adopt the UN Recommendations label for infectious
substances because it is internationally recognized. One commenter stated that appropriate worker training would
eliminate much of the confusion experienced by transport workers and emergency response personnel. 

RSPA recognizes that overlapping Federal regulations for infectious substances and RMW cause confusion and result
in frustrated shipments. Therefore, RSPA is proposing to provide an exception from the HMR labeling and packaging
requirements for RMW, transported by private and contract carriers, that is packaged in a packaging that complies
with OSHA requirements, is rigid, conforms to the general packaging requirements of 49 CFR 173.24 and 173.24a, and
is marked with the OSHA ``BIOHAZARD'' marking. This exception would be limited to transport by private or contract
carrier because these carriers generally transport RMW exclusively and have the demonstrated ability to implement
appropriate handling procedures which offset potentially lesser packaging integrity. RMW that is offered for transportation
and transported by common carrier would be subject to the packaging requirements of &sect;173.197. 
RSPA invites comments on this matter. 

Other than this exception for RMW, RSPA is not proposing in this NPRM to accept other agencies' labels or markings in
place of the label or marking requirements for infectious substances packagings. The ``INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE''
label is internationally recognized, is required under the ICAO Technical Instructions for transport by aircraft,
and is consistent in size and appearance with DOT's other hazard warning labels. Unlike OSHA's ``BIOHAZARD'' marking,
the DOT label conveys the class number of the material, emergency information in the event of a spill or incident, and
has minimum size requirements to ensure its visibility. 




C. Miscellaneous 



RSPA is proposing to relocate the exceptions for biological products and diagnostic specimens in &sect;173.196
and the definition and exceptions for RMW in Appendix G to part 173 to &sect;173.134 to ease compliance. Also, in response
to a question concerning use of the term ``diagnostic specimen'' versus ``clinical specimen,'' many commenters
recommended that RSPA continue using ``diagnostic specimen'' instead of ``clinical specimen'' because the term
``diagnostic specimen'' is commonly used in industry. RSPA agrees and would retain the terminology. RSPA is proposing
to amend the terminology used in the incident reporting requirements in &sect;171.15 from ``etiologic agents''
to ``infectious substances (etiologic agents)''. 

RSPA has received several requests for clarification as to whether infectious substance packagings that successfully
pass the tests in &sect;178.609 must be certified and marked. According to &sect;173.196, packagings for infectious
substances are required to be capable of passing the tests in &sect;178.609. These packagings are not required to
be marked and certified. RSPA is proposing to add a provision in &sect;178.609 that clarifies that packagings conforming
to this section are not subject to the marking requirements of &sect;173.503. However, the eighth revised edition
of the UN Recommendations prescribes packaging certification marking requirements for infectious substances
packagings. Therefore, RSPA may propose similar requirements in the interest of international harmonization,
in future rulemaking action. (See Section VI of this notice.) 

RSPA would clarify in &sect;173.134 that Division 6.2 materials other than RMW are not assigned a packing group. RMW
would be assigned to a Packing Group II performance level. 



D. Air Transportation 



In response to a question in the ANPRM, RSPA received comments concerning shipments of RMW by modes other than highway.
Commenters stated that RMW is transported predominantly by highway; however, other modes of transportation also
are used. Some commenters reported that used sharps are transported by air through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)
``mail-in'' sharps program. RSPA received a petition requesting an amendment to the HMR to permit the transportation
of similar quantities and packages of RMW by aircraft other than in mail. RSPA also received comments from a number
of health care facilities located in rural areas, e.g., Alaska, requesting that the regulations facilitate transportation
of medical wastes by aircraft. The commenters stated that health clinics in remote areas are only accessible by air
or water. Commenters reported that it is not practical for the air carriers to provide cargo-only flights.

<DOCNO> FR941221-1-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941221-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

RSPA is proposing to add two special provisions that would permit the transportation of RMW by aircraft. A new Special
Provision ``A13'' would be added to allow the transportation of sharps aboard passenger and cargo-carrying aircraft
in quantities of not more than 16 kilograms (35 pounds) per package and maximum liquid content of 50 milliliters for
each inner packaging. This provision is consistent with USPS regulations for the mailability of used sharps under
39 CFR Part 111 and would serve to eliminate confusion as to whether sharps mailers are acceptable for air transportation.
RSPA also is proposing to add Special Provision ``A14'' to allow shipments of RMW to be transported by aircraft in quantities
not exceeding 16 kilograms (35 pounds) for solid waste and 12 liters (3 gallons) for liquid waste, when means of transportation
other than air are impracticable or unavailable. Even though these provisions would not have any effect on the movement
of RMW until adopted, proposal of these provisions is intended to clarify that sharps and RMW from Alaska and other
remote areas are permitted aboard aircraft. See Section VI of this preamble for possible future rulemaking concerning
quantity limitations aboard aircraft. 

RSPA also is proposing to revise the I.D. number for RMW from a domestic-only recognized I.D. number (NA 9275) to an
internationally recognized I.D. number (UN 3291). This proposed amendment is consistent with the UN Recommendations
and the ICAO Technical Instructions. 



E. Proposed Extension of Compliance Date 



RSPA intended to issue this notice of proposed rulemaking simultaneously with the final rule which was published
on September 22, 1994 (see Section II of this notice). Due to a delay in publication of this notice, RSPA is proposing
to extend the compliance date once again for requirements applicable to regulated medical waste and infectious substances
affecting only animals from October 1, 1995, to January 1, 1996. This is intended to allow sufficient time for the public
to comment on the proposals contained in this notice, for RSPA to evaluate the comments received, and, based on the
merits of the comments, publish a final rule. RSPA invites comments on the need for this proposed extension. 




VI. Scope of Future Work 



RSPA believes that uniform standards, applicable to both domestic and international transportation, are essential
to ensuring the safe and efficient movement of infectious substances. To this end, RSPA continues to work with other
Federal agencies and the United Nations Subcommittee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods to improve standards
for classification, hazard communication, packaging and operational control of infectious substances. The HMR
are generally consistent with the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations),
although there are some differences. RSPA anticipates proposing changes to the HMR in future rulemaking concerning
defining criteria, particularly the adoption of risk groups and regulation of genetically-modified organisms
and microorganisms, and new shipping descriptions and marking requirements for non-bulk packagings based on the
UN Recommendations. 

The ICAO Technical Instructions prescribe no air quantity limits for RMW. RSPA may propose to align its air quantity
limits for RMW with the ICAO in future rulemaking action. 

Transportation safety for all categories of infectious substances (i.e., cultures and stocks, diagnostic specimens,
biological products containing infectious substances, and RMW) could be enhanced through imposition of uniform
classification, hazard communication and packaging requirements. Both through rulemaking action and in working
with other Federal agencies, RSPA anticipates advocating standards based on UN Recommendations, such as for the
internationally-recognized ``INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE'' label and for performance-oriented packaging. 

RSPA intends to continue its review of the HMR and the regulations of other Federal agencies and to work with these agencies
to identify and eliminate inconsistencies, overlaps, gaps and inadequacies in regulatory coverage. Although RSPA
is aware of allegations of inconsistent regulations, RSPA has not identified any regulatory impediment to compliance
with the HMR and the regulations of other agencies.

There are obvious overlaps between agency regulations, such as differing labeling and packaging requirements of
RSPA and the CDC for cultures and stocks of infectious substances. CDC has expressed a willingness to work with RSPA
in resolving these differences through changes to one or both agencies' regulations. There also are differing labeling
and packaging requirements of RSPA and OSHA for medical waste as discussed in the proposed rule change elsewhere in
this notice. Although compliance with two or more differing agencies' regulations may be burdensome, RSPA has not
identified any situation where compliance with one agency's regulations is a barrier to compliance with another
agency's regulations. However, RSPA agrees with commenters' contentions that differing requirements cause confusion
and increase compliance costs and the likelihood of non-compliance based on misunderstanding. RSPA intends to work
with other Federal agencies to eliminate overlaps, where feasible. 

Of more concern to RSPA than overlapping requirements are gaps or inadequacies of regulation which may impact transportation
safety. RSPA is particularly concerned that diagnostic specimens and biological products known or suspected to
contain infectious substances may be transported with inadequate or no hazard communication (e.g., shipping paper
descriptions identifying them as hazardous, package markings and labels to identify the hazard class and name of
the hazardous material, emergency response information specifying steps to be taken in the event of an incident in
transportation) and may be transported in packagings which are inadequate for the conditions of transport and the
risks posed by the materials contained therein. 

RSPA recognizes that the regulations under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Department of Health and
Human Services (21 CFR parts 312 and 600&hyph;680) and APHIS of the United States Department of Agriculture (9 CFR
parts 102&hyph;104) are designed to protect the safety, potency, and purity of the biological product and are not
specifically intended to protect transport workers or the public against exposure to biological products. RSPA
also understands that CDC regulations in 42 CFR 72.3 govern packaging and labeling for diagnostic specimens that
are equivalent to the HMR for infectious substances. However, regulatory gaps may exist in CDC's regulations because
the list of agents is outdated. For example, the list does not include HIV or Lyme disease. 

Because of the need for expeditious delivery, many biological products and diagnostic specimens are transported
by aircraft. Although not subject to incident reporting requirements of the HMR, RSPA understands that packages
of these materials often are damaged in transit aboard aircraft, causing costly delays and posing risks to cargo handlers,
emergency responders, others who may be exposed to the materials and property. Although many commenters to the ANPRM
on this issue supported regulation of these materials under the HMR, RSPA is not proposing to impose requirements
on biological products and diagnostic specimens at this time. RSPA would continue to except biological products
and diagnostic specimens from the HMR. RSPA anticipates proposing deletion of exceptions for these materials, if
justified in terms of benefits versus costs, in future rulemaking action. Other exceptions, such as those for hazardous
wastes, may be reconsidered at a future date if safety concerns warrant. 

RSPA would authorize, by today's proposed rule, non-bulk, non-specification packagings for RMW under specified
conditions. RSPA intends to monitor closely incident reports for these shipments to ensure that the packaging and
handling requirements achieve an acceptable level of safety and, if not, will propose adjustments in future rulemaking
action. 

Several other issues may be considered in future rulemaking action. Although no bulk packagings for RMW are specified
in the HMR, their use is authorized under the provisions of a number of exemptions. RSPA anticipates proposing to convert
the provisions of some or all of these exemptions into regulations of general applicability. RSPA currently requires
the segregation of poisons from foodstuffs. There may be sufficient justification, in terms of safety, to impose
similar restrictions on all infectious substances or RMW only. RSPA is aware that a number of States have differing
vehicle marking requirements for vehicles containing RMW. Although RSPA has not required a vehicle marking to date,
there may be a need to propose one. Finally, in the interest of minimizing cost impacts on the regulated industry, RSPA
did not adopt vehicle placarding requirements for Division 6.2 materials. For purposes of emergency response and
international harmonization, it may be beneficial to adopt an ``INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE'' placard in future rulemaking
action. 



VII. Regulatory Analyses and Notices 



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This proposed rule is considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and,
therefore, was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule is significant under the Regulatory Policies
and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034), because of substantial public interest. A regulatory
evaluation is available for review in the docket. 



B. Executive Order 12612



This proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 (``Federalism''). Federal law expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements applicable
to the transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not substantively the same as the
Federal requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These subjects are: 

(A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous material; 

(B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material; 

(C) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous material and requirements
respecting the number, content, and placement of those documents; 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941221-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941221-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
material; or 

(E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container which is 
represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous material. 

This proposed rule concerns the classification, packaging, labeling, and handling of hazardous material, among
other covered subjects. 

If adopted as final, this rule would preempt any State, local, or Indian tribe requirements concerning these subjects
unless the non-Federal requirements are ``substantively the same'' (see 49 CFR 107.202(d)) as the Federal requirements.


Federal law (49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(2)) provides that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects
after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the 

Federal Register

 the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA requests comments on what
the effective date of Federal preemption should be for the requirements in this proposed rule that concern covered
subjects. 



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act



This proposed rule would revise the requirements for infectious substances and regulated medical waste contained
in the HMR by narrowing the scope of these provisions. The proposed changes in this rule would provide relief to shippers,
carriers of infectious substances and regulated medical waste, and some packaging manufacturers, some of whom are
small entities (e.g., medical clinics, governmental jurisdictions, and not-for-profit organizations). Therefore,
I certify that this proposal will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This certification is subject to modification as a result of a review of comments received in response
to this proposal. 



D. Paperwork Reduction Act



There are no new information collection requirements in this proposed rule. 



E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN)



A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN numbers contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the
Unified Agenda.

 Proposed rule and request for comment.



 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed amendment to 40 CFR part 136 would approve the use of an 
additional procedure for the determination of chlorinated pesticides and PCBs in 
wastewater by adding appropriate citations to Tables IC and ID and by amending 
the incorporation by reference section of the regulation accordingly. The 
proposed method differs from currently approved methods in that the proposed 
method incorporates a disk of octadecyl bonded silica enmeshed in a matrix of 
inert PFTE fibrils for extraction of the analytes. The precision and recovery 
for the chlorinated pesticides and PCBs using this technique are not 
substantially different from those obtained using the liquid-liquid extraction 
technique already approved. Use of approved analytical techniques is required 
whenever the waste constituent specified is required to be measured for: an NPDES permit application; discharge
monitoring reports; state certification; and other requests from the permitting authority for quantitative or
qualitative effluent data. Use of approved test procedures is also required for the expression of pollutant amounts,
characteristics, or properties in effluent limitations guidelines and standards of performance and pretreatment
standards, unless otherwise specifically noted or defined.

&bull;Recommendation for Nationwide Approval from the Director, 
Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory-Cincinnati. 



I. Authority 


This proposed regulation is issued under authority of sections 301, 304(h) 
and 501(a) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

 (the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 as amended) (the ``Act''). Section 301 of the Act prohibits the discharge
of any pollutant into navigable waters unless the discharge complies with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit, issued under section 402. Section 304(h) of the Act requires the Administrator of the EPA to
``promulgate guidelines establishing test procedures for the analysis of pollutants that shall include the factors
which must be provided in any certification pursuant to section 401 of this Act or permit application pursuant to section
402 of this Act''. Section 501(a) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to ``prescribe such regulations as are necessary
to carry out his functions under this Act''. 


II. Regulatory Background 


The CWA establishes two principal bases for effluent limitations. First, 
existing discharges are required to meet technology-based effluent limitations. New source discharges must meet
new source performance standards based on the best available demonstrated control technology. Second, where necessary,
additional requirements are imposed to assure attainment and maintenance of water quality standards established
by the States under section 303 of the CWA. In establishing or reviewing NPDES permit limits, EPA must ensure that permitted
discharges will not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards, including designated water uses.

For use in permit applications, discharge monitoring reports, and state 
certification and to ensure compliance with effluent limitations, standards of 
performance, and pretreatment standards, EPA has promulgated regulations 
providing nationally-approved testing procedures at 40 CFR part 136. Test 
procedures have previously been approved for 262 different parameters. Those 
procedures apply to the analysis of inorganic (metal, non-metal, mineral) and 
organic chemical, radiological, bacteriological, nutrient, demand, residue, and physical parameters. 
Additionally, some particular industries may discharge pollutants for which test procedures have not been proposed
and approved under 40 CFR part 136. Under 40 CFR part 122.41 permit writers may impose monitoring requirements and
establish test methods for pollutants for which no approved part 136 method exists. 40 CFR 122.41(j) (4). EPA may also
approve additional test procedures when establishing industry-wide technology-based effluent limitations guidelines
and standards as described at 40 CFR 401.13. 
The procedures for approval of alternate test procedures (ATPs) are 
described at 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5. Under these procedures the Administrator 
may approve alternate test procedures for nationwide use which are developed and proposed by any person. 40 CFR 136.4
(a). Dischargers seeking to use such 
alternate test procedures on a limited basis (eg. for their own discharge) must apply to the State or Regional EPA permitting
office in which the discharge occurs under &sect;136.4 (d). As specified below, today's proposed rule would approve
an optional nationwide alternate procedure for determination of chlorinated pesticides and PCBs in wastewater
test samples. 


III. The Disk Extraction Test Procedure 


The 3 M Corporation, in accordance with the regulations published at 40 CFR 136.5, applied for nationwide approval
of their ``Organochlorine 
Pesticides and PCBs in Wastewater Using Empore

TM

 Disk'' . 3M subsequently 
presented data to meet the method comparability criteria set forth in the EPA 
``Protocol for Approval of Alternate Test Procedures for Inorganic and Organic 
Analytes in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Monitoring'', July 12, 1993.

Extraction and concentration are preparation steps that are required prior 
to the determination of many organic analytes that are found in wastewater. The disk extraction procedure is proposed
as an alternate to the presently approved liquid-liquid extraction procedure.



A. Scope of the Procedure



Method 3M 0222 is designed as an alternate test procedure for currently approved EPA Method 608. The Empore

TM

 disk is used in place of liquid-liquid extraction. This method is proposed as an alternate procedure for the determination
of nineteen organochlorine pesticides and seven PCBs listed below:

</TABLE>


The parameters listed in the table can be determined by this method. EPA Method 608 is a gas chromatographic (GC) method
applicable to the analysis of municipal and industrial discharges as provided under 40 CFR 136.1 for determination
of the compounds listed. When the method is used to analyze unfamiliar samples for any or all of the compounds listed,
compound identifications should be supported by at least one additional qualitative technique. The method describes
analytical conditions for a second gas chromatographic column that can be used to confirm measurements made with
the primary column.



B. Summary of the Methods



A measured volume of sample, approximately 1&hyph;L, is extracted using a 90 mm Empore

TM

 disk. The disk is eluted with acetone followed by methylene chloride. The eluant is dried by pouring through anhydrous
sodium sulfate and exchanged to hexane during concentration to a volume of 10-mL or less. The eluant is separated by
gas chromatography and the analytes are then measured with an electron capture detector.
The method provides a Florisil column cleanup procedure and an elemental sulfur removal procedure using activated
copper powder to aid in the elimination of interferences that may be encountered.


C. Technical Justification for Proposed Procedure


The recommendation for approval of these procedures is based on the data packages submitted by the applicant, 3M Corporation.
EPA is approving the method based on the method description in EPA's Environmental Monitoring Management Council
format, comparative analyses using the proposed and approved procedures, and EPA's technical and statistical reviews
of each data package.

3M Corporation provided test data using both the proposed procedure and the appropriate approved procedure to extract
pesticides and PCBs from 10 wastewaters. The results from the proposed alternate method were compared to the approved
EPA Method by EPA statisticians and chemists, who conducted detailed reviews of the data. The recovery and precision
of the submitted data for both the approved and proposed methods were also compared to the recovery and precision acceptance
criteria derived for EPA Method 608 from Performance Evaluation Studies WP 18 and 23.

The Agency has judged the currently approved Method 608 method to be acceptable in their evaluation of the proposed
procedure. EPA's Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio (EMSL-Cincinnati) thoroughly
reviewed and evaluated the supporting data submitted by the 3M Corporation. The reviews indicated that the analyses
afforded comparable recovery and precision in the recommended concentration ranges for the listed organochlorine
pesticides and PCBs. EPA is proposing approval of the Empore

TM

 disk procedure and is seeking public comment on the suitability of this procedure as an alternate procedure for use
in the determination of the parameters listed. The administrative record is on file at EMSL-Cincinnati, 26 W. Martin
Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio 45268. The record is available for public inspection. Description of the proposed
procedure is also available from 3M Corporation, 3M Center Building 220&hyph;9E&hyph;10, St. Paul, MN 55144&hyph;1000.

Based on EMSL-Cincinnati's review, and pursuant to 40 CFR 136.5, EPA proposes to approve the 3M Corporation's ``Organochlorine
Pesticides and PCBs in Wastewater Using Empore

TM

 Disk'' method as an acceptable alternative procedure for nationwide use. Specifically, the method exhibits sufficient
precision and recovery to establish (1) its acceptability under Part 136 and (2) its comparability to the approved
procedure for analysis of the stated organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. As an approved alternate test procedure,
this procedure is acceptable for use by any person required to test for these parameters using Method 608.

Public comment is requested concerning the suitability of this method for the determination of the specified analytes
in wastewater.



IV. Regulatory Requirements


A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, requires a regulatory
impact analysis. EPA has determined that this regulation is not major as it will not result in an effect on the economy
of $100 million or more, a significant increase in cost or prices, or any of the effects described in the Executive Order.
This proposed rule would simply specify an alternate analytical procedure which may be used by laboratories in measuring
concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs using EPA Method 608 and, therefore, would have no adverse
economic impacts. This action was submitted to OMB for review under the Executive Order.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



This amendment is consistent with the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 602 et seq.) because
it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The procedure included in
this proposed rule would give all laboratories the flexibility to use this alternate procedure or not to use it.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule contains no requests for information activities and, therefore, no information collection request (ICR)
was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act,
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

7Each analyst must make an initial, one-time demonstration of their ability to generate acceptable precision and
accuracy with Methods 601&hyph;603, 624, 625, 1624, and 1625 (See appendix A of the part 136) in accordance with procedures
each in section 8.2 of each of these Methods. Additionally, each laboratory, on and on-going bases must spike and analyze
10% (5% for Methods 624 and 625 and 100% for Methods 1624 and 1625) of all samples to monitor and evaluate laboratory
data quality in accordance with sections 8.3 and 8.4 of these Methods. When the recovery of any parameter falls outside
the warning limits, the analytical results for that parameter in the unspiked sample are suspect and cannot be reported
to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
