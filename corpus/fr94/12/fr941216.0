Student Educational Employment Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising its regulations and consolidating existing Federal student
employment programs into a new Student Educational Employment Program, a streamlined, flexible program that provides
students with exposure to public service and enhances their educational experience, provides financial assistance
to students to encourage and support their educational goals, encourages partnerships between Federal agencies
and educational institutions in developing effective school to work programs, and assists agencies to attract and
recruit well educated graduates into their workforce.


The Student Educational Employment Program will replace complex regulatory guidance and 13 different appointing
authorities with two appointing authorities and two simple, flexible programs. This reduction in the number of appointing
authorities and the simplifying of program requirements is in full accord with the National Performance Review.








DATES:

 

Effective date

: December 16, 1994.




Compliance date: 

For all new appointments, compliance date is December 16, 1994. All students on any of the appointments being canceled
by this regulation, must be converted to the new, appropriate appointment by February 14, 1995.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 13, 1994 (59 FR 24966), OPM published proposed regulations to consolidate the existing student employment
programs into one streamlined program, entitled the Student Educational Employment Program. The two components
of the Student Educational Employment Program recognize two distinct needs of students: a need for flexible, temporary
employment to enable them to earn a salary while continuing their studies (Student Temporary Employment Program)
and a need for career related employment which enriches students' academic experience and offers them valuable work
experience in their career field. (Student Career Experience Program). This new program would replace the following:



&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(p), graduate students in scientific, professional or analytical positions;
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(q), students in scientific, professional and technical positions,
GS&hyph;9 and below;
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(v), temporary summer aid;
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(w), stay-in-school program;
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(y), summer employment;
&bull;Schedule A authority &sect;213.3102(jj), legal intern positions;
&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202 (a) through (c), (e) and (g), cooperative education program;
&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(d), Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program; and 

&bull;Schedule B authority &sect;213.3202(f), Federal Junior Fellowship Program.


Two new Schedule B appointing authorities were proposed which would replace all of the above listed appointing authorities.
In addition to publication in the Federal Register, the proposed regulations were also mailed to all Federal agencies,
constituency groups involved in student employment, and colleges that requested them. The proposed changes were
also announced at the Federal Cooperative Education Conference and made available to all subscribers to OPM's Electronic
Bulletin Board, Mainstreet.




OPM received written comments from 10 executive level Federal agencies, and 11 independent agencies. We also received
comments from two constituency groups, six colleges and one anonymous letter. A discussion of the comments follows:



Title of Program and Use of Term ``Work Study'' 



The proposed regulations referred to the career related component of the program as the ``work study'' component.
Commenters reminded OPM that an existing and well established financial aid program already exists under that name
and that using ``work study'' in this context would create confusion. OPM agrees and the term ``work study'' will not
be used. In the final regulations we use the term ``Student Career Experience Program' in lieu of ``work study.''



Change in Definition of Student


</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-0-00003 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Commenters liked the new definition of ``student'' meaning an individual enrolled or accepted for enrollment as
a degree (or certificate, diploma etc.) seeking student taking at least a half-time academic course load. However,
several commenters wanted a better definition of ``half-time.'' In the final regulations we will indicate that the
definition of half-time must meet the academic institutions definition of ``half-time.''



Conversion From Temporary Component to Career Related Component



Commenters liked the flexibility offered by being able to convert a student from the temporary component to the career
experience component. However, if a student in the temporary component is working in a position related to their academic
and career goals, and is converted to the ``career experience'' component, the commenters wanted the work experience
to be credited towards the 640 hours of work experience required for non-competitive conversion to a career conditional
appointment. In the final regulations, we will allow for that.



Flexibility of Schedules



Several commenters asked if the ban on new student employment appointments during the summer months would continue.
Under the new program agencies may appoint students at any time during the year and a student's work schedule may be
full time or part time, as long as the student's work schedule does not interfere with his or her academic studies.



5 Month Break in Service Limitation



In the proposed regulations we stated ``An individual is still deemed to be a student if there are no breaks in course
work of more than 5 months .&blank;.&blank;.'' We received many comments indicating that there may be many instances
where a student is legitimately away from school and not taking courses for a period longer than 5 months. Work assignments
with agencies may keep a student away from classes for a greater period of time than 5 months. Illness, family or financial
problems may also preclude a student from enrollment for a period of time. However, the needs of the agency must also
be taken into consideration. Therefore, the final regulations will indicate that the intent of the program is that
a student be either attending classes or working at the agency or both during the course of the program. However, agencies
may use their own discretion in allowing a ``break in program.'' A ``break in program'' is defined as a period of time
when a program participant is neither attending classes or working at the agency.



640 Hour Minimum Work Hours Requirement



Comments regarding this new minimum requirement were varied. Some thought the number of hours was too low, some thought
it was too rigid, and some thought it should be varied depending on the academic program. However, for the sake of uniformity,
OPM wishes to establish that a Minimum amount of career related work experience be performed in order for a student
to be eligible for non-competitive conversion to a career conditional appointment. The minimum standard will be
640 hours, which can be negotiated upwards by the agency, student and academic institution as necessary and appropriate.



Documentation of Financial Need



OPM proposed giving agencies the flexibility of using financial need as an optional requirement. Commenters fell
on both sides of this issue. Some liked the idea that ``financial need'' would be an optional criteria. Other commenters
felt that allowing financial need to be an ``optional'' requirement would create inequity and chaos. In reality,
however, the poverty guidelines established by HHS and which have been used as a basis for financial need under the
former Stay-in-School and Federal Junior Fellowship Program were so unrealistically low as to be meaningless in
most instances. In fact, in most instances agencies already utilized Category 5 of the Economic Guidelines. Category
5 allowed agencies to make their own decisions regarding the financial need of the applicant and to use a variety of
factors to document this decision. Several commenters said that at least one of the student employment programs (FJFP)
was extremely underutilized due to the unrealistically low income criteria. There is no requirement in Executive
Order 12015 or in any other statute that mandates the use of financial need as a requirement for student employment.
However, agencies wishing to emphasize these opportunities to low income students may do so. Outreach and recruitment
efforts may be strategically targeted to reach and inform financially needy students.



Deletion of Term Co-operative Education (Co-op)



Comments from the co-op community indicated a concern that the new student employment regulations would no longer
use the term ``co-operative education.'' Although the term is no longer used, the model for the Student Career Experience
Program is based on the very successful model for co-op. OPM believes that retaining the ``old'' name might have precluded
or at least slowed the process of enabling and encouraging agencies to take advantage of the new flexibilities of the
Student Career Experience Program. It is expected that ongoing partnerships between the co-op community, on campus
co-operative education offices and Federal agencies will continue. OPM will continue to advise and encourage Federal
agency student employment coordinators to continue these partnerships.

(3) Student participants in the Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program under the provision of Public Law
93&hyph;842 are eligible for appointments under the student career experience program, Schedule B, 213.3202(b).

(b) Requirements for Both Components of the Student Educational Employment Program

: 

(1) 

Definition of student

: The definition of student is an individual who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a degree (diploma, certificate,
etc.) seeking student and is taking at least a half-time academic/vocational/ or technical course load in an accredited
high school, technical or vocational school, 2 year or 4 year college or university, graduate or professional school.
The definition of 

half-time

 is the definition provided by the school in which the student is enrolled. An individual who needs to complete less
than the equivalent of half an academic/vocational or technical courseload in the class enrollment period immediately
prior to graduating is still considered a student for purposes of this program.

(2) 

Schedules

: Both components of the Student Educational Employment Program are year-round programs and appointments may be
made at any time during the year, including summer. Students may work full-time or part-time schedules. There are
no limitations on the number of hours a student can work per week, but the student's work schedule should not interfere
with the student's academic schedule.

(3) 

Breaks in program

: It is expected that students accepted into the Student Educational Employment Program will at all times either be
working at the agency, enrolled in classes or both. However, agencies may use their discretion in either approving
or denying a 

break in program

. A 

break in program

 is defined as a period of time when a program participant is neither attending classes nor working at the agency. The
best interests of the student and the agency must be balanced in making these decisions.

(4) 

Employment of minors

: Participation in this program must be in conformance with Federal, State, or local laws and standards governing
the employment of minors.

(5) 

Citizenship requirements

: Agencies may appoint non-citizens to the Student Temporary Employment Program or to the Student Career Experience
Program provided that:

(i) The student is lawfully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident or otherwise authorized to be employed;

(ii) The agency is authorized to pay aliens under the annual appropriations act ban and any agency specific enabling
and appropriation statutes.

(iii) All students in the Student Career Experience Program must be U.S. citizens at the time they are non competitively
converted to a career conditional appointment.

(6) 

Employment of relatives

: In accordance with 5 CFR part 310, a student may work in the same agency with a relative when there is no direct reporting
relationship and the relative is not in a position to influence or control the student's appointment, employment,
promotion or advancement within the agency.

(7) 

Financial need

: There is no requirement for students to meet any specific economic/income criteria to be eligible for either component
of the Student Educational Employment Program. However, agencies have the option to establish and use financial
need as a criteria to select students for either or both components of the Program, if they wish. OPM will no longer develop
or distribute annual economic guidelines for use in determining financial need. An agency wishing to continue use
of the Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines may call the Department of Health and Human Services,
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation on (202) 690&hyph;6141.

(8) 

Training expenses

: Agencies may use their training authority in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 41 and 5 CFR part 410 to pay all or part of the students
training expenses.

(9) 

Student volunteers

: Student volunteers are covered by title 5, CFR, part 308, Volunteer Service, and may not be treated as employees under
this section.

(c) 

Student Temporary Employment Program

: 

(1) The Student Temporary Employment Program provides maximum flexibility to both the student and the agency.

(2) Students are appointed in the excepted service under Schedule B 213.3202(a). This is the appointment authority
regardless of the academic program being pursued.

(3) Students are appointed to a position not to exceed 1 year. Appointments under this authority may be extended in
1-year increments as long as the individual meets the definition of a student. Agencies may establish minimum academic
requirements and on the job performance requirements for continuation in the program. Students under this appointment
authority are excepted from the limitations under 5 CFR 213.104.

(4) The nature of the duties does not have to be related to the student's academic/career goals.

(5) Students are not eligible for non-competitive conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment under
this authority.

(6) There is no mandatory requirement for students to document financial need in order to be eligible for this program.
Agencies may set their own criteria if they wish.

(7) 

Classification

: Classification of students appointed under this program is based on the occupational series for which they are hired.
Grade level is to be set according to the criteria in the appropriate GS or WG classification standard.

(8) 

Qualifications

: Students under the Student Temporary Employment Program may be evaluated either by agency developed standards
or by the OPM qualification requirements for the position to which appointed. Students are eligible for promotions.
Promotions should be documented as a conversion to another excepted appointment, citing the same authority as was
used for the original appointment and maintaining the original NTE date.

(9) 

Benefits

: Students under this program:

(i) Are eligible for annual and sick leave.

(ii) Are generally ineligible for retirement coverage. Refer to 5 CFR 831.201 and 842.105.

ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Learjet Model 24, 25, 31, 35, 36, and 55 series airplanes, and Learjet 
Model 28 and 29 airplanes. This action requires a revision to the Limitations Section of 
the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight above an altitude of 
41,000 feet. This action also provides optional terminating action for that AFM revision. 
This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a safety valve in the pressurization 
system on a Learjet Model 31A airplane and reports of cracks found in the poppets of 
certain outflow/safety valves due to an improper molding process. The actions specified 
in this AD are intended to prevent such cracking and subsequent failure of the valves, 
which could result in rapid decompression of the airplane.




</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective January 3, 1995.



The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of January 3, 1995.

Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 14, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Recently, the FAA received a report of failure 
of a safety valve in the pressurization system on a Learjet Model 31A airplane. Failure of 
the valve resulted in depressurization of the cabin. Investigation revealed that the poppets 
of certain outflow/safety valves were cracked. These discrepant valves, including the 
safety valve installed on the incident airplane, had been manufactured since January 1, 
1989. Certain valves manufactured since that date have been found to be susceptible to 
cracking due to an improper molding process. Cracking in the poppets of the 
outflow/safety valves in the pressurization system can result in an open valve with an 
effective flow area of 4.4 square inches; additionally, the valve may close and remain 
closed. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the 
airplane. 




The FAA has reviewed and approved Allied Signal Aerospace Alert Service 
Bulletins 130406&hyph;21&hyph;A4011, Revision 2, dated September 28, 1994, and 
102850&hyph;21&hyph;A4021, Revision 2, dated October 6, 1994. These alert service bulletins 
describe procedures for replacement of certain outflow/safety valves in the pressurization 
system with serviceable valves. Further, the alert service bulletins recommend that the 
maximum altitude for operation of airplanes that may be equipped with these 
outflow/safety valves be limited to 41,000 feet as an interim measure until the affected 
valves are replaced.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of 
the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight above an altitude of 
41,000 feet. This AD also provides for replacement of certain outflow/safety valves in 
the pressurization system as optional terminating action for the AFM revision. 

This is considered to be interim action. The FAA is considering further 
rulemaking action to supersede this AD to require replacement of certain outflow/safety 
valves within 18 months. However, the proposed compliance time for the replacement is 
sufficiently long so that notice and time for public comment would not be impracticable. 

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it 
is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, 
and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received 
on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be 
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the 
commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of 
the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the 
rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
94&hyph;NM&hyph;210&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined 
further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. 
A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided 
under the caption

Administration of Engineering and Design Related Services Contracts; Private Sector Involvement Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the current regulation on the administration of engineering and design services contracts
in order to establish a private sector involvement program, in accordance with section 1060 of the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240). The objective of the private sector involvement
program is to encourage State highway agencies (SHA's), when using Federal-aid highway funds under the grant-in-aid
process, to increase their use of contracts with private sector consulting firms for engineering and design-related
services when it would be cost-effective to do so. Upon appropriation of funds to be allocated and solicitation of
applications, each SHA may submit a request for funding under the new private sector involvement program together
with required documentation, as specified in this final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the FHWA requested comments on its proposal to add
a new subpart, subpart B, to 23 CFR part 172, Administration of Engineering and Design Related Services Contracts,
on November 12, 1992 (57 FR 53631). Subpart B describes the procedures and criteria that the FHWA would use to evaluate
applications from States for the purposes of selecting States to receive funds under the private sector involvement
program. 



Part 172 describes the acceptable procurement methods contracting agencies are permitted to use when acquiring
engineering and design services using Federal-aid highway funds. Subpart A retains the existing procurement methods
with a technical correction and an addition to the Definition section. Subpart B has been added to establish the private
sector involvement program and the procedures to be used to implement the provisions of section 1060 of the ISTEA.


Section 1060 authorizes $5 million per year for this program to fund engineering and design services contracts for
program management, construction management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, design engineering,
surveying, mapping, or architectural related services as described in 23 U.S.C. 112(b). The authorized funds are
to be appropriated for this program through fiscal year 1997. Funds for the program were not appropriated by the Congress
for fiscal years 1992 through 1995. Funds appropriated are to remain available for use until expended. The FHWA will
allocate these funds annually, after the funds are appropriated, to at least three States which the FHWA determines
have implemented the most effective programs for increasing the percentage of funds they have expended for contracting
with private sector consulting firms for engineering and design services to carry out Federal-aid highway projects.
These private consulting firms include small business firms and small business firms owned and controlled by socially
and economically disadvantaged individuals as defined in 49 CFR part 23. 

The program established in subpart B of part 172 sets forth the procedures and criteria used in soliciting applications
from States and in evaluating the States' engineering and design programs for purposes of allocating funds under
the private sector involvement program. 

Funds received by a State under this program shall be used only for awarding contracts for engineering and design services
in accordance with the provisions of subpart A of 23 CFR part 172 and on projects and activities for which Federal-aid
highway funds may be obligated under title 23, United States Code. 

These amendments will implement the new private sector involvement program while retaining all the needed requirements
of 23 U.S.C. 112(b). This rule describes the various steps the FHWA will use to evaluate, select, and annually allocate
funds to not less than three SHA's under the private sector involvement program. 



General Comments 



The FHWA received comments from fifteen State highway agencies, six professional organizations, and seven private
sector firms. General comments were provided by five State highway agencies, six professional organizations, and
seven private sector firms in support of the private sector involvement program as proposed in the NPRM. 

The five State highway agencies supported the additional funds to be provided under the program. Each indicated that
the additional $5 million per fiscal year to be allocated to at least three States would be an incentive for a State to
consider applying for an allocation. Also, these States noted that contracting for engineering and design services
was in transition and use of consultants was expanding to handle workload peaks. 

Five of the SHA's, three professional organizations, and four private sector firms offered comments and suggestions
regarding the consideration of cost effectiveness in contracting for engineering and design services and in the
selection of States to receive allocations under the private sector involvement program. One State asked that cost
effectiveness be defined, two other States asked for an indication of the meaning of cost effectiveness, and two other
States suggested that the cost effectiveness of States' use of private sector firms be considered in selecting States
to receive allocations under the program. Other commenters offered observations, opinions, and information generally
supporting the use of private sector firms for engineering and design services as productive and effective means
to provide service. 

Numerous factors are considered in a State's decision to use consultants for engineering and design services and
all relate to cost effectiveness considerations. Factors such as quality of work, timeliness, nature of engineering
services needed, complexity of the undertaking, available expertise and resources, and current and long term program
requirements are all relative cost considerations which may apply in deciding whether States choose to contract
for engineering and design services with private sector firms. Use of these factors in decisionmaking varies from
State to State. The intent of Congress in authorizing the program was to encourage the use of consultants when the SHA's
find it to be cost effective. The Congress did not intend that the FHWA specifically apply cost-effectiveness as a
criterion in selecting SHA's to receive an allocation of funds under the private sector program. Therefore, the FHWA
has not included cost-effectiveness as a criterion in considering applications and will leave the determination
of cost-effectiveness of using consultants in a particular State to the SHA.

Section-by-Section Analysis 



Section 172.3&blank;Definitions 



This section amends the definition of engineering and design services to reflect the wording used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A)
and adds a definition of private sector engineering and design firms. 

One professional organization requested that the definition of engineering and design services be modified to cite
the statutory definition of ``architectural and engineering services'' in 40 U.S.C. 541, as amended. Two State highway
agencies requested that the definition specifically include ``environmental studies'' and ``construction engineering.''
These requests were not adopted in the final regulation as the modifications were not considered warranted or necessary.
The FHWA has retained the revised definition of engineering and design services as proposed in the NPRM; this definition
includes the contracted services as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(A), and environmental studies and construction
engineering would be permitted under this definition. The definition is intentionally broad and is not intended
to list every specific assignment for which States may choose to contract with private sector firms for engineering
and design services. 

A technical correction is made to the definition to replace the word ``and'' with the word ``or'' before the phrase
``architectural related services'' so that the definition reads the same as 
23 U.S.C 112(b)(2)(A). 



Section 172.21&blank;Purpose and Applicability 



This section defines the purpose and applicability of subpart B, which implements the private sector involvement
program and is applicable to all States using Federal-aid highway funds. 
One professional organization suggested that this section be expanded to include a policy statement consistent
with the policy in OMB Circular A&hyph;76 and Section 306 of the Federal-aid Highway Act of 1958 (Pub. L 85&hyph;381,
72 Stat. 89) to require States to utilize the private sector for services such as surveying and photogrammetric mapping
services, whenever practicable. The proposed change is not necessary and FHWA did not include the suggested policy
statement because the intent of the private sector program is to encourage States to use private sector firms for engineering
and design services which by definition include mapping and surveying services. 

In a second comment, relating to paragraph (b) of &sect;172.21, the same professional organization suggested revising
the applicability of the rule to include ``all engineering and design services contracts financed with Federal-aid
highway funds or other non-Federal resources.'' We agree. For purposes of soliciting applicants and selecting States
to receive allocations, the rule described in &sect;172.23 allows applicants to supplement the information on the
extent consultant services have been used on Federal-aid highway projects with the same information on non-federally
funded consultant contracted services on projects ultimately to be built with Federal-aid highway funds. Section
172.23 is retained as shown in the proposed rule since the mandate of the program in the legislation is to encourage
contracting with private firms ``in carrying out Federal-aid highway projects.'' 



Section 172.23 Evaluation and Selection 



This section outlines the procedures and criteria that would be used in the evaluation of State engineering and design
programs for the purpose of allocating funds under the new private sector involvement program. 

Comments on the procedures and criteria to be used in the annual evaluation and selection of not less than three States
to receive allocations under the private sector involvement program were received from five State highway agencies,
two professional organizations, and seven private sector firms. One professional organization referenced a study
in the ``Professional Services Management Journal'' which indicates that the ``percent of engineering contracted
out'' was the only variable that correlated with the effectiveness of a State's program of using consultants. Three
States suggested that improvements resulting from new, ambitious, non-traditional, and innovative practices
which increased the use of consultant programs should be given weight in the selection process. Two States suggested
that the size of a State's highway program should be considered in the evaluation of applications. Another State suggested
that a State's past commitments to increasing the use of consultants should be considered. Most States supported
the inclusion of State and local agency funding information to give a full picture of the use of consultants in all States.
One professional organization suggested that several evaluation factors, such as quality, cost effectiveness,
liability, and consultant selection process, be considered rather than the percentage of work contracted out to
consultants. 

We have concluded that the intent of the program is to encourage the use of private sector firms. The FHWA recognizes
that most States have not established a specific formal program to encourage the use of consultants, but may nevertheless
have been effective in obtaining increased use of private sector firms. Recognizing the different decisionmaking
processes used by SHA's, the evaluation process adopted for the private sector program will use as its primary basis
of measurement, in determining which States have the most effective program for increasing the percentage of funds
expended for contracting with private firms, the results of a comparison of all States' programs for the preceding
year and the year-to-year results of each State's program for the preceding five years. The evaluation will focus
on results rather than an evaluation of individual programs or processes. A State process or program that encourages
the use of private sector firms would be consistent with the intent of this program; however, the FHWA is not in a position
to objectively evaluate and compare different State approaches. Instead, the FHWA agrees with the suggestion that
the evaluation process be confined to verifiable measures consistent with the intent of the program. The procedures
will primarily consider the relative size of the State's highway program and the extent to which the State has contracted
for private sector services in the preceding year and in the preceding five years, but will also consider any information
which describes State efforts to encourage the use of private sector firms.

Section 172.25 Funding 


This section provides that the funds received by a State may only be used for awarding contracts for engineering and
design services to carry out projects and activities eligible for Federal-aid funding and the Federal share shall
be the same as the Federal-aid share applicable to the type of work or project being developed or the system on which
the project is located. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


The FHWA has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866
or a significant regulation under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. This
regulation implements section 1060 of the ISTEA which expressly requires the FHWA to issue regulations to carry out
the private sector involvement program. The program enables State highway agencies to apply for Federal-aid highway
funds which may only be used to contract for engineering and design services with the private sector. When funds are
appropriated, the $5 million authorized for the program will be made available to at least three States. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 
601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. This rule sets forth the criteria
under which the FHWA would select three or more States to receive grants for engineering and design services. States,
however, are not included within the definition of ``small entity'' set forth in 5 U.S.C. 601(6). Therefore, the FHWA
hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a separate federalism assessment. 


Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) 


Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations
implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities
apply to this program. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 
44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The FHWA has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

) and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment. 


Regulation Identification Number 


A regulation identification number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.

 Any individual or private firm (including small business concerns and small businesses owned and controlled by socially
and economically disadvantaged individuals as defined in 49 CFR part 23) contracting with a State to provide engineering
and design services. 



* * * * *


3. Part 172 is amended by designating &sect;&sect;172.1 through 172.15 as Subpart A_Procurement Procedures. 


Subpart B_[Added] 


4. Part 172 is amended by adding subpart B to read as follows: 



Subpart B_Private Sector Involvement Program 


Sec. 


172.21&blank;Purpose and applicability. 
172.23&blank;Evaluation and selection. 
172.25&blank;Funding. 


&sect;172.21&blank;Purpose and applicability. 


(a) The purpose of this subpart is to implement a program to encourage States to contract for engineering and design
services with the private sector whenever such contracts would be cost effective. 
(b) This subpart applies to all engineering and design services 
contracts financed with Federal-aid highway funds. 


&sect;172.23

Evaluation and selection. 


(a) When funds are appropriated for this program, the FHWA will invite States to submit applications to participate
in the program. The FHWA will use the applications to make the program allocations under the program. 
(b) The FHWA will make a comparison of the applicants based on the amount of Federal-aid highway funds each State has
expended on contracts for engineering and design services. In assessing the amount of funds a State spent in procuring
engineering and design services, the FHWA will also consider the amounts expended by States on 100 percent State-funded
engineering and design services contracts involving projects to be constructed with Federal-aid highway funds
to the extent the State provides such information with its application. 
(c) The FHWA will select not less than three States each fiscal year to receive funds under this program. 
(1) Selection of the States to receive funding under this program will be made by determining which States were the
most effective in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the
year preceding the fiscal year in which funds are to be allocated. In the selection process, the FHWA will evaluate
each State's program of contracting for engineering and design services. The evaluation will primarily consider
such information as the amount and percentage of Federal-aid highway funds and State funds expended on engineering
and design services contracts, the number of contracts awarded for such services, the relative size of the State's
Federal-aid highway program and the increases in use of private sector firms during the preceding year and the preceding

five years. 
(2) Upon the FHWA's request for applications, each State interested in being considered should submit its application
through its appropriate FHWA Division Office. The application may be in letter form and should include current information
on the extent of the State's use of consultants for engineering and design on Federal-aid highway projects. In addition,
the State may provide data on the amount of 100 percent State-funded engineering and design services contracts involving
projects to be built with Federal-aid highway funds and any other information demonstrating the State's effectiveness
in increasing the percentage of funds expended on engineering and design services contracts in the past five years.



&sect;172.25

Funding. 


(a) Funds received by a State under this program may only be used for awarding engineering and design services contracts
with the private sector. These contracts shall carry out services and activities eligible for Federal-aid funding
under title 23, United States Code. 
(b) The Federal share of any project obligated with funds allocated under this program shall be the same as the Federal
share applicable to the type of work or project being developed or the system on which the project is located. Funds
allocated under this program shall remain available until expended. 
(c) Funds will be allocated to the States each fiscal year from 1995 through 1997 to the extent funds are appropriated.

Technical amendments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is transferring its management of the day-to-day operations of the lessee
training program (LTP) from MMS Headquarters to its regional offices. Therefore, MMS is amending its regulations
on oil and gas and sulphur operations in the Outer Continental Shelf to reflect that change. Management of the LTP in
the regional offices will improve customer service by placing MMS employees involved with approving the schools'
and organizations' training programs and implementation plans and conducting onsite evaluations and audits in
close proximity to the schools.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The MMS is responsible for operations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). An important factor in ensuring that OCS
oil and gas operations are carried out in a manner which emphasizes the safety of operations and minimizes the risk
of environmental damage is the lessees' employment of highly qualified and trained personnel to perform such operations.
To ensure that key operating personnel of lessees and contractors are properly trained in well-control and production
safety systems, MMS has developed and implemented training regulations since the late 1970's. Initially, training
was required for key personnel in drilling well-control and production safety devices. In the late 1980's, MMS proposed
new training for well-completion, well-workover, and well-servicing operations and revised regulations for drilling
and production safety systems. These training regulations_30 CFR 250.210, 30 CFR 250.211, 30 CFR 250.212, 30 CFR
250.213, 30 CFR 250.214, and 30 CFR 250.215_Subpart O_Training, became fully effective on February 25, 1993.





Since the late seventies, MMS Headquarters personnel have been responsible for the day-to-day operation of the training
program, including the review of training programs and implementation plans, and conducting of onsite evaluations
and audits. Beginning with the effective date of these technical amendments, MMS regional offices will manage these
day-to-day operations of the LTP. Headquarters will remain responsible for program oversight and coordination.

Decentralization of the LTP to the regional offices is being performed to decrease the project management costs associated
with implementing this program and to provide MMS's customers with more timely service.

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Temporary special local regulations are being adopted for those portions of the International America's Cup Class
(IACC) Citizen Cup Defender Selection Series and the Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Selection Series that are being
conducted in the waters of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to San Diego Bay and Mission Bay on the following dates: January
12, 1995 through January 22, 1995; January 29, 1995 through February 11, 1995; February 14, 1995 through February
27, 1995; and March 2, 1995 through March 12, 1995, inclusive. These regulations are necessary to provide for the safety
of life, property, and navigation on the navigable waters of the United States during the scheduled events.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

These regulations become effective at 10 a.m. PST on January 12, 1995 and terminate at 7 p.m. PST on March 12, 1995 unless
canceled earlier by the District Commander. Comments must be received by January 11, 1995.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Comments may be mailed to Lieutenant Cam Lewis, USCG America's Cup Patrol, Naval Training Center, Building 302, San
Diego, California 92133&hyph;5000, Attn: CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;009 or may be delivered to the same address between
8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays.




The Eleventh Coast Guard District Commander maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments will become
part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at the Eleventh Coast Guard District Office, Operations
Division, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, Suite 6200, Long Beach, California 90822&hyph;5399.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and it is being
made effective in less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would
be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant
vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication
more than 30 days prior to the start of the event.




Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless
desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable. Accordingly, persons wishing to comment may
do so by submitting written comments to the office listed under 

ADDRESSES 

in this preamble. Those providing comments should identify the docket number (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;009) for the
regulation and also include their name, address and reason(s) for each comment presented. Persons wanting acknowledgment
of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

Based upon the comments received, the scope of the regulation may be changed. 



Drafting Information 



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Cam Lewis, Project Officer for the Patrol
Commander, and Lieutenant Commander Craig Juckniess, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.




Discussion of Regulation 



The event prompting a need for these Special Local Regulations is the International America's Cup Class (IACC) Citizen
Cup Defender Selection Series and the Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Selection Series which will be conducted in the
San Diego area on several series of dates during the period January through mid-March 1995. In addition, races in the
Citizen Cup Defender Semi-Final and Final Series, the Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Semi-Final and Final Series,
and the America's Cup Match Races will be held on several series of dates during the period mid-March through May 1995.
Special Local Regulations establishing measures promoting the safety of these races are the subject of separate
rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;010); as these regulations contain different vessel operating restrictions,
publishing a separate set of regulations for the latter period will help reduce confusion to the public. 

These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race
venue during the Citizen Cup and Louis Vuitton Cup by controlling the traffic entering, exiting, and traveling within
these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses
a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations. 

Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements
have been established for orderly passage to and from San Diego Bay and the race venue. 

Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. 

On each specified race date, these regulations will be in effect in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay during two periods:
between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon; and again in the afternoon for a two-hour period which will fall between 2:30
p.m. and 7 p.m. Selection of the afternoon regulatory period will depend on the time of termination of race activities
for that date. Notice of commencement and termination of the afternoon regulatory period will be made by Broadcast
Notice to Mariners; a 15-minute advance notice of commencement of the afternoon regulatory period will also be broadcast.


The nature of the winner selection process and other circumstances may dictate that races will not actually be conducted
on dates specified as race dates. In the event of cancellation or postponement of races scheduled for a particular
date, the Patrol Commander's election not to implement these regulations on that date will be announced via Broadcast
Notice to Mariners. 


The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and/or a five knot speed limit. These requirements will
be activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. In addition, sailing vessels
may be restricted to operating under auxiliary power or under tow, and motor-sailing with mainsail only. Activation
of these additional regulations will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.

Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth
traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers.
Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable
waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and
viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the
navigable waters of the United States.
All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory
periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented
in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.


Regulatory Evaluation


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.


Collection of Information


This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Office at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

.
The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES

.

ACTION:

 Direct final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approves Illinois' May 18, 1994, request to repeal the
Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone in the East
St. Louis (Metro-East) moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of three Illinois counties: Madison, Monroe
and St. Clair. Section 202 of the 1990 Clean Air Act (Act) provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate
ozone nonattainment areas if USEPA promulgates on board vapor recovery (OBVR) regulations. The USEPA promulgated
OBVR controls on April 6, 1994, which became effective on May 6, 1994. USEPA made a finding of completeness on the SIP
submittal on August 24, 1994. 


In the proposed rules section of this 

Federal Register

, USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments
are received on this action, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in response to this

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The USEPA approved the incorporation of Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the East St. Louis area (Madison,
Monroe, and St. Clair Counties) of Illinois which was designated as a moderate ozone nonattainment area pursuant
to the 1990 Act on January 12, 1993 (58 FR 3841), at 40 CFR 52.720(c)(93)(i)(B). On May 18, 1994, the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted a SIP revision request in the form of a February 17, 1994, Final Opinion and Order
of the [Illinois Pollution Control] Board in rulemaking R93&hyph;28. Rulemaking R93&hyph;28 repeals the Stage
II vapor recovery controls applicable to the East St. Louis area. 


Stage II vapor recovery systems are designed to control and capture hydrocarbon vapors during the refueling of motor
vehicles. Vehicle fuel emissions consist of gasoline vapors displaced from the vehicle tank by dispensed liquid
gasoline as the tank is filled. The Stage II system captures these vapors as they exit the fuel fillpipe, thereby preventing
escape of the vapors into the atmosphere. Vapor capture is accomplished by one of several types of devices attached
to or part of the nozzle of the fuel dispensing system. 
The Stage II regulations at issue are found at Illinois Administrative Code, Title 35: Environmental Protection,
subtitle B: Air Pollution, chapter I: Pollution Control Board, part 219: Organic Material Standards and Limitations
for the Metro-East Area, subpart Y: Gasoline Distribution; &sect;219.583 Gasoline Dispensing Facilities_Storage
Tank Filling Operations, amended at 16 Illinois Register 13883, effective August 24, 1992, and; &sect;219.586 Gasoline
Dispensing Facilities_Motor Vehicle Fueling Operations, added at 16 Illinois Register 13883, effective August
24, 1992. The USEPA approved the incorporation of these regulations into the Illinois SIP on January 12, 1993, (58
FR 3841). This approval was codified at 40 CFR 52.720(c)(93). 
Section 202 of the amended Act provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate ozone nonattainment
areas if USEPA promulgates OBVR regulations (42 U.S.C. 7521(a)(6)). The USEPA promulgated OBVR controls on April
6, 1994 (59 FR 16262), which became effective on May 6, 1994. This promulgation was ordered by the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as the result of a suit brought against USEPA by the Natural Resources
Defense Counsel and others (

NRDC 

v. 

Reilly,

 No. 921137, DC Cir. January 22, 1993). 
On October 21, 1993, IEPA petitioned the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) to repeal the Stage II vapor recovery
regulations applicable in the East St. Louis area. The IEPA based its petition on the large capital costs associated
with Stage II controls and their impact on the economically depressed East St. Louis area to satisfy a requirement
which would cease to exist once USEPA completed promulgation of OBVR regulations. 
The Illinois administrative record for this repeal estimated that 377 facilities would be subject to Stage II control
requirements in the East St. Louis area. Capital costs associated with installing these controls exceeded $8,500,000.
Further, these controls would not be required once USEPA promulgated OBVR regulations. Based on the administrative
record for its rulemaking the IPCB repealed the regulations requiring Stage II vapor recovery in the East St. Louis
area. 
Since section 202 of the amended Act provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate ozone nonattainment
areas if USEPA promulgates OBVR regulations, USEPA believes that it must allow States to repeal Stage II regulations
and revise their SIPs in moderate ozone nonattainment areas unless the State will rely on these regulations to provide
emission reductions to satisfy other requirements of the Act, such as to achieve reasonable further progress toward
attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. As part of its submittal of this repeal of the requirement
for Stage II in the East St. Louis area, IEPA provided assurances that emission reductions from Stage II had not been
relied upon in the 15 percent plan for the East St. Louis area. On November 22, 1994, Illinois submitted its final 15
percent plan for the East St. Louis Area. The State's 15 percent plan does not rely on emission reductions from Stage
II to achieve the required 15 percent emission reduction requirement. Based on the State's submittal, USEPA is approving
the repeal of the Stage II requirements for the East St. Louis area from the SIP. 
The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be
filed. This action will be effective on February 14, 1995 unless adverse or critical comments are received by January
17, 1995.

If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective February 14, 1995. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

Under section 307(b)(1)of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 14, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purpose of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains corrections to the final rules that were published on Thursday, November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59502).
These rules regulate licensing and use of radio stations that provide public mobile services, including paging and
cellular telephone services.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



The final rules that are the subject of these corrections are part of a revision of 47 CFR Part 22 in its entirety and certain
related rule sections in 47 CFR Part 1.



Need for Correction



A few of the final rules, as published, contain errors that cause the publication to be inconsistent with the current
CFR in one instance and to contradict other portions of the FCC document in the other instances. These errors have already
caused some confusion among regulatees and as a result industry organizations have requested clarification. Therefore,
this correction is necessary.



Correction of Publication



The amendatory language contained in instruction number 3 states that the phrase ``Except as specified in &sect;22.6'',
is to be removed. However, this instruction can not be carried out in reference to the current CFR, because the indicated
phrase has already been removed by a previous amendment (59 FR 30984, published June 18, 1994). Consequently &sect;1.742
will not be amended.

In &sect;22.121, paragraph (d) reads in pertinent portions ``If an authorization is voluntarily cancelled or automatically
terminated *&blank;*&blank;* on the same channel (or, in the case of a 931 MHz paging station, the same frequency range)
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' However, the FCC stated in the discussion of this rule section in Appendix A of the 

Report and Order

 that the waiting period would not apply in the case of authorizations submitted voluntarily for cancellation. Furthermore,
in the 

Report and Order,

 the FCC decided to require that applications for 931 MHz paging stations specify the channel(s) for which authorization
is desired, rather than continuing to require that such applications request authorization for channels to be selected
by the FCC staff. Because of this decision, the waiting period applies only to the specific 931 MHz channels involved,
and not to the entire 931 MHz frequency range. In &sect;22.165, the word ``in'' was inadvertently omitted. In &sect;22.901,
the language adopted reflected an earlier version of the CFR rather than the current version.

Accordingly, the publication of November 17, 1994, FR Doc. 94&hyph;27415, of final rules in CC Docket Nos. 92&hyph;115,
94&hyph;46 and 93&hyph;116 is corrected as follows:



&sect;1.742



[Corrected]



1. On page 59503, in the second column, remove amendatory instruction 3.



&sect;22.121


[Corrected]



2. On page 59514, in the third column, in &sect;22.121, the first sentence in paragraph (d) is corrected by removing
the two phrases ``voluntarily cancelled or'' and ``(or, in the case of a 931 MHz paging station, the same frequency
range)''.



&sect;22.165


[Corrected]



3. On page 59523, in the first column, in &sect;22.165, in paragraph (d)(2), the words ``set forth &sect;22.411''
are corrected to read ``set forth in &sect;22.411''.



&sect;22.901


[Corrected]



4. On page 59560, in the second column, in &sect;22.901, in the introductory text of paragraph (d), the phrase ``communication
channels in'' is corrected to read ``spectrum within''.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation to incorporate the temporary change
made by Acquisition Circular (AC&hyph;93&hyph;1) which implemented the Memorandum of Understanding between the
United States and the European Economic Community (EC) on Government Procurement and the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). The rule is essentially the same as the Circular that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69243), except for minor modifications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Public Comments



A temporary rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69243) in order to meet the January 1, 1994, effective date for implementation of NAFTA.
The temporary rule invited public comments. No public comments were received.



B. Executive Order 12866



This rule was not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget because it is not a significant rule as defined in
Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The changes do not appear to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the
meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et sequentia

 because they permit offerors to use EC and NAFTA country end products or construction materials above certain thresholds
without application of Buy American Act preference. For this reason, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.
No comments from small entities were received.



D. Paperwork Reduction Act



The provision at 552.225&hyph;75, Buy American Act Notice-Construction Materials, which is being modified by this
rule, does contain an information collection requirement. However, the revision does not affect the information
collection requirements that have previously been approved by OMB and assigned Control Number 3090&hyph;0198.

PART 525_FOREIGN ACQUISITION



2. Section 525.203 is revised to read as follows:



525.203 

Evaluation of offers.



(a) The HCA or a designee may authorize the use of a particular foreign construction material when the use of a comparable
domestic construction material would unreasonably increase the cost of the contract. The cost of a particular domestic
construction material shall be determined to be unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign
material by more than 6 percent. The cost of construction material includes all delivery costs to the construction
site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued).

(b) The evaluation process described in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:

(1) Excepted materials listed in the solicitation; or

(2) European Community (EC) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) country construction materials offered
in response to solicitations for construction contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more.

(c) Offerors proposing to use foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials
on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) are required to provide adequate information for Government
evaluation under paragraph (a) of this section. Offerors may submit alternate offers for comparable domestic construction
materials at stated prices. When foreign construction material (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials
on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) is not authorized under paragraph (a), evaluation of the
offer must be based on the stated price, if any, for comparable domestic material. If an offeror proposing to use foreign
construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value
of $6,500,000 or more) does not furnish data on the cost of comparable domestic construction material, and the use
of foreign construction material is not authorized, such offer must be rejected, unless the contracting officer
is able to obtain prices on comparable domestic material which verifies that domestic prices are unreasonable.

(d) The contracting officer shall add 6 percent to the cost of foreign construction materials (other than EC or NAFTA
country construction materials on contracts with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more) authorized for use in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to the prices offered, if applicable, for evaluation purposes only.

3. Section 525.205 is revised to read as follows:



525.205 

Solicitation provision and contract clause.



The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 552.225&hyph;75, Buy American Act Notice_Construction Materials
in solicitations for construction that include the Buy American Act_Construction Materials clause at (FAR) 48 CFR
52.225&hyph;5 and have an estimated value less than $6,500,000. Alternate I shall be used for construction contracts
with an estimated value of $6,500,000 or more that include the Buy American Act_Construction Materials Under European
Community Agreement and NAFTA clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.225&hyph;15.

4. Section 525.402 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:




525.402 

Policy.



(a) Under (FAR) 48 CFR 25.402(a), when the estimated value of all items or products (exclusive of any item or product
within any of the exceptions described in (FAR) 48 CFR 25.403) listed in the solicitation exceeds the Trade Agreements
Act threshold, contracting officers shall evaluate offers without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American
Act or the Balance of Payments Program.

PART 552_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES




5. Section 552.225&hyph;8 is revised to read as follows:



552.225&hyph;8 

Trade Agreements Act Certificate.



As prescribed in 525.407(a), insert the following provision:



TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT CERTIFICATE (DEC 1994)

(DEVIATION FAR 52.225&hyph;8)



(a) The Offeror, by signing this offer, certifies that each end product to be delivered under this contract is a U.S.
made end product, a designated country end product, a Caribbean Basin country end product, a Canadian end product
or a Mexican end product as defined in the clause entitled ``Trade Agreements Act'' at 48 CFR 552.225&hyph;9.

(b) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with subpart 25.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation except that offers
of U.S. made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin end products, Canadian end products,
or Mexican end products shall be evaluated without the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments
Program.



(End of Provision)



6. Section 552.225&hyph;9 is revised to read as follows:



552.225&hyph;9 

Trade Agreements Act.



As prescribed in 525.407(a), insert the following clause.



TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT (DEC 1994)

(DEVIATION FAR 52.225&hyph;9)



(a) This clause implements the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501&hyph;2582) by providing a preference
for U.S. made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin country end products, Canadian end
products or Mexican end products over other products.

``Caribbean Basin country end products,'' as used in this clause, means an article that: (1) is wholly the growth,

has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct
from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term includes services (except transportation
services) incidental to its supply; provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the
product itself. It does not include service contracts as such. The term excludes products that are excluded from duty
free treatment from Caribbean countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)). These
exclusions presently consist of (i) textiles and apparel articles that are subject to textile agreements; (ii) footwear,
handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel not designated as eligible articles for
the purpose of the Generalized System of Preference under title V of the Trade Act of 1974; (iii) tuna, prepared or preserved
in any manner in airtight containers, (iv) petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum; and (v) watches and watch
parts (including cases, bracelets and straps) of whatever type including, but not limited to, mechanical, quartz
digital or quartz analog, if such watches or watch parts contain any material that is the product of any country to which
the Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS) column 2 rates of duty apply.

or manufacture of the designated country (as defined in section 25.401 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)),
or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality,
has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct
from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term includes services (except transportation
services) incidental to its supply, provided that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the
product itself. It does not include service contracts as such.

``Canadian end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture
of Canada, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality,
has been substantially transformed in Canada into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character,
or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term includes services (except
transportation services) incidental to its supply; provided, that the value of those incidental services does not
exceed that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as such.

``Mexican end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture
of Mexico, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality,
has been substantially transformed in Mexico into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character,
or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term includes services (except
transportation services) incidental to its supply, provided that the value of those incidental services does not
exceed that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as such.

``End products,'' as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under this
contract for public use.

``U.S. made end product,'' as used in this clause, means an article which (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture
of the United States, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country
or instrumentality, has been substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different article of commerce
with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed.

``Nondesignated country end products,'' as used in this clause, means any end product which is not a U.S. made end product,
designated country end product, Caribbean Basin Country end product, Canadian end product or Mexican end product.

``United States,'' as used in this clause, means the United States, its possessions, Puerto Rico, and any other place
which is subject to its jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases or trust territories.

(b) The Contractor agrees to deliver under this contract only U.S. made end products, designated country end products,
Caribbean Basin country end products, Canadian end products or Mexican end products or, if a national interest waiver
is granted under section 302 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, nondesignated country end products. Only if such
waiver is granted may a nondesignated country end product be delivered under this contract(s). 

(c) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the policies and procedures of Part 25 of the FAR except that offers
of U.S. made end products, designated country end products, Caribbean Basin end products, Canadian end products
or Mexican end products shall be evaluated without the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments
Program.

7. Section 552.225&hyph;72 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(1) and (c) [the chart is
unchanged] to read as follows:



552.225&hyph;72

Eligible Products From Nondesignated Countries_Waiver.



As prescribed in 525.407(b), insert the following clause:



ELIGIBLE PRODUCTS FROM NONDESIGNATED COUNTRIES_WAIVER (DEC 1994)



(a) In accordance with the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 and 48 CFR 25.402(b), no eligible product that originates in
a nondesignated country may be purchased by a Federal agency. However, this restriction may be waived before award
when it is determined to be in the national interest. Accordingly, offers to furnish products originating in a nondesignated
country identified in paragraph (c) below, may be submitted in response to this solicitation and will be considered
for award if a waiver is obtained from the U.S. Trade Representative or a designee (19 U.S.C. 2512) on the basis that:

(1) No responsive bid or technically acceptable offer from a responsible offeror is received offering U.S. or designated
country end products Caribbean end products, Canadian or Mexican end products as defined in the clause entitled ``Trade
Agreements Act'' in this solicitation; or



* * * * *



(c) The Offeror certifies that the following product(s) is an end product other than an end product of the United States,
a designated country or a Caribbean Basin country Canadian or Mexican end products, as such end products are defined
in the clause entitled ``Trade Agreements Act'' in this solicitation:



* * * * *



8. Section 552.225&hyph;75 is revised to read as follows:



552.225&hyph;75

Buy American Act Notice_Construction Materials.



As prescribed in 525.205, insert the following provision:



BUY AMERICAN ACT NOTICE_CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (JAN 1994)



(a) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10) generally requires that only domestic construction material be used in performing
this contract (See the clause entitled ``Buy American Act_Construction Materials''). This requirement does not
apply to the excepted construction material or components listed below:



(List applicable excepted materials or indicate ``none.'')



(b) Offers based on the use of other foreign construction material may be acceptable for award if the Government determines
that_

(1) Comparable domestic construction material in sufficient and reasonably available quantities, of a satisfactory
quality, is unavailable; or 

(2) Use of comparable domestic construction material is impracticable or would unreasonably increase the cost of
this contract.

(c) Any offer based on the use of one or more other foreign construction materials shall include current data, based
on a reasonable canvass of suppliers, in the format listed in paragraph (g) below, clearly demonstrating that the
cost of each other foreign construction material, plus 6 percent, is less than the cost of each comparable domestic
construction material. The cost of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site
and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate may be issued).

(d) For evaluation purposes, the Government will add to the offer 6 percent of the cost of other foreign construction
material that qualifies for acceptance under paragraph (c) above.

(e) When offering other foreign construction material, offerors may also offer, at stated prices, any available
comparable domestic construction material to avoid the possibility that the entire offer will be rejected if the
other foreign construction material is not accepted under (c) above. If any other foreign construction material
does not qualify for acceptance under paragraph (c) above, the Government will evaluate the offer on the basis of the
stated price for comparable domestic construction material, and the Offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic
construction material at that price. If the Offeror does not state a price for a comparable domestic construction
material, and the other foreign construction material does not qualify for acceptance under paragraph (c) above,
the offer will be rejected in sealed bid procurements and may be rejected in negotiated procurements.

(f) If the foregoing procedure results in a tie between a foreign offer as evaluated and a domestic offer, award shall
be made on the domestic offer. In such case, offers proposing to use any foreign construction material will be considered
to be foreign offers. 

(g) For evaluation purposes under paragraph (c) above, the following information and any applicable supporting
data based on the canvass of suppliers shall be included in the offer for the use of one or more other foreign construction
materials:

and (f) substituted. In addition, two asterisks should be inserted after the phrase ``Foreign construction material''
each time it appears in the chart in paragraph (g) and the following explanation added at the bottom of the chart ``*&blank;*&blank;*
Do not include EC or NAFTA country construction materials.'' 

(a) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10) generally requires that only domestic construction material be used in performing
this contract. However, the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States of America and the European Community
(EC) on Government procurement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) exempt EC and NAFTA country construction
material from application of the Buy American Act. (See FAR 52.225&hyph;15 ``Construction Materials under European
Community and NAFTA Agreements''). Therefore, the Contractor shall use only domestic construction material, EC
construction materials, or NAFTA country construction materials in the performance of this contract except for
other foreign construction materials, if any, listed below. ``Other foreign construction material,'' as used in
this provision, means construction material that is not EC or NAFTA country construction material as defined in FAR
52.225&hyph;15.



(List applicable excepted materials or indicate ``none.'')



(f) If the foregoing procedure results in a tie between an offer that includes other foreign construction material
as evaluated and an offer that includes domestic, EC or NAFTA construction material, award shall be made on the offer
providing domestic, EC or NAFTA construction material.

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status for the arroyo southwestern toad (

Bufo microscaphus californicus

) pursuant to the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The arroyo toad occurs exclusively
in streams in 
southern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The 
arroyo toad has been extirpated from an estimated 75 percent of its 
former range. Threats to the survival of this species include: habitat 
degradation, predation, and small population sizes. Only 6 of the 22 
extant populations south of Ventura are known to contain more than a 
dozen adults. This rule implements the protection and recovery 
provisions provided by the Act for the arroyo southwestern toad.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The arroyo toad (

Bufo microscaphus californicus

) is a small toad in 
the family Bufonidae. This taxon was originally described as 

Bufo 
cognatus californicus

 from a specimen collected at Santa Paula, Ventura 
County (Camp 1915). Camp's specimen was later shown to differ in 
several respects from 

Bufo cognatus

 and was afforded specific status as 


Bufo californicus

 (Myers 1930). In the following two decades, this toad 
was considered a subspecies of 

Bufo compactilis

 (Linsdale 1940) and of 


B

. 

woodhousei

 (Shannon 1949). The currently accepted taxonomy of the arroyo toad as a subspecies of 

Bufo microscaphus

, the southwestern toad, is based on morphological similarities (Stebbins 1951, Price and 
Sullivan 1988). The arroyo toad (

B

. 

microscaphus californicus

) is 
geographically isolated from the Arizona toad (

B

. 

microscaphus 
microscaphus

) by the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. Work is now in 
progress to determine if the arroyo toad is genetically distinct at the 
species level (S. Sweet, Univ. of Calif., Santa Barbara, pers. comm., 
1991). 
The arroyo toad is a small (5 to 8 centimeters (cm) (2 to 3 
inches)), light greenish gray or tan toad with warty skin and dark 
spots. Its underside is buff colored and often without spots. A light- 
colored stripe crosses the head and eyelids, and a light area usually 
occurs on each sacral hump and in the middle of the back. Its movement 
consists of hopping rather than walking. Its courtship vocalization is 
a high trill, usually lasting 8 to 10 seconds. 

The arroyo toad is restricted to rivers that have shallow, gravelly 
pools adjacent to sandy terraces. Breeding occurs on large streams with 
persistent water from late March until mid-June (Sweet 1989). Eggs are 
deposited and larvae develop in shallow pools with minimal current and 
little or no emergent vegetation and with sand or pea gravel substrate 
overlain with flocculent silt. After metamorphosis (June or July), the 
juvenile toads remain on the bordering gravel bars until the pool no 
longer persists (3 to 8 weeks, depending on site and year) (Sweet 1992). 
Juveniles and adults forage for insects on sandy stream terraces that 
have nearly complete closure of cottonwoods (

Populus

 spp.), oaks 
(

Quercus

 spp.), or willows (

Salix

 spp.), and almost no grass and 
herbaceous cover at ground level. Adult toads excavate shallow burrows 
on the terraces where they shelter during the day when the surface is 
damp or during longer intervals in the dry season (Sweet 1989). 

Arroyo toads were historically found along the length of drainages 
in southern California from San Luis Obispo County to San Diego County, 
but now they survive primarily in the headwaters as small isolated 
populations (Sweet 1992, J. Stephenson, Cleveland National Forest, 

in 
litt

., 1993). Urbanization and dam construction beginning in the early 
1900's in southern California caused most of the extensive habitat 
degradation. The species was formerly distributed southward along the 
northwestern coastal region of Baja California, Mexico, to the vicinity 
of San Quintin (ca. 30.5
&cir; N Lat.). 

Most remaining populations in the United States occur on privately 
owned lands, primarily within or adjacent to the Cleveland National 
Forest. Less than 50 percent of the known extant populations of arroyo 
toad occur in areas owned or managed by the Forest Service (Los Padres, 
San Bernardino, and Cleveland National Forests) (Sweet 1992, J. 
Stephenson, 

in litt

., 1993). Due mostly to habitat destruction, only 
eight drainages remain where populations of this species may be viable 
(S. Sweet, pers. comm. 1993; J. Stephenson, 

in litt

., 1993). In 1990, 
only seven pairs of arroyo toads were known to have bred anywhere within 
the toad's range (Sweet 1992). Due to the isolation and the small 
sizes, almost all populations are at great risk of extinction.

Previous Federal Action 



The arroyo toad was first included by the Service as a category 2 
candidate species in the September 18, 1985, Notice of Review of 
Vertebrate Wildlife (50 FR 37958). Category 2 applies to taxa for which 
information now in the possession of the Service indicates that 
proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, 
but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are 
not currently available to support proposed rules. The subspecies also 
was included as a category 2 candidate in the January 6, 1989, and 
November 21, 1991, Animal Notices of Review (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, 
respectively). After publication of the most recent Notice of Review, 
the Service obtained substantial information on the biological 
vulnerability and the environmental threats to elevate this species to 
category 1. Category 1 species are those for which the Service 
possesses sufficient data to support proposals for listing. Most of the 
new information and analyses came from Dr. Samuel Sweet, University of 
California, Santa Barbara; Dr. Mark Jennings, California Academy of 
Sciences; and staff of the Los Padres National Forest. 

On December 30, 1992, (not January 12, 1993, as indicated in 
proposed rule (58 FR 41232)) the Service received a petition from Dr. 
Sweet and Dr. Mark Jennings to list the arroyo toad as endangered (Sweet 
and Jennings 1992). Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 
1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

), requires to the maximum 
extent practicable, that the Secretary make a finding within 90 days of 
receipt of a petition, as to whether or not substantial information 
indicates the requested action may be warranted. If such a finding is 
made, the Service is directed to commence a review of the status of the 
species. Within 12 months of receipt of a petition found to present 
substantial information, the Secretary is further directed to make a 
finding that the petitioned action is warranted, not warranted, or 
warranted but precluded. In this instance, the preparation of the 
proposed rule was nearly complete at the time the petition was received, 
thus alleviating the need to commence the status review that the Service 
would typically start in response to a petition. 

On August 3, 1993, the Service published a proposed rule in the 


Federal Register

 (58 FR 41231) to list the arroyo toad as endangered. 
That proposal was based primarily on information provided by the 
petitioners, published literature, and contacts with various 
herpetologists. 



Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



In the August 3, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications 
all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or 
information relevant to a final decision on the listing proposal. 
Appropriate state agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, 
scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted 
and requested to comment. Notice of the publication of the proposal was 
published in the 

Santa Barbara News Press

, 

Los Angeles Times

, and the 

San Diego Union Tribune

. Requests for a public hearing were received 
from four parties: the California Cattlemen's Association, the Newhall 
Land and Farming Company, Public Lands for the People, and United Water 
Conservation District. On September 9, 1993, the Service published a 
notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the hearing and extending the 
comment period until October 15, 1993 (58 FR 47428). The Service 
conducted a hearing on October 4, 1993, at the Minerals Management 
Service in Camarillo, California. Thirteen parties presented testimony. 

During the comment period, the Service received written and oral 
comments from 27 parties, including those of three Federal agencies, 
three State agencies, and 19 individuals or groups. The Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area (National Park Service), U.S. Forest 
Service, the U.S. National Biological Survey's National Ecology Research 
Center, Southwestern Herpetologists Society, Keep the Sespe Wild 
Committee, and the Environmental Defense Center were some of the eight 
commenters expressing support for the listing proposal. Sixteen 
commenters opposed the listing of the arroyo toad. Eight were neutral 
on the proposal but offered clarification or additional information. 
Written and oral statements obtained during the public hearing and 
comment period are combined in the following discussion. In addition, 
information submitted by the commenters, including updated locality and 
population data from the Cleveland, San Bernardino, and Los Padres 
National Forests, has been incorporated into this final rule. Opposing 
comments and other comments questioning the rule have been organized 
into specific issues. These issues and the Service's response to each 
are summarized as follows: 



Issue 1: 

One of the petitioners noted that the common name for the 
species, 

Bufo microscaphus

, is southwestern toad, whereas the common 
name of the subspecies, 

B. microscaphus californicus

, is arroyo toad. 
In the proposed rule the Service referred to 

B. microscaphus 
californicus

 as the arroyo southwestern toad. 



Service Response: 

The Service acknowledges the nomenclatural 
confusion in the proposed rule. The Service prefers to utilize common 
names of subspecies that also reflect the species to which it is 
presently assigned; such usage allows the general public to find 
information on both the full species and the listed subspecies. The 
common name of the subspecies appears as the ``arroyo southwestern 
toad'' in the rule but is usually referred to as the ``arroyo toad'' in 
the preamble text. 



Issue 2: 

Several commenters believed that there was insufficient 
scientific evidence to list the arroyo toad; that all the data on the 
species came from a single ``biased'' source; and that more studies 
should be conducted before a final decision on listing could be made.

Service Response

: In researching the proposed rule, the Service reviewed data and consulted publications from many sources, including
herpetologists at academic institutions, staff biologists with the U.S. Forest Service, research biologists within
the Fish and Wildlife Service, and museum records. It is the consensus of the herpetologists that contacted the Service
that the arroyo toad is one of the most threatened amphibians in southern California (see Issue 7). A recent report
prepared under contract to the California Department of Fish and Game stated that the combination of threats ``probably
make this taxon the most vulnerable in California'' (Jennings and Hayes 1992). In regard to recommendations that
more studies are needed before listing the arroyo toad, section 4 of the Act states that a determination to list must
be based on the best scientific and commercial data available after conducting a review of the status of the species.
The Service completed such a review of the toad in preparing the proposed rule and prior to the receipt of the petition.
The best scientific and commercial data now available supports listing the arroyo toad as endangered. 



Issue 3

: Several commenters believed that the proposed rule did not present any scientific evidence for the adverse effects
of mining, recreation, or grazing on arroyo toads. 



Service Response

: The proposed rule presented numerous examples of habitat degradation caused by mining, recreation, and grazing
(see Factor A in the proposed rule and this final rule). As stated in the proposed rule, mining, recreation, and grazing
have all been observed to alter microhabitat characteristics essential to successful breeding of arroyo toads.
Recreation and grazing are also implicated in mortality of adult and juvenile arroyo toads. As directed by the Act,
the Service used the best available scientific and commercial data in proposing to list the arroyo toad. These data
demonstrate the potential negative effects of these activities. Although the commenters do not agree with the conclusions
in the proposed rule, they did not submit any information to disprove the Service's analysis of the effects of mining,
grazing, or recreation on arroyo toad populations. 



Issue 4

: Several commenters stated that the listing of the arroyo toad should not proceed until the Service conducts the appropriate
National Environmental Policy Act review. 



Service Response

: The Service need not prepare environmental assessments or environmental impact statements pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for reasons outlined in the 

Federal Register 

on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). Basically, the listing of a species is exempt as a matter of law for NEPA review. Listing
decisions are based upon biological, not sociological or economical, considerations. This view has been upheld
in at least one court case (

Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus

, 657 F. 2d 829 (1981)) 



Issue 5

: One commenter was puzzled by the Service's statement in the proposed rule that ``little opportunity exists for natural
dispersal and recolonization following local extirpations,'' because volunteers of an off-road vehicle association
had recently offered to relocate toads into formerly occupied habitats. 



Service Response

: The Service's statement referred to the effects of habitat fragmentation on the viability of arroyo toad populations
and their ability to disperse naturally to reoccupy former habitat. The Service appreciates the offer for volunteer
help and will consider such offer in the recovery of the species. The reintroduction of arroyo toads into habitats
from which small, isolated populations had become extirpated would likely require frequent, intensive management
efforts. In most cases, such efforts would be unsuccessful, especially if the arroyo toads were placed in degraded
areas. Section 2 of the Endangered Species Act clearly states that the purpose of the Act is to provide a means whereby
the natural ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be conserved. However, such intensive
management actions may play a role in endangered species recovery, in addition to habitat protection. 



Issue 6

: One commenter stated that failure to designate critical habitat ``hampers the efforts of landowners and other interested
parties to locate additional populations of this species, possibly precluding the need for protection under the
act.'' 



Service Response

: Designation of critical habitat for the arroyo toad would not be prudent at this time. The arroyo toad is threatened
by taking, an activity difficult to control. Remaining populations of the arroyo toad are small and geographically
restricted, so that they are now vulnerable to unrestricted collection. Publication of specific localities, which
would be required in proposing critical habitat, would reveal precise locality data and thereby make the species
more vulnerable to additional collection and acts of vandalism, and increase the difficulties of enforcement. Designation
of critical habitat first focuses on known occupied habitat, which would not aid in locating additional populations.




Issue 7

: One commenter believed that the Service was not justified in keeping habitat and population data confidential,
because this practice ``does not allow for an independent assessment of the vulnerability of the species and the critical
need for listing.'' 



Service Response

: The proposed and final rules contain a complete summary of the data available to the Service regarding the status
of the arroyo toad. Habitat and population data have been available for review (see ``Addresses'' section above).
As discussed above (Issues 2 and 6), these data have been reviewed by the scientific community and there is a consensus
among herpetologists that the arroyo toad is one of the most threatened amphibians in California. 



Issue 8

: Several commenters referred to the economic impacts of listing the arroyo toad and recommended that the Service
not proceed with listing the species until the present and future economic impacts of listing had been considered.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Service Response

: Section 4 of the Act directs the Service to consider only the best scientific and commercial data available when making
a decision regarding the appropriateness of listing a species as endangered or threatened; economic impacts are
not considered in this evaluation. Economic factors are only to be considered in the designation of critical habitat.




Issue 9

: Several commenters contended that listing constitutes taking of private property by the Federal government without
compensation to the landowner. 



Service Response

: Listing of the arroyo toad under the Endangered Species Act will trigger the protective measures of section 9 of the
Act, prohibiting the take of this species. In addition, the Act requires that Federal agencies insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species, or destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat, if any is designated. Any activity on private land that requires Federal
involvement (such as a section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act) that may affect this species would have to be reviewed
by the Service to insure that the continued existence of the species would not be jeopardized. 

Listing under the Act does not imply that private land would be confiscated or taken without just compensation. Recovery
planning for the arroyo toad may include recommendations for land acquisition or easements involving private landowners.
These efforts only would be undertaken with the cooperation of the landowner. In the majority of cases, private landowners
are not precluded from using their land in the manner originally intended. 



Issue 10

: One commenter requested that the proposed listing of the arroyo toad be delayed until the Service could investigate
the possibility of implementing an arroyo toad hatchery and transplanting program. 



Service Response

: Section 2 of the Endangered Species Act states that the purpose of the Act is to provide a means whereby the ecosystems
upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be conserved. Captive breeding programs, such as the hatchery
proposed by the commenter, may be considered in planning for the recovery of some listed species but are not a substitute
for recovery of listed species in the wild. See the Service's response to Issue 5 above. 



Issue 11

: One commenter asked if the arroyo toad's decline is tied to the worldwide amphibian decline. 



Service Response

: The Endangered Species Act permits the listing of species that have become rare due to both natural and manmade factors.
The decline of the arroyo toad may be due in part to the as-yet-unknown factors causing the decline of amphibians throughout
the world. As summarized in the proposed rule, however, habitat degradation, predation by introduced species, and
the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms have played a significant role in the arroyo toad's decline. 



Issue 12

: One commenter stated that the decision to list the arroyo toad should be withheld until the genetic studies prove
that the arroyo toad is a distinct species. 



Service Response

: Section 3(15) of the Act states that ``(T)he term ``species'' includes any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants
.&blank;.&blank;. which interbreeds when mature.'' Therefore, for the purposes of the Act, this subspecies is treated
as a species. Determination of full species status is not necessary to proceed with listing the arroyo toad. 



Issue 13

: One commenter questioned the Service's preparation of a proposed rule prior to receipt of a petition. The commenter
suggested that this indicated impropriety, and an unacceptably close relationship with the petitioners, on the
part of the Service. 



Service Response

: Section 4(b) of the Act establishes two methods by which a species may be considered for listing. Section 4(b)(1)(A)
describes the process followed by the Service when the Service initiates a listing proposal. Section 4(b)(3)(A)
describes the process of initiating a listing action in response to a petition. In each case, the Service conducts
a status review of the species. A status review takes into account the best available scientific and commercial information,
including published reports and consultations with experts, regarding the species to determine if it should be provided
protection under the Act. In the case of the arroyo toad, as discussed above, the Service had completed a status review
of the species and drafted a proposed rule (pursuant to section 4(b)(1)(A)) before the petition was received. 



Issue 14

: Two commenters contended that adequate regulatory mechanisms are currently in place to protect the arroyo toad,
because the species occurs largely on National Forest lands. Therefore, any action that could affect the species
would undergo environmental review pursuant to National Environmental Policy Act. 



Service Response

: As stated in the proposed rule and this final rule, the arroyo toad has been extirpated from an estimated 75 percent
of its former range. Although a substantial proportion of currently occupied habitat is found on National Forest
lands, recovery of arroyo toads on privately owned lands will likely be necessary to restore the species to levels
that will permit removal from the endangered species list. The commenters are correct in stating that actions on Federal
lands would be subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, the objective of NEPA
is to ensure that Federal agencies consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.
The law does not guarantee that actions with significant impacts will not be authorized. Therefore, NEPA will be applied
to actions that affect the arroyo toad, but it does not assure protection for the species.

Issue 15: 

One commenter stated that listing will not alleviate the 
effect of exotic predators, which was identified in the proposed rule as 
one of the most severe threats to the survival of the arroyo toad. 



Service Response: 

The Act provides for the determination of 
endangered or threatened status to be based upon the five factors of 
section 4(a)(1) and not upon whether or not certain threats can be 
reduced or eliminated in a species' recovery. Section 4(f)(1) of the 
Act directs the Service to develop and implement a recovery plan for the 
conservation and survival of listed species. Most of the exotic 
predators are either game fish (e.g., bass, trout) or the bullfrog (see 
below). A recovery plan would address the reduction of some of the 
impacts from those predators through State and Federal actions. Section 
6 of the Act enables the Service to transfer funds to State endangered 
species conservation programs for implementation of actions that will 
further the conservation of the listed species. Thus, by listing the 
arroyo toad, guidance and funding can be provided for habitat 
management, including control of exotic predators in arroyo toad 
habitats. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



After a thorough review and consideration of all information 
available, the Service has determined that the arroyo toad should be 
classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of 
the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 
CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act 
were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or 
threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in 
section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the arroyo 
southwestern toad (

Bufo microscaphus californicus

) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range


Habitat destruction and alteration 
constitutes the most severe threat facing the arroyo toad. This toad is 
now confined to the headwaters of streams it occupied historically along 
their entire lengths. 

The arroyo toad was formerly found on rivers with near-perennial 
flow throughout southern California from San Luis Obispo County to San 
Diego County. It is believed to be extirpated in San Luis Obispo County 
(S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991). Populations persist in Santa Barbara, 
Ventura, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. Recent 
sightings of scattered individuals have been reported from Orange, San 
Bernardino, and southwest Imperial Counties. 

The majority of the remaining populations in Santa Barbara and 
Ventura Counties are located on the Los Padres National Forest. This 
National Forest supports the majority of southern California's remaining 
intact large river systems and maintains five viable populations of 
arroyo toads. Sespe Creek in Ventura County has the largest known 
population (Sweet 1992). Other populations are found on the Sisquoc, 
Santa Ynez, and upper and lower Piru drainages (Sweet 1992). 

Populations to the south are located primarily in San Diego and 
Riverside Counties and are predominantly found in the vicinity of the 
Cleveland National Forest and on private lands within or adjacent to 
national forest. In San Diego County, arroyo toads have been found on 
the Santa Margarita, Guejito, Sweetwater, Vallecito, San Luis Rey, Santa 
Ysabel, Witch, Cottonwood, Temescal, Agua Caliente, Santa Maria, 
Lusardi, Pine Valley, Noble, Kitchen, Long Potrero, Upper San Diego, San 
Vincente, and Morena drainages. Populations on Temescal, Agua Caliente, 
Pine Valley, and Cottonwood drainages may be considered viable (J. 
Stephenson, 

in litt.

, 1993; J. Copp, California Academy of Sciences, 

in 
litt.

, 1993). Recent surveys have located very small populations of 
arroyo toads in four creeks in southwestern Riverside County (Temecula, 
Arroyo Seco, San Mateo, and Tenaja Creeks) (J. Stephenson, 

in litt.

, 
1993). The single recent occurrence of arroyo toads in San Bernardino 
County is on Deep Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest. 

Several factors presently threaten the remaining 25 percent of the 
habitat of the arroyo toad including: (1) Short- and long-term changes 
in river hydrology, including construction of dams and water diversions; 
(2) alteration of riparian wetland habitats by agriculture and 
urbanization; (3) construction of roads; (4) site-specific damage by 
off-highway vehicle use; (5) development of campgrounds and other 
recreational activities; (6) over-grazing; and (7) mining activities.

Dam construction was responsible for the loss of approximately 40 
percent of the estimated original range of the arroyo toad. Twenty-six 
large impoundments are currently located within the range of this 
species, inundating over 190 km (120 miles) of suitable habitat. 
Additional areas have been identified as potential dam sites and, if 
constructed, would destroy 25 percent of the current range (6 to 7 
percent of the original range) of the arroyo toad (Sweet 1991a). 

In addition to habitat loss through direct inundation, dams can have 
significant effects on habitat quality downstream. Artificial flow 
regulation disrupts the natural processes that produce the terrace and 
pool habitats required by arroyo toads. Unseasonal water releases may 
prevent arroyo toads from breeding due to habitat changes (Sweet 1992). 

Another consequence of sustained unnatural perennial flows below 
dams is an adverse effect on the habitat of this species by encouraging 
vegetative growth in a riparian corridor, which increases ground 
stability and hence confines and deepens the creek channel. Water 
temperatures are reduced below the temperatures needed for larval 
development (Sweet 1991a). 

The arroyo toad is also sensitive to stream diversions as they cause 
the riparian areas to dry. Water diversions that alter normal flows 
have degraded habitats and adversely affected arroyo toads by leading 
to: (1) The early drying of breeding pools, causing breeding failures 
or loss of the larval population; (2) restriction of the period 
essential for rapid growth when newly-metamorphosed toads can forage on 
damp gravel bars; and (3) loss of damp subsurface soil, which may result 
in high adult mortality during late summer and early fall (Sweet 1992). 

Development projects in riparian wetlands have caused permanent 
losses of riparian habitats and are the most conspicuous factor in the 
decline of the arroyo toad (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991). Agriculture 
and urbanization have already destroyed much of the suitable arroyo toad 
habitat south of the Santa Clara River in Ventura County (S. Sweet, 
pers. comm., 1991). Stream terraces have been converted to farming, 
road corridors, and residential and commercial uses, while the streams 
themselves have been channelized for flood control. Large stretches of 
riparian corridor habitat have also been degraded or destroyed by cattle 
and feral pigs (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991). 

Recreational activities in riparian wetlands have had substantial 
negative effects to arroyo toad habitat and individuals, as discussed in 
Factor E. Off-highway vehicles cause extensive damage to the shallow 
pools in which arroyo toads breed (Sweet 1992). 

Streamside campgrounds in southern California national forests have 
frequently been located adjacent to arroyo toad habitat (Sweet 1992). 
In the Los Padres National Forest, each of the three campgrounds on Piru 
and Sespe Creeks were developed on terraces used by arroyo toads within 
50 to 100 meters (150 to 300 feet) of their breeding pools. On the 
upper Santa Ynez River, also in Los Padres National Forest, three of 
four campgrounds are also located in arroyo toad habitat (Sweet 1991a, 
1991b). The placement of campgrounds is similar in the Cleveland 
National Forest in San Diego County; upper San Juan Creek, upper San 
Luis Rey River, and Cottonwood Creek all have campgrounds situated 
adjacent to arroyo toad breeding habitats (M. Jennings, 

in litt.

, 1993). 

The use of heavy equipment in yearly reconstruction of roads and 
stream crossings in the national forests has had significant and 
repeated impacts to arroyo toads and toad habitat. Maintenance of the 
road to Ogilvy Ranch, a private inholding in the Los Padres National 
Forest, is likely responsible for a depressed population of arroyo toads 
in Mono Creek. The Ogilvy Ranch road makes 18 crossings of Mono Creek, 
many directly through or near arroyo toad breeding pools. In summer 
1992, the Los Padres National Forest declined to open the Ogilvy Ranch 
road in order to protect populations of arroyo toads and other candidate 
amphibians and reptiles. However, the road was opened with a bulldozer 
in the fall. As juvenile arroyo toads were likely burrowed in the soft 
sand adjacent to the creek, grading the road up the creek destroyed 
habitat and probably killed individual toads. Regular maintenance of 
roads in the Los Padres National Forest negatively affects arroyo toad 
individuals and toad habitat on the Santa Ynez River, Piru and Sespe 
Creeks, as well. 

Mining activities are an additional threat to this species. 
Recreational suction dredging for gold adversely affects toad habitat 
and individuals. Dredging destroys breeding pools used by arroyo toads 
and causes excessive siltation downstream, which asphyxiates eggs and 
small larvae. For example, during the Memorial Day weekend of 1991, 
four small dredges operating on Piru Creek (Los Padres National Forest) 
produced sedimentation visible more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) 
downstream and adversely affected 40,000 to 60,000 arroyo toad larvae. 
Subsequent surveys revealed nearly total destruction of the species in 
this stream section; fewer than 100 larvae survived, and only 4 juvenile 
toads were located (Sweet 1992). 

Several rivers in the Los Padres National Forest were recently 
temporarily closed to gold mining, and it is uncertain whether the ban 
will be made permanent. In December 1992, a group of miners challenged 
the Forest Service's authority to close Piru Creek to mining. These 
individuals practiced various methods of gold extraction until cited by 
the Forest Service. It is probable that future challenges will occur 
and, if successful, will threaten the population of arroyo toads on Piru 
Creek. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or 
Educational Purposes 



Populations of the arroyo toad are becoming so 
small and confined that even limited taking by campers, recreationists, 
and scientific researchers could adversely affect this species' 
viability. These toads are threatened from collecting by children near 
the campgrounds. No data exists on the extent of such collection 
activities, but it is probable that it continues to occur.

C. Disease or Predation



Over the past 20 years, at least 60 species of fishes have been introduced to the western U.S. States, 59 percent of which
are predatory (Hayes and Jennings 1986; Jennings 1988). The introduction of exotic predators to southern California
waters has been facilitated, in part, by the interbasin transport of water (e.g., California Aqueduct). Introduced
predators had substantial impacts on the sizes of extant populations of arroyo toads and may have contributed to regional
extinctions (Hayes and Jennings 1986). 

Virtually all rivers that contain or once contained arroyo toads 
support populations of introduced predatory fish, such as green sunfish 
(

Lepomis cyanellus

), largemouth bass (

Micropterous salmoides

), 
mosquitofish (

Gambusia affinis

), black bullhead (

Ictalurus nebulosus

), arroyo chub (

Gila orcutti

), prickly sculpin (

Cottus asper

), rainbow trout (

Oncorhynchus mykiss

), oriental gobies (

Tridentiger

 sp.), and red shiners (

Notropis lutrensis

) (Sweet 1992). All of these introduced fish prey on tadpoles and have been observed inducing high arroyo toad larval
mortality in breeding pools on the Piru, Sespe, and Santa Ynez drainages. It is probable that predation by introduced
fish species occurs elsewhere (Sweet 1992). 

Arroyo toads occur in streams with perennial or near perennial flow. 
Most streams with populations of arroyo toads also have populations of 
introduced bullfrogs (

Rana catesbeiana

). Adult bullfrogs are highly 
predatory and have been observed to prey on adult arroyo toads (Sweet 
1993). Habitat for bullfrogs has been enhanced within the existing 
range of the arroyo toad via diversions and artificially maintained 
perennial flows below dams. Increased bullfrog populations in these 
permanent water areas threaten the survival of arroyo toad populations. 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for administering section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Clean Water Act) and has authority to regulate the placement of dredged and 
fill materials into waters of the United States. Individual actions under nationwide permits undergo minimal outside
agency review. Individual permits, which are subject to more extensive review, are required for projects that affect
greater than 4 hectares (10 acres). 

The Corps cannot issue a nationwide or individual permit where a federally proposed or listed species may be affected,
without first conferring or consulting with the Service under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. In addition,
the Service, as part of the section 404 review process, provides comments on both pre-discharge notices for nationwide
permits and public notices for individual permits. 

Most construction projects in or near arroyo toad habitat would require a permit from the Corps pursuant to section
404 of the Clean Water Act. In practice, the Corps' actions under section 404 have not adequately protected arroyo
toads, as the Corps has rarely required individual permits where impacts to the toad would occur. The Corps has either
approved the projects under nationwide permits, or there have been repeated unauthorized activities. Federal listing
of this species will ensure greater consideration of the effects of permitted actions during the review process,
as well as provide the protection of section 7 of the Act. 

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) require an intensive
environmental review of projects that may adversely affect Federal candidate species. However, project proponents
are not required to avoid impacts to these species, and proposed mitigation measures are frequently not adequately
implemented. As with section 404 permits, the Service's comments through these environmental review processes
are only advisory. 

Forest Service policy, as described in the National Forest Management Act, states ``Fish and wildlife habitat shall
be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species in the planning
area'' (36 CFR 219.19). The Los Padres National Forest has recently funded studies on the ecology of arroyo toads (Sweet
1992, 1993). The Los Padres and Cleveland National Forests have begun to use this information to develop a riparian
habitat conservation strategy to provide better protection for arroyo toads and other sensitive riparian species
on the two forests. This positive step may address the impacts associated with road maintenance, off-highway vehicle
use, placer mining, recreation, and the issuance of special use permits for dam and water diversion construction,
all of which have contributed to the decline of the arroyo toad on national forests lands in southern California. Conservation
actions by the Forest Service and the State of California will assist in the recovery of the species. Recovery of the
species can not be assured, however, without the 
implementation of protective measures for arroyo toad populations on 
private lands. 

Alteration of the natural intermittent flow regimes by dams has had 
significant adverse impacts to arroyo toads. Prior to 1992, the California Department of Water Resources, which
operates Pyramid Dam on Piru Creek in the Los Padres and Angeles National Forests, frequently discharged excess flows
from the reservoir resulting in the depressed population of arroyo toads on lower Piru Creek. Recent coordination
among the Department of Water Resources, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service have resulted in releases
from the dam that more closely mimic natural flows, benefitting the arroyo toad. Water releases of several million
gallons per day from Barrett Dam on Cottonwood Creek during the period when larval arroyo toads were metamorphosing
negatively affected the population in San Diego County in 
summer 1993. 

Although the arroyo toad is classified as a ``Species of Special Concern'' by the State of California (Steinhart 1990)
and may not be taken without an approved scientific collecting permit, this designation provides no special, legally
mandated protection of the species and its habitat.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



Several other factors have also contributed to the decline of the species including drought, fire, and light and noise
pollution. Additionally, there has been direct mortality of the toads due to road construction and maintenance,
water inundation or drainage from dams and diversions, off-highway vehicle use, cattle and pig trampling, mining,
and recreational activities. 

By far, the most significant natural factor adversely affecting the arroyo toad is drought and resultant deterioration
of riparian habitats. Southern California recently experienced 5 consecutive years of lower than average rainfall.
These drought conditions, when combined with human-induced water reductions (i.e., diversions of water from streams),
have degraded riparian ecosystems and have created extremely stressful conditions for most aquatic species. 

Drought also affects arroyo toads in another manner. Female arroyo toads must feed for at least 2 months in order to
develop the fat reserves needed to produce a clutch of eggs (Sweet 1992). In drought years, females may find insufficient
insect prey to produce eggs before males cease their courtship behavior of calling, resulting in no reproduction
in that year. The extremely low reproduction of 1990 was likely due to 4 years of severe drought (Sweet 1992). Although
rainfall patterns in 1992 and 1993 returned to near normal levels, drought is a naturally recurring phenomenon in
southern California. There is no doubt that arroyo toads evolved with periodic, severe drought. However, the recurrence
of this natural event combined with the many manmade 
factors negatively affecting arroyo toad survival remains a significant threat to the species persistence. 

Periodic fires may adversely affect arroyo toads by causing direct mortality, destroying streamside vegetation,
or eliminating vegetation that sustains the watershed. Recent natural and human-induced wildfires had devastating
effects on populations of arroyo toads. The 1991 Lions Fire on upper Sespe Creek in the Los Padres National Forest destroyed
habitat containing the largest known extant population of arroyo toads including 15 known breeding pools and over
50 percent of the known adult population on the Sespe drainage (Sweet 1991c). Surveys in 1992 revealed that the effects
of the fire and subsequent flooding, erosion, and siltation caused the death of not less than 50 percent of the resident
adult population of arroyo toads. 

The vocalizations of male toads are crucial to the breeding success of this species, as their calls are the key factor
to finding mates. Light and noise pollution from adjacent developments or campgrounds may also reduce arroyo toad
reproductive success by disrupting the vocalization behavior of males during the breeding season (M. Jennings,


in litt.

, 1993). Generally, the local population of arroyo toads declines as campground use increases (Sweet 1992). 

Unseasonal water releases from dams may prevent arroyo toads from breeding altogether, as discussed in Factor A,
or may wash away eggs and larvae if releases are made after breeding has occurred (Sweet 1992). For example, large unscheduled
releases from Pyramid Lake in May 1991 virtually eliminated all reproduction by arroyo toads below the dam in Piru
Creek in what would have been the best year for reproduction following 5 years of drought (Sweet 1992). A proposal to
convey State Water Project water from Pyramid Lake to Piru Lake via Piru Creek would also threaten arroyo toad survival
on Piru Creek, if releases substantially alter natural flow regimes. 

Grazing brings another potential source of mortality to this species. Horses and cattle graze in riparian areas and
may trample eggs and larvae of arroyo toads (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991). Grazing also increases levels of sedimentation
in streams that can smother eggs and larvae (M. Jennings, 

in litt.

, 1993) 

Off-highway vehicle use is believed to be the primary factor responsible for the decimation of the Mojave River population
of the arroyo toad (Jennings 1991). On Memorial Day weekend in 1991, a fence protecting a breeding pool on Piru Creek
was cut, and off-highway vehicles had access to the creek. The disturbance destroyed a small sand bar that maintained
a shallow pool, resulting in the loss of 12,000 to 16,000 arroyo southwestern tadpoles (Sweet 1992). 

Recreational use of campgrounds is heaviest in early summer, when arroyo toad larvae and juveniles are present and
most vulnerable. As the young toads are diurnal, sedentary, and live on the sand bars, they are often crushed. Recreational
use has resulted in the alteration of stream and breeding pool morphology and trampling of juvenile toads (Sweet 1992).
Adult arroyo toads, which forage in open areas in the campgrounds, are frequently killed on campground roads at night
(Sweet 1992; M. Jennings, 

in litt.

, 1993). 

Habitat loss, high mortality, and low reproduction from all of the 
sources discussed above also result in the fragmentation of surviving 
populations into isolated subpopulations. While these subpopulations 
may continue to survive and reproduce over the short term, their long-
term survival is not secure, because little 
opportunity exists for natural dispersal and recolonization following 
local extirpations (Sweet 1991a). Habitat fragmentation increases the 
probability of local extirpation due to stochastic events and also 
likely results in reduction of genetic variability within the small, 
isolated subpopulations. 

The recent years of extremely low reproductive success have likely 
been a bottleneck in the remaining populations of arroyo toads, in which 
few individuals will reach sexual maturity until 1995 (Sweet 1992). As 
mature adults age and die in the next 2 years, little recruitment into 
the breeding population is likely, and numerous local extinctions of 
already small populations are probable. As individuals may not survive 
and reproduce due to detrimental events such as drought or road 
maintenance, and, as the population numbers are low and the range is 
restricted, such events could cause the extinction of the species.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present and future 
threats faced by the arroyo toad in determining to make this final 
rule. The arroyo toad has been extirpated from a substantial portion of 
its historic range. Virtually all remaining populations are small and 
face a variety of immediate threats to their continued viability. This 
toad lives in highly specialized habitats that have been and will 
continue to be targeted for development and degradation by human 
activities and is extremely vulnerable to habitat modification and water 
quality changes. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to 
list the arroyo toad as endangered. Other alternatives to this action 
were considered but not preferred because not listing this species at 
all or listing it as threatened would not be in keeping with the 
purposes of the Act. For the reasons discussed below, critical habitat 
is not being proposed at this time. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires to the maximum extent prudent 
and determinable that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the 
time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The 
Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently 
prudent for the arroyo toad. 
As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting 
the Species,'' the arroyo toad is threatened by taking, an activity 
difficult to control. Remaining populations of the arroyo toad are 
small and geographically restricted, so that they are now vulnerable to 
unrestricted collection. Publication of specific localities, which 
would be required in proposing critical habitat, would reveal precise 
locality data and, thereby, make the species more vulnerable to 
additional collection and acts of vandalism and increase the 
difficulties of enforcement. 
The Forest Service has been notified of the locations and importance 
of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species' 
habitat will be addressed in the recovery process and through the 
section 7 consultation process. Therefore, it would not now be prudent 
to determine the critical habitat of the arroyo toad. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions 
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies; 
groups; and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for 
possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires 
that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The 
protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against 
taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that 
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or 
adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency 
must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 
The Forest Service (Department of Agriculture) and the Corps 
(Department of Defense) are the main Federal agencies that will be 
required to protect this species if it is listed. Federal agencies must 
consult with the Service, as described in section 7 of the Act, on any 
project that may affect this species. The Forest Service harbors a 
substantial portion of known arroyo toad populations; hence, some of 
Forest Service actions within the species' habitat may be affected. 
Forest Service activities, such as the construction and maintenance of 
roads, and the issuance of special use permits for dam and bridge 
construction, mining, and water diversion projects would be subject to 
the Act's section 7 requirements. Corps activities or issuances of 
permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act would be subject 
to the Endangered Species Act section 7 requirements. Any Federal 
actions that are subject to environmental review under the National 
Environmental Policy Act may be subject to the requirements of section 7 
of the Act. 
Listing of the arroyo toad as endangered will provide for the 
development of a recovery plan. Such a plan will bring together both 
State and Federal efforts for its conservation. The plan will establish 
a framework for cooperation and coordination among agencies in 
conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and 
estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It will 
also describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve 
conservation and survival of the arroyo toad. 
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth 
a series of prohibitions and exceptions that apply to endangered 
wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes 
harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or 
collect; or attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in 
interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or 
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed 
wildlife species. It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, 
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. 
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation 
agencies.

It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the 
maximum extent practicable those activities that would or would not 
constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act at the time of listing. 
The intent of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect 
of this listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' 
range. For further information, contact the Field Supervisor (see 
``

Addresses

'' section). During the public comment period inquiries were 
made as to the effect listing would have on the mining industry, water 
projects, and recreational activities. The Service believes that, based 
on the best available information, the following actions will not result 
in a violation of section 9, provided these activities are carried out 
in accordance with existing regulations and permit requirements: 
momentary moving of individual adult toads out of danger (e.g., road, 
path); release, diversion, or withdrawal of water in a manner that does 
not displace tadpoles or eggs or disrupt breeding of adults; normal 
lighting and noises around campgrounds; and non-destructive recreational 
use of breeding habitat outside of the breeding period (January through 
May). 
Activities that the Service believes could potentially result in the 
take of the arroyo toad, include, but are not limited to, unauthorized 
collecting or capture of the species, except as noted above to 
momentarily move an individual out of harm's way; introduction of exotic 
species into occupied habitat (e.g., fish, other species of toads); 
unauthorized destruction/alteration of the species' habitat (e.g., in- 
stream dredging, rock removal, channelization, discharge of fill 
material, operation of any vehicles within the stream channel); 
violation of a construction, discharge or withdrawal permit that affects 
occupied habitat; pesticide applications affecting occupied habitat in 
violation of label restrictions; or other illegal discharges or dumping 
of toxic chemicals, silt, or other pollutants into waters supporting the 
species. 
Other unauthorized activities not identified in the above two 
paragraphs will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if a 
violation of section 9 of the Act may have occurred. The Service does 
not consider these lists to be exhaustive and provides them for the 
information of the public. 
The Act and 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 also provide for the issuance of 
permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving 
endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Such permits 
are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or 
survival of the species, and for incidental take in connection with 
otherwise lawful activities. Requests for copies of the regulations on 
listed wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species 
Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).

Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues regulations to delay the opening of the first (roe) directed fishing season for the 1995 offshore component
pollock fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) by delaying the opening of the trawl
fishery, the only gear type used in the fishery, from January 20 to January 26. This action is necessary to increase
the likelihood of harvesting pollock when roe quality is optimum and thus increase revenues from the BSAI pollock
processed by the offshore component during the roe season. The regulations also prohibit vessels used to fish for
BSAI or Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore
component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery
does not apply to vessels used to fish exclusively in the Western Alaska Community Development Quota (CDQ) program
prior to January 26 and is necessary to discourage participants in the offshore component pollock fishery from contributing
to increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season. These actions
are intended to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish
Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area.

Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by NMFS according to the FMP
for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and is implemented by regulations
governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620, 675, 676, and 677. 

Regulations at 50 CFR 675.23(e) establish two fishing seasons for BSAI pollock. The first (roe) directed fishing
season extends from January 1 until April 15. The second (nonroe) season extends from August 15 through the end of the
fishing year. Since 1992, regulations at &sect;673.23(d) have prohibited fishing for groundfish with trawl gear
until January 20 of each fishing year (57 FR 381, January 6, 1992). Nontrawl fisheries for pollock do not exist. 

This action delays the opening date of the 1995 offshore component directed pollock roe trawl fishery in the BSAI from
January 20 to January 26 to increase the likelihood of harvesting pollock when roe quality is optimum. The large harvesting
capacity in the offshore component has resulted in a fast-paced fishery of decreasing duration (in 1994 the directed
trawl fishery was opened for a 29-day period from January 20 until February 18) that, in the past, has closed before
the period of prime roe quality, which peaks between the 10th and 20th of February. This delay of the offshore component
pollock roe fishery (all gear) will increase the likelihood that the offshore component season will encompass the
time period of prime roe quality. 

This action also prohibits vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January
26 from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry
into the offshore component fishery does not apply to vessels used to fish exclusively in the BSAI pollock CDQ program
prior to January 26. This prohibition is intended to discourage a shift in fishing effort into other fisheries by pollock
vessels prior to January 26. 

A proposed rule to implement this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 September 26, 1994 (59 FR 49051). Comment on the proposed rule was invited through October 26, 1994. Two letters were
received in support of the proposed action and one letter was received in opposition. The three letters are summarized
in the Response to Comments section, below. 

NMFS has determined that a delay of the offshore component pollock roe season is consistent with the Magnuson Act and
has approved it. The necessity for and description of this action are explained further in the preamble to the proposed
rule. This season delay is effective only through December 31, 1995, when regulations authorizing the allocation
of pollock between the inshore and offshore component expire.

Three letters were received within the comment period. A summary of the comments and NMFS' response follows: 


Comment 1.

 The proposed delay of the roe season for the offshore component pollock fishery will have a positive economic effect
by increasing the chance that pollock will be harvested when roe quality and yield are best and the price is highest.



Response.

 NMFS agrees that a delay of the offshore component pollock roe season should have positive economic benefits and has
approved the action. 


Comment 2.

 The proposed 10-day delay of the opening date to February 5 for nonCDQ vessels that are used to participate in other
fisheries before January 26 sufficiently addresses concerns about the potential for increased fishing effort in
other fisheries prior to this date. 


Response.

 The proposed rule requires vessel owners/operators to choose between participating in the offshore component pollock
fishery during the period January 26 through February 5 or participating in other fisheries between January 20, the
start of the BSAI trawl season, and January 26. Those vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI crab prior
to January 26 are prohibited from entering the offshore pollock roe season until February 5. This prohibition does
not apply to vessels used to participate exclusively in the BSAI pollock CDQ program prior to January 26. NMFS agrees
that this prohibition addresses the intent of the Council to significantly reduce the incentive to participants
in the offshore pollock fishery to enter other fisheries prior to January 26. This prohibition, therefore, was approved
as part of the rule implementing the proposed delay of the offshore pollock roe fishery. 


Comment 3.

 The proposed action precludes pollock catcher vessels from participating in other fisheries prior to January 26
simply because they choose to participate in the offshore component pollock roe fishery. As a result, the proposed
action takes away fishing opportunity that currently exists and should not be implemented at this time. 


Response.

 NMFS acknowledges that limitations on the participation in other fisheries prior to the opening of the offshore pollock
fishery could reduce potential revenues of vessels used to target on more than one species during the pollock roe season.
This rule prohibits vessels from participating in other fisheries prior to January 26 if the vessels' owners/operators
wish to participate in the offshore component pollock fishery prior to February 5. Nonetheless, NMFS has approved
this limitation after considering the intent of the Council to minimize the preemptive impact on other fisheries
that could have otherwise resulted from the delay of the offshore pollock roe fishery. 


Changes From the Proposed Rule 


This final rule has been corrected to redesignate paragraphs to correspond to Federal Register format. The final
rule also is revised from the proposed rule to clarify the intent that vessels used to participate in the CDQ pollock
fishery before January 26 are not subject to the 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component pollock fishery
for vessels used to fish for BSAI or GOA groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26. 


Classification 


NMFS prepared a FRFA as a part of the RIR. A copy of this analysis is available from NMFS (See 

ADDRESSES

). 
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). By virtue of that membership,
the USPS adheres to the agreements of the UPU to which it is signatory. Specifically, the Universal Postal Convention
(Convention), the Postal Parcels Agreement (Parcels Agreement), and the Money Orders Agreement contain provisions
concerning the fees member countries can charge for special mail services.


The Convention provides charges for (1) nonstandard letters, (2) inquiries, (3) return receipts, (4) registered
mail service, (5) special delivery (EXPR&Egrave;S), (6) restricted delivery, and (7) recorded delivery; the Parcels
Agreement provides charges for insured mail service; and the Money Orders Agreement provides charges for international
money orders. The charges provided in these agreements are less than the USPS charges for the equivalent domestic
service. The agreements authorize member countries whose internal service charges are higher than those that are
fixed in the agreements to apply their domestic charges in the international service.
The USPS charges international special service fees that are the same as the equivalent domestic special service
fees to avoid having international fees that are less than those charged domestically. Accordingly, the USPS is adjusting
international special service fees concurrently with the changes adopted by the Governors of the Postal Service
as a result of the current proceedings before the Postal Rate Commission.
This notice does not address charges for services that do not have corresponding domestic service. These charges
will be addressed in a separate notice in conjunction with anticipated adjustments in international postage rates.
The Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553).
The Postal Service adopts the following rates and fees:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 8, 1994, the Postal Service filed, pursuant to chapter 36, title 39, United States Code, a request with the
Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on changes in rates of postage and fees for domestic postal services.
An explanation of the Postal Service proposal with an invitation to participate in Commission Docket No. R94&hyph;1
was published in the 

Federal Register

 by the Postal Rate Commission on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12996&hyph;13016). 



On November 30, 1994, the Postal Rate Commission issued an Opinion and Recommended Decision in Docket No. R94&hyph;1.
In its Recommended Decision, the Commission recommended changes in the rates of postage and fees for domestic postal
services. 

In a decision adopted on December 12, 1994, the Governors of the Postal Service allowed the Commission's recommended
changes in rates and fees to take effect under protest. The Governors ordered these changes into effect on a permanent
basis, pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3625. Also on December 12, 1994, the Board of Governors determined that these changes
would become effective at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1995. (The Governors' decision, the record of the Commission's
hearings, and the Commission's Opinion and Recommended Decision may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The Governors' decision and the Commission's Opinion and
Recommended Decision are available for inspection in the Library at Headquarters, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant
Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20260&hyph;1641.) 

In accordance with these actions by the Governors and the Board of Governors, the Postal Service hereby gives notice
that the domestic rate and fee changes listed below become effective at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Domestic Mail Manual Revisions to Implement Changes in Postal Rates and Fees </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As announced elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, new domestic postal rates and fees will take effect on January 1, 1995. Implementing standards for these rate and
fee changes have been developed and are set forth below. Although they are to take effect on January 1, 1995, comments
on these standards are solicited, and any proposed changes will be considered and acted upon as appropriate.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 January 1, 1995.

 
</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Mail or deliver written comments to the Manager, Mailing Standards, USPS Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington,
DC 20260&hyph;2419. Copies of all written comments will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 5610 at the above address.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 12, 1994, the Governors of the Postal Service allowed the changes in rates and fees contained in the Opinion
and Recommended Decision of the Postal Rate Commission in Docket No. R94&hyph;1 to take effect under protest. The
Board of Governors ordered these changes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1995. More information about Docket
No. R94&hyph;1 and the process that produced the Governors' action is contained in the notice mentioned above, published
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 


Accordingly, the Postal Service has amended its Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards to incorporate these revised
rates and fees. A complete revision to DMM Module R, Rates and Fees, appears below, and will be included in DMM Issue
48, to be published in early 1995. Since Docket No. R94&hyph;1 did not include changes in mail classification or in
the content (other than the monetary value) or structure of postage rates and fees, no other DMM revisions are necessary
to implement the Governors' decision. 
The Postal Service has also amended its domestic mailing statements to reflect the revised rates for postage; a complete
set of those forms follows the DMM revision. Nonsubstantive format changes have also been made at this time, primarily
to accommodate inclusion of a Centralized Trust Accounting System (CTAS) identification number on permit imprint
mailing (&hyph;N and &hyph;R suffix) statements and to amend how postage is reported for postage affixed mailing
(&hyph;PC suffix) statements. 
The revised DMM standards, a revised Notice 123, Ratefold, the revised domestic mailing statements, and miscellaneous
implementation instructions for postal employees will be contained in a special Postal Bulletin being issued in
the near future. In addition to copies prepared for standard distribution to postal employees and public subscribers,
bulk quantities of the special Postal Bulletin are being provided to most post offices. Production and distribution
of the special Postal Bulletin and the revised mailing statements began immediately following the Governors' action
to implement revised domestic rates, so copies of these documents should become available in late December or early
January. While each receiving postal facility will determine and manage redistribution of the special Postal Bulletin,
interested customers may contact the manager, business mail entry, for the district in which they are located. (A
list of these persons and the ZIP Code areas they service is contained in DMM G042.) Until the new mailing statements
are available, the current versions may be used with appropriate amendments, or the illustrations of the revised
forms (published in the special Postal Bulletin) may be photocopied and completed. 


List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 


Postal Service.

 

For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual,
which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111). 


PART 111_[AMENDED] 


1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001&hyph;3011, 3201&hyph;3219, 3403&hyph;3406, 3621, 3626, 5001.

National Priorities List for Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Sites 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''),
as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include
a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,
or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. 



This rule adds 18 new sites to the NPL, 14 to the General Superfund Section and 4 to the Federal Facilities Section. The
identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''
or ``the Agency'') in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of public
health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed remedial action(s),
if any, may be appropriate. The NPL is not intended to define the boundaries of a site or to determine the extent of contamination
(see Section II, subsection, ``Facility Boundaries''). This action results in an NPL of 1,242 sites, 1,088 of them
in the General Superfund Section and 154 of them in the Federal Facilities Section. An additional 46 sites are proposed,
40 in the General Superfund Section and 6 in the Federal Facilities Section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288.




</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 The effective date for this amendment to the NCP shall be January 17, 1995. CERCLA section 305 provides for a legislative
veto of regulations promulgated under CERCLA. Although 

INS

 v. 

Chadha

, 462 U.S. 919,103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983) cast the validity of the legislative veto into question, EPA has transmitted a
copy of this regulation to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives. If any action by
Congress calls the effective date of this regulation into question, the Agency will publish a notice of clarification
in the 

Federal Register

.

I. Introduction 


Background 


In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.
9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA
was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99&hyph;499,
stat. 1613 

et seq.

 To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan
(``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316
(46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases
and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several
occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). 

Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases
or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action *&blank;*&blank;*
and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking
removal action.'' Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to releases or threats
of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA section 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in
nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA section 101(24)).


Pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA has promulgated a list of national priorities
among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United
States. That list, which is Appendix B of 40 CFR Part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). 

CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.''
The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably
as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' 

CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo remedial action
financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') only after it is placed
on the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). However, under 40 CFR 300.425(b)(2) placing a site on the
NPL ``does not imply that monies will be expended.'' EPA may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the releases,
including enforcement action under CERCLA and other laws.

Three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action are included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)
(55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high
on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 300. On December 14, 1990
(55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The
revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening
device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances to pose a threat to human health or
the environment. As a matter of Agency policy, those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the
NPL.

Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless
of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable,
the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest
danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State.

The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed regardless
of their HRS score, if all of the following conditions are met: 
&bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a
health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release.

&bull;EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health.

&bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (available only at NPL sites)
than to use its removal authority to respond to the release.

EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then,
most recently on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27989).

The NPL includes two sections, one of sites that are evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''),
and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive
Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987) and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying
out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible
for preparing an HRS score and determining whether the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these
sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section
includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency.



Deletions/Cleanups 



EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP
at 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 67 sites from the General Superfund
Section of the NPL, most recently Yakima Plating Co., Yakima, Washington (59 FR 43291, August 23, 1994); Wide Beach
Development, Brant, New York (59 FR 44633, August 30, 1994); Revere Textile Prints Corp., Sterling, Connecticut
(59 FR 45628, September 2, 1994); North-U Drive Well Contamination, Springfield, Missouri (59 FR 46354, September
8, 1994); BioClinical Laboratories, Inc., Bohemia, New York (59 FR 46569, September 9, 1994); C &amp; J Disposal Leasing
Co. Dump, Hamilton, New York (59 FR 48178, September 20, 1994); Ringwood Mines/Landfill, Ringwood Borough, New Jersey
(59 FR 54830, November 2, 1994); and Allied Plating, Inc., Portland, Oregon (59 FR 56409, November 14, 1994).

EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites
and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify
for the CCL when: 




(1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have
been achieved; 
(2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g.,
institutional controls); or 
(3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL.




Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance.

In addition to the 66 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research
and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional
213 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but two from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of December 1994, the CCL consists
of 279 sites.

Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of November 1994, EPA
had conducted 648 removal actions at NPL sites, and 2,331 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals
is available from the Superfund hotline.



Action in This Rule 



This final rule adds 18 sites to the NPL, 14 to the General Superfund Section and 4 to the Federal Facilities Section.
This action results in an NPL of 1,242 sites, 1,088 of them in the General Superfund Section and 154 of them in the Federal
Facilities Section. An additional 46 sites have been proposed, 40 in the General Superfund Section and 6 in the Federal
Facilities Section, and are awaiting final Agency action. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288.



Information Available to the Public 



The Headquarters and Regional public dockets for the NPL contain documents relating to the evaluation and scoring
of sites in this final rule. The dockets are available for viewing, by appointment only, after the appearance of this
notice. The hours of operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding Federal holidays. Please contact the Regional Dockets for hours.

The Headquarters docket for this rule contains HRS score sheets for the final sites; Documentation Records for the
sites describing the information used to compute the scores; pertinent information regarding statutory requirements
or EPA listing policies that affect the sites; a list of documents referenced in each of the Documentation Records;
comments received; and the Agency's responses to those comments. The Agency's responses are contained in the ``Support
Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_December 1994.''

Each Regional docket contains all the information in the Headquarters docket, plus the actual reference documents
containing the data principally relied upon by EPA in calculating or evaluating the HRS score for the site. These reference
documents are available only in the Regional dockets.

Interested parties may view documents, by appointment only, in the Headquarters or Regional Dockets, or copies may
be requested from the Headquarters or Regional Dockets. An informal written request, rather than a formal request
under the Freedom of Information Act, should be the ordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents.



II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL


Purpose



The legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96&hyph;848,
96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)) states the primary purpose of the NPL:




The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities
and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or site on the list does
not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities of its owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake
any action, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent government action in the form of remedial actions
or enforcement actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriate procedural
safeguards.




The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management tool. The identification
of a site for the NPL is intended to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the
nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed
remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites that EPA believes
warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may, to the extent potentially responsible parties are identifiable
at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financed remedial action.


Implementation



After initial discovery of a site at which a release or threatened release may exist, EPA begins a series of increasingly
complex evaluations. The first step, the Preliminary Assessment (PA), is a low-cost review of existing information
to determine if the site poses a threat to the public health or the environment. If the site presents a serious imminent
threat, EPA may take immediate removal action. If the PA shows that the site presents a threat but not an imminent threat,
EPA generally will perform a more extensive study called the Site Inspection (SI). The SI involves collecting additional
information to better understand the extent of the problem at the site, screen out sites that will not qualify for the
NPL, and obtain data necessary to calculate an HRS score for sites that warrant placement on the NPL and further study.
To date EPA has completed approximately 37,000 PAs and approximately 18,000 SIs.

The NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1) limits expenditure of the Trust Fund for remedial actions to sites on the NPL. However,
EPA may take enforcement actions under CERCLA or other applicable statutes against responsible parties regardless
of whether the site is on the NPL; although, as a practical matter, the focus of EPA's CERCLA enforcement actions has
been and will continue to be on NPL sites. Similarly, in the case of CERCLA removal actions, EPA has the authority to
act at any site, whether listed or not, that meets the criteria of the NCP at 40 CFR 300.415(b)(2) (55 FR 8842, March 8,
1990).

<TEXT>
 

EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using all the appropriate response and/or enforcement actions available
to the Agency, including authorities other than CERCLA. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis whether to
take enforcement or other action under CERCLA or other authorities prior to undertaking response action, to proceed
directly with Trust Fund-financed response actions and seek to recover response costs after cleanup, or do both.
To the extent feasible, once sites are on the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for CERCLA-financed
response action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federal initiatives. EPA will take into account
which approach is more likely to accomplish cleanup of the site most expeditiously while using CERCLA's limited resources
as efficiently as possible.
Although it is a factor that is considered, the ranking of sites by HRS scores does not by itself determine the sequence
in which EPA funds remedial response actions, since the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient
to determine either the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site (40 CFR 300.425(a)(2),
55 FR 8845). Additionally, resource constraints may preclude EPA from evaluating all HRS pathways; only those presenting
significant environmental risk and sufficient to make a site eligible for the NPL may be evaluated. Moreover, the
sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly
on the basis of ranking would in some cases require stopping work at sites where it already was underway. In addition,
certain sites are based on other criteria.
More detailed studies of a site are undertaken in the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (``RI/FS'') that
typically follows listing. The purpose of the RI/FS is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the
extent necessary to select a remedy (40 CFR 300.430(a)(2)). The RI/FS takes into account the amount of contaminants
released into the environment, the risk to affected populations and environment, the cost to remediate contamination
at the site, and the response actions that have been taken by potentially responsible parties or others. Decisions
on the type and extent of response action to be taken at these sites are made in accordance with 40 CFR 300.415 and 40 CFR
300.430.
After conducting these additional studies, EPA may conclude that initiating a CERCLA remedial action using the Trust
Fund at some sites on the NPL is not appropriate because of more pressing needs at other sites, or because a private party
cleanup already is underway pursuant to an enforcement action. Given the limited resources available in the Trust
Fund, the Agency must carefully balance the relative needs for response at the numerous sites it has studied. It is
also possible that EPA will conclude after further analysis that the site does not warrant remedial action.


RI/FS at Proposed Sites


An RI/FS may be performed at sites proposed in the 

Federal Register

 for placement on the NPL (or even sites that have not been proposed for placement on the NPL) pursuant to the Agency's
removal authority under CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.415. Although an RI/FS generally is conducted
at a site after it has been placed on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conduct an RI/FS at a site
proposed for placement on the NPL in preparation for a possible Superfund-financed response action, such as when
the Agency believes that a delay may create unnecessary risks to public health or the environment. In addition, the
Agency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conduct a removal or enforcement action at a site.


Facility (Site) Boundaries


The Agency's position is that the NPL does not describe releases in precise geographical terms, and that it would be
neither feasible nor consistent with the limited purpose of the NPL (as the mere identification of releases), for
it to do so.
CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list national priorities among the known ``releases or threatened releases''
of hazardous substances. Thus, the purpose of the NPL is merely to identify releases of hazardous substances that
are priorities for further evaluation. Although a CERCLA ``facility'' is broadly defined to include any area where
a hazardous substance release has ``come to be located'' (CERCLA section 101(9)), the listing process itself is not
intended to define or reflect the boundaries of such facilities or releases. Of course, HRS data upon which the NPL
placement was based will, to some extent, describe which release is at issue. That is, the NPL site would include all
releases evaluated as part of that HRS analysis (including noncontiguous releases evaluated under the NPL aggregation
policy, described at 48 FR 40663 (September 8, 1983)).
EPA regulations provide that the ``nature and extent of the threat presented by a release'' will be determined by an
RI/FS as more information is developed on site contamination (40 CFR 300.68(d)). During the RI/FS process, the release
may be found to be larger or smaller than was originally known, as more is learned about the source and the migration
of the contamination. However, this inquiry focuses on an evaluation of the threat posed; the boundaries of the release
need not be defined, and in any event are independent of the NPL listing. Moreover, it generally is impossible to discover
the full extent of where the contamination ``has come to be located'' before all necessary studies and remedial work
are completed at a site. Indeed, the boundaries of the contamination can be expected to change over time. Thus, in most
cases, it will be impossible to describe the boundaries of a release with certainty.

<DOCNO> FR941216-0-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For these reasons, the NPL need not be amended if further research into the extent of the contamination expands the
apparent boundaries of the release. Further, the NPL is only of limited significance, as it does not assign liability
to any party or to the owner of any specific property. See Report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,
Senate Rep. No. 96&hyph;848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980), quoted at 48 FR 40659 (September 8, 1983). If a party contests
liability for releases on discrete parcels of property, it may do so if and when the Agency brings an action against
that party to recover costs or to compel a response action at that property.
At the same time, however, the RI/FS or the Record of Decision (which defines the remedy selected, 40 CFR 300.430(f))
may offer a useful indication to the public of the areas of contamination at which the Agency is considering taking
a response action, based on information known at that time. For example, EPA may evaluate (and list) a release over
a 400-acre area, but the Record of Decision may select a remedy over 100 acres only. This information may be useful to
a landowner seeking to sell the other 300 acres, but it would result in no formal change in the fact that a release is included
on the NPL. The landowner (and the public) also should note in such a case that if further study (or the remedial construction
itself) reveals that the contamination is located on or has spread to other areas, the Agency may address those areas
as well.
This view of the NPL as an initial identification of a release that is not subject to constant re-evaluation is consistent
with the Agency's policy of not rescoring NPL sites:



EPA recognizes that the NPL process cannot be perfect, and it is possible that errors exist or that new data will alter
previous assumptions. Once the initial scoring effort is complete, however, the focus of EPA activity must be on investigating
sites in detail and determining the appropriate response. New data or errors can be considered in that process .&blank;.&blank;.
[T]he NPL serves as a guide to EPA and does not determine liability or the need for response. (49 FR 37081 (September
21, 1984).

III. Contents of This Final Rule


This final rule adds 18 sites to the NPL, 14 to the General Superfund Section (Table 1) and 4 to the Federal Facilities
Section (Table 2). Proposal 

#

12 (57 FR 4824, February 7, 1992) provided 3 sites, Proposal 

#

13 (57 FR 47204, October 14, 1992) provided 3 sites, Proposal 

#

14 (58 FR 27507, May 10, 1993) provided 4 sites, Proposal 

#

16 (59 FR 2568, January 18, 1994) provided 2 sites, and Proposal 

#

17 (59 FR 43314, August 23, 1994) provided 6 sites; all are being added to the NPL based on HRS scores of 28.50 or greater.
As discussed more fully below, the following tables present the sites in this rule arranged alphabetically by State
and identifies their rank by group number. Group numbers are determined by arranging the NPL by rank and dividing it
into groups of 50 sites. For example, a site in Group 4 has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the
fourth group of 50 sites on the NPL.

Name Changes 


EPA is changing the name of the American Shizuki/Ogallala Electronics Co. site in Ogallala, Nebraska, to Ogallala
Ground Water Contamination. EPA is also changing the name of Lake Elmo Airport/Ground Water Contamination in Baytown
Township, Minnesota, to Baytown Township Ground Water Plume. EPA believes these name changes more accurately reflect
the sites. 


Public Comments 


EPA reviewed all comments received on sites included in this rule. The formal comment period ended on April 7, 1992
for sites from Proposal 

#

12; December 14, 1992 for sites from Proposal 

#

13; July 9, 1993 for sites from Proposal 

#

14; March 21, 1994 for sites from Proposal 

#

16; and October 24, 1994 for sites from Proposal 

#

17 with two exceptions. The comment period for Agriculture Street Landfill ended on November 7, 1994, and the comment
period for Escambia Wood_Pensicola ended on November 23, 1994. 
Based on comments received on the proposed sites, as well as investigation by EPA and the States (generally in response
to comment), EPA recalculated the HRS scores for individual sites where appropriate. EPA's response to site-specific
public comments and explanations of any score changes made as a result of such comments are addressed in the ``Support
Document for the Revised National Priorities List Final Rule_December 1994''. EPA received no comments for a number
of the sites included in this rule. 


Statutory Requirements 


CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among'' the known releases or threatened releases
of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain
enumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for possible
remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA has chosen not to place certain types of sites
on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later determines that sites not
listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may place them on the NPL. 
The listing policies and statutory requirements of relevance to this final rule cover sites subject to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'') (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6991i) and Federal facility sites. These policies
and requirements are explained below and have been explained in greater detail in previous rulemakings (56 FR 5598,
February 11, 1991). 


Releases From Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sites



EPA's policy is that non-Federal sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities will not, in general,
be placed on the NPL. However, EPA will list certain categories of RCRA sites subject to Subtitle C corrective action
authorities, as well as other sites subject to those authorities, if the Agency concludes that doing so best furthers
the aims of the NPL/RCRA policy and the CERCLA program. EPA has explained these policies in detail in the past (51 FR
21054, June 10, 1986; 53 FR 23978, June 24, 1988; 55 FR 41000, October 4, 1989; 56 FR 5602, February 11, 1991). 
Consistent with EPA's NPL/RCRA policy, EPA is adding two sites to the General Superfund Section of the NPL that may
be subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities, the Aqua-Tech Environmental Inc. (Groce Laboratories)
site in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and the Onondaga Lake site in Syracuse, New York. Aqua-Tech operated
a RCRA Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) under interim status until their RCRA Part B Permit application
was denied and they were forced to close. The loss of authorization to operate qualifies this site for NPL listing.
Onondaga Lake involves a RCRA subtitle C regulated facility which qualifies for NPL listing because of bankruptcy.



Releases From Federal Facility Sites 


On March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10520), the Agency announced a policy for placing Federal Facility sites on the NPL if they meet
the eligibility criteria (e.g., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater), even if the Federal Facility also is subject to the
corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. In that way, those sites could be cleaned up under CERCLA, if appropriate.



Economic Impacts 


The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at any site are not directly attributable to placement on the NPL. EPA
has conducted a preliminary analysis of economic implications of today's amendment to the NPL. EPA believes that
the kinds of economic effects associated with this revision generally are similar to those effects identified in
the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA
and the economic analysis prepared when amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985). The Agency
believes the anticipated economic effects related to adding sites to the NPL can be characterized in terms of the conclusions
of the earlier RIA and the most recent economic analysis. 
Inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itself impose any costs. It does not establish that EPA necessarily will undertake
remedial action, nor does it require any action by a private party or determine its liability for site response costs.
Costs that arise out of site responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actions to take, not directly
from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider the costs associated with responding to the sites
included in this rulemaking. 
The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPL are a search for potentially responsible parties
and a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at a
site. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative follow completion of the RI/FS, and operation
and maintenance (O&amp;M) activities may continue after construction has been completed. 
EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsible parties may bear some or all the
costs of the RI/FS, remedial design and construction, and O&amp;M, or EPA and the States may share costs.

The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by Section 104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites,
as well as at publicly-owned but not publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of the RI/FS and remedial
planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedial action. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial
action. For publicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all response costs at the site, including
the RI/FS and remedial design and construction of the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built, costs fall
into two categories:

 

_For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA will share in startup costs according to the criteria in the
previous paragraph for 10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achieved before the end of 10 years.

 

_For other cleanups, EPA will share for up to 1 year the cost of that portion of response needed to assure that a remedy
is operational and functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities for O&amp;M.




In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associated with these activities (RI/FS, remedial design,
remedial action, and O&amp;M) on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with this approach, using
the most recent (1993) cost estimates available; the estimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation
in costs for individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extent of contamination. Additionally, EPA is unable
to predict what portions of the total costs responsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs depends
on the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of any cost-recovery actions.

</TABLE>

 

Costs to the States associated with today's final rule arise from the required State cost-share of: (1) 10% of remedial
actions and 10% of first-year O&amp;M costs at privately-owned sites and sites that are publicly-owned but not publicly-operated;
and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning (RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action, and first-year O&amp;M
costs at publicly-operated sites. States will assume the cost for O&amp;M after EPA's period of participation. Using
the budget projections presented above, the cost to the States of undertaking Federal remedial planning and actions,
but excluding O&amp;M costs, would be approximately $42 million. State O&amp;M costs cannot be accurately determined
because EPA, as noted above, will share O&amp;M costs for up to 10 years for restoration of ground water and surface
water, and it is not known if the site will require this treatment and for how long. Assuming EPA involvement for 10 years
is needed, State O&amp;M costs would be approximately $69 million. 
Placing a hazardous waste site on the final NPL does not itself cause firms responsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless,
a listing may induce firms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potential trigger for subsequent enforcement
or cost-recovery actions. Such actions may impose costs on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionary
and made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of these effects cannot be made. EPA does not believe
that every site will be cleaned up by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firms or industry sectors
will bear specific portions of the response costs, but the Agency considers: The volume and nature of the waste at the
sites; the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties; the parties' ability to pay; and other
factors when deciding whether and how to proceed against the parties. 
Economy-wide effects of this amendment to the NPL are aggregations of efforts on firms and State and local governments.
Although effects could be felt by some individual firms and States, the total impact of this amendment on output, prices,
and employment is expected to be negligible at the national level, as was the case in the 1982 RIA. 


Benefits 


The real benefits associated with today's amendment are increased health and environmental protection as a result
of increased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for more Federally-financed remedial
actions, expansion of the NPL could accelerate privately-financed, voluntary cleanup efforts. Listing sites as
national priority targets also may give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. 
As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality
surface water, ground water, soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, although difficult to
estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at these sites. 


IV. Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impacts of this action on small entities, or certify
that the action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By small entities, the
Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations. 
While this rule revises the NCP, it is not a typical regulatory change since it does not automatically impose costs.
As stated above, adding sites to the NPL does not in itself require any action by any party, nor does it determine the
liability of any party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiable groups are affected as a whole.
As a consequence, impacts on any group are hard to predict. A site's inclusion on the NPL could increase the likelihood
of adverse impacts on responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs), but at this time EPA cannot identify the potentially
affected businesses or estimate the number of small businesses that might also be affected. 
The Agency does expect that the listing of the sites in this NPL rule could significantly affect certain industries,
or firms within industries, that have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problems. However,
EPA does not expect the listing of these sites to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
businesses. 
In any case, economic impacts would occur only through enforcement and cost-recovery actions, which EPA takes at
its discretion on a site-by-site basis. EPA considers many factors when determining enforcement actions, including
not only the firm's contribution to the problem, but also its ability to pay. The impacts (from cost recovery) on small
governments and nonprofit organizations would be determined on a similar case-by-case basis. 

For the foregoing reasons, I hereby certify that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, this regulation does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
