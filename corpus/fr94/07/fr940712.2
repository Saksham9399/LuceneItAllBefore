Rural Electrification Administration

Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.; Finding of No Significant Impact 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) has amended its finding of no significant
impact (FONSI) dated February 3, 1993, with respect to the potential environmental impact resulting from a proposal
by Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (AEPCO), to construct and operate a new ash and scrubber waste disposal
facility adjacent to its Apache Generating Station. 


</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Lawrence R. Wolfe, Chief, Environmental Compliance Branch, Electric Staff Division, room 1246, South Agriculture
Building, Rural Electrification Administration, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 720&hyph;1784. 


</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Apache Generating Station is located approximately 11 miles southeast of the Town of Willcox in Cochise County,
Arizona. The proposed project consists of constructing a 285-acre disposal facility that will include two ash pond
cells, an evaporation pond, and a scrubber sludge disposal pond. Due to site topography, the above ground height of
the disposal facility's exterior dikes will range from 5 feet along the western border to 30 feet along the eastern
border. The dike side slopes and pond bottoms will be lined with high density synthetic polyethylene flexible membrane
liners. Above ground pipelines will be used to sluice the ash and scrubber wastes from the plant to the disposal facility.
The facility is designed as a no discharge system. 



Alternatives considered to the proposed project included reconstruction of the existing ash and sludge ponds (no
action), total conversion of the Station to burn natural gas, sale of the ash and scrubber sludge, dry disposal of ash
and scrubber sludge, and construction of new disposal facilities at a different location. REA considered these alternatives
and concluded in a FONSI published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 12, 1993 that constructing new ash and scrubber waste disposal facilities at the AEPCO's proposed site
was the preferred alternative to ensure continued operation of the Apache Station's coal-fired units and compliance
with recent aquifer protection legislation. 

Subsequent to REA's previous action, an earth fissure was identified within the boundaries of AEPCO's preferred
site. This issue was considered significant enough for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to
require an onsite investigation. REA decided to reevaluate the proposed project based on the results of that investigation.
The amended FONSI is based on a review of the following information: (1) Combustion Waste Disposal Facility Fissure
Investigation; (2) Public Hearing Transcript on the draft Aquifer Protection Permit (APP); (3) Responsiveness
Summary prepared by the ADEQ in response to public comments on the draft APP; (4) Final APP issued on April 22, 1994;
and (5) other permits and approvals issued for the proposed facility and referenced in the FONSI. REA independently
evaluated the above listed documents and other available information and believes that modified design and additional
monitoring requirements included in the APP will ensure that future expansion or movement of the fissure and associated
seepage from the ponds is detected. These measures should preclude the potential for adverse impacts to groundwater
quality in the vicinity of the proposed facility. 

In accordance with REA Environmental Policies and Procedures for Electric and Telephone Borrowers, 7 CFR Part 1794,
AEPCO published notices in the 

San Pedro Valley News Sun

 and the 

Willcox Range News 

on May 5 and 12, 1994. The notices announced REA's decision to reassess its FONSI determination of February 12, 1993,
described the documentation upon which the reassessment would be based, and identified locations within Cochise
County at which these materials could be reviewed. The comments received did not identify any issues or concerns relating
to the project that: (1) had not been addressed by the appropriate regulatory authority; or (2) had not been previously
brought to REA's attention. 

A copy of the amended finding of no significant impact is available for review at, or can be obtained from, REA at the
address provided herein or from Mr. Mark W. Schwirtz, Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., 1000 South Highway
80, P.O. Box 670, Benson, Arizona 85602, during normal business hours.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:





NIST Docket No. 91&hyph;001
Title:

 Improved Oscillating Tube Densimeter


Description:

 The oscillating tube densimeter provides a unique measurement of fluid density. The invention consists of an electrically
conducting tube, through which the fluid is passed, surrounded by a magnet. A current passed through the tube thus
generates electromagnetic forces. These forces, in turn, generate a resonant frequency in the tube which can be accurately
determined through a measurement of the induced voltage. Since the resonant frequency is dependent on the density
of the fluid, it can thus be correlated to this induced voltage.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;008
Title:

 Sensing of Gas Metal Arc Welding Process Characteristics for Welding Process Control


Description:

 A method of monitoring and controlling the gas metal arc welding process. The weld electrical signals contain information
on the welding process characteristics. This invention monitors the welding process using a personal computer and
develops control responses from the information contained in these signals.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;036
Title:

 Oxygen-Containing Organic Compounds As Boundary Lubricants for Silicon Nitride Ceramics


Description:

 Several oxygen-containing compounds have been identified as having boundary lubricating capability with silicon
nitride ceramics. Effective lubrication can be obtained over a range of molecular weight and concentration, with
some compounds suitable at concentrations of as little as 1% in a paraffinic oil.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;038
Title:

 Optical Technique for Monitoring Electrochemical Interfaces


Description:

 This invention allows real time measurement of the progress of a chemical reaction at an electrochemical interface.
This is done by utilizing a coherent light source, without removing the solid interface from the sample and without
stopping the chemical reaction. The light sources used in the invention, which can include a helium neon laser or a
solid state laser, monitor the progress of a reaction by detecting changes in reactionary surface roughness and polarizability.
A wide range of chemical reactions may be measured, including, for example, metal finishing, electrochemical machining,
corrosion protection, metal deposition, electrochemical production, waste water treatment, or electrowining.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;050
Title:

 Compton Scattering Tomography


Description:

 New NIST technology generates tomographic images of solid objects that can only be examined from a single side. Based
on Compton scattering of gamma rays of X-rays, the NIST-generated images reveal different densities within a material.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;051
Title:

 Methods and Electrolytic Compositions for Electrodepositing Chromium Coatings


Description:

 A new NIST process deposits chromium plating up to 600 microns thick, without using or generating carcinogenic byproducts.
The plating process uses non-toxic trivalent chromium and the plating is three to four times harder, after heating,
than depositions using hexavalent chromium.


NIST Docket No. 92&hyph;052
Title:

 Contactless Magnetically Coupled Linewidth System


Description:

 Linewidth measurements are made on integrated circuit test structures via magnetic coupling, removing the need
for electrical contacts. A potential source of contamination is eliminated which reduces the possibility of circuit
damage during testing.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Northwest Expansion
II Projects </DOCTITLE>



July 6, 1994. 



On November 10, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent To Prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Expansion II Projects in the above dockets and related
projects proposed by Paiute Pipeline Company (Paiute) in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000
(Paiute Expansion II Projects). The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues. 

On June 14 and June 15, 1994 Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) filed amendments to its two original applications
that represent a change in the scope of the Northwest Expansion II Projects. Based on the changes in the amended filings,
we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an EIS is the more appropriate document for
analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with Northwest's projects. The cooperating Federal
agencies agree with this strategy. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis the important changes are:


&bull;The deletion of 8 pipeline loops from the projects, which reduces the total miles of pipeline construction
from 177.2 miles to 54.9 miles; 

&bull;The deletion of 11 compressor station modifications, which reduces the required compression from 88,235
horsepower (hp) to 14,820 hp; 

&bull;The addition of 5.8 miles of 20-inch-diameter loop in Marion County, Oregon (the Salem Loop) and 1,070 hp at
the existing Pegram Compressor Station in Bear Lake County, Idaho that were not part of the original proposals; 

&bull;The deletion of 26 of the 37 originally proposed meter station modifications; 

&bull;The change in pipeline routing of both the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral; and 

&bull;The termination of service agreements by all shippers that had proposed to have Northwest deliver gas to Paiute
for ultimate delivery to customers in Nevada. 

The list of facilities proposed in the amended filings are in appendix 1 and maps showing the location of the Salem Loop,
the Pegram Compressor Station, and the amended routing for the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral are attached
as appendix 2.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


1

</FOOTNAME>
The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the 

Federal Register

. Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington,
DC 20426 or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail.


</FOOTNOTE>


For the purposes of the environmental analysis Northwest's two applications will be considered together because
the construction of the Gresham Loop is common to both applications.

2

 The facilities proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 include the increase in compression at the Washougal
Compressor Station; the construction of the Gresham Loop, 1.3 miles of the Salem Loop (milepost 64.1 to 65.3), and
the Johnson Creek Meter Station; and the upgrading of six existing meter stations. The remaining facilities are part
of Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


2

</FOOTNAME>
The length and location of the Gresham Loop is the same in both applications; however, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001
Northwest proposes using 20-inch-diameter pipeline, while Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;00 proposes using 30-inch-diameter
pipeline. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The termination of all contracts that called for Northwest to deliver gas to Paiute effectively severs the connection
between Northwest's and Paiute's proposals; therefore, only Northwest's proposed facilities will be included
in the EA. 



The EA Process 



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity. Our EA will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concludes that the projects
would result in significant environmental impacts, we will prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise
we will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact. 

NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to
separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Local scoping meetings have
already been held for the original projects. Additional scoping meetings are not planned. We are asking for comments


only

 on those portions of the projects where the routing has been changed or the facilities were 

not

 part of the original proposal. 

The EA will discuss impacts that 

could

 occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings:


&bull;Geology and paleontology 

&bull;Endangered and threatened species 

&bull;Visual resources 

&bull;Water resources 

&bull;Vegetation 

&bull;Land use 

&bull;Air quality and noise 

&bull;Wetland and riparian habitat 

&bull;Cultural resources 

&bull;Fish and wildlife 

&bull;Socioeconomics 

&bull;Soils 

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the projects, or portions of the projects, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state,
and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries,
and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. 



Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal. You do not need to re-submit comments
if you have already done so. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: 

&bull;Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., NE., Washington, DC 20426.
 
&bull;Reference Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 and/or CP93&hyph;673&hyph;001; 

&bull;Send a 

copy

 of your letter to: Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Project Manager, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Room 7312, 
Washington, DC 20426; and 

&bull;Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington, DC, on or before August 11, 1994. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 3. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 



Environmental Mailing List 



If you don't want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information
Request (see appendix 4). If you have previously returned the Information Request you don't need to do so again. 

Additional information about the proposed projects is available from Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, EA Project Manager,
at (202) 208&hyph;0325.

<DOCTITLE>Provo River Project_Proposed Rate Methodology of Annual Charges</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Provo River Project Rate Methodology of Annual Charges.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Western Area Power Administration (Western) is proposing a methodology to determine annual charges to accompany
the independent marketing of Provo River Project (PRP) resources. A previous proposal to integrate this project
and its resources with Western's Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated Projects) was not supported
by customers. To date, PRP's resources have been sold to the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) at a rate to cover
project costs. Western proposes that capacity and energy produced by the PRP be marketed to those members of two Western
customers, Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah Municipal Power Agency (UMPA), located in
the area of the Provo River drainage, in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. Power will be allocated to these two customers
proportional to the electrical sales of their members who meet the criteria for receiving it. These customers will
pay all of the annual expenses of the PRP, including an amount to be used to assist the Provo River Water Users Association's
(Water Users) timely repayment of the original Federal investment in the PRP. In return, these customers will receive
all of the total marketable output of the PRP.


The proposed rate methodology constitutes a minor rate adjustment as defined by the procedures for public participation
in general rate adjustments covered in 10 CFR 903.2(f). The PRP annual sales are less than 100 million kilowatthours
and installed capacity is less than 20,000 kilowatts. A 30-day comment period will begin with the publication of this


Federal Register

 notice and end 30 days thereafter. After review of public comments, Western will recommend a proposed rate methodology
for establishing the annual charge to be approved on an interim basis by the Deputy Secretary of DOE. The proposed rate
methodology will be sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval on a final basis. The proposed rate
methodology for marketing capacity and energy is expected to become effective November 1, 1994, and it will remain
in effect until October 31, 1999, unless superseded by another rate action.
At present there is no existing PRP rate. Energy has been sold to the CRSP at an amount that meets the PRP's annual revenue
requirements for expenses and repayment obligations.
The following table shows the investment repayment status:

Background Information


Construction of the PRP was begun in May 1938, with the powerplant completed in 1958. It has a present generating capacity
of 5 megawatts of power. The Water Users, a corporation of stockholders owning prorated water entitlements, executed
contract No. Ilr&hyph;874 in 1936, with the Federal Government to construct and repay project facilities. Contract
No. Ilr&hyph;1082, dated December 20, 1938, established a contract among several entities to compensate the Utah
Power and Light Company with PRP power in exchange for power foregone at its powerplant. Only energy excess to project
purposes has been available for Federal marketing. Since 1963, CRSP has needed additional energy and has purchased
the available PRP energy at an amount established annually for the PRP to cover its costs, including operation, maintenance,
and replacement costs and repayment expenses. These expenses have included $1.623 million of irrigation assistance
to the Water Users. PRP's original power investment has been repaid.
In December 1993, Western proposed to change the way it marketed power and energy produced by PRP in response to customer
interest in its available resources. The part of the proposal that suggested inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated
Projects was not supported by customers for various reasons, thereby requiring Western to modify its original proposal
to one which will market PRP's power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Two Western customers, ICPA
and UMPA, pursued acquiring the available PRP capacity and energy. The members of these customers are located in the
PRP drainage area in Utah and Wasatch Counties. Western proposes that these customers receive all of the total marketable
output, with the power allocated proportionally to their eligible members' energy sales. ICPA and UMPA would pay
all of the annual expenses of the project. An amount to meet the repayment assistance to the Water Users would be recovered
under separate agreement.


Proposed Methodology


If Western adopts the proposal, Western will prepare a power repayment study (PRS) annually for PRP to establish the
revenue needed to meet annual costs, including operation, maintenance, and replacement repayment costs and interest.
Budgeted estimates of these future costs will be used in the PRS. The power assistance to the Water Users will not be
included in the PRS but will, instead, be paid under a separate arrangement among the Bureau of Reclamation, Western,
ICPA, UMPA, and the Water Users which will provide for equal annual installments of $102,285.71 over 14 years.

<TEXT>
 

If the proposed methodology is adopted and PRP energy is no longer sold to the CRSP, it will be necessary to collect the
PRP's share of transmission costs in Utah under contract No. 2436 with PacifiCorp. Assigning proportional shares
of Western's Tier 1 and Tier 2 costs will result in an annual transmission expense of approximately $30,348. This amount
also will be included as an annual expense of the PRP. The annual revenue requirement of the PRP, as determined by the
PRS, will then be prorated between ICPA and UMPA and divided by 12 for monthly billing to the customers. The rate methodology
used to determine the annual revenue requirement will be recalculated each year during the 5-year period that the
methodology is proposed to be in effect.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The PRP rate methodology is established pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 

et seq.

) and the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 U.S.C. &sect;388 

et seq., 

as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments, particularly &sect;9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of
1939, 43 U.S.C. &sect;485h(c).


By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, published November 10, 1993 (58 FR 58716), the Secretary
of Energy delegated (1) The authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates on a nonexclusive basis to
the Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, and place such rates into effect on an interim
basis to the Deputy Secretary; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, and place into effect on a final basis, to
remand, or to disapprove such rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Existing DOE procedures for public
participation in power rate adjustments (10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37835).


Availability of Information


All brochures, studies, comments, letters, memorandums, and other documents made or kept by Western for the purpose
of developing the proposed rate methodology for capacity and energy are and will be made available for inspection
and copying at the Salt Lake City Area Office located at 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah.


Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publish a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available
for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the proposed rule on small
entities. In this instance, the initiation of the PRP rate proposal is related to nonregulatory services provided
by Western at a particular rate. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), rules of particular applicability relating to rates or services
are not considered rules within the meaning of the act. Since the PRP capacity and energy rate methodology is of limited
applicability, no flexibility analysis is required.


Determination Under Executive Order 12866


DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive
Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866;
accordingly, no clearance of this notice by Office of Management and Budget is required.


Environmental Evaluation


In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

; Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part
1021), Western has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation of an environmental
assessment or an environmental impact statement.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. R&hyph;0841]</RINDOCK>


10 Percent Revenue Limit on Bank-Ineligible Activities of Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies Engaged in Underwriting
and Dealing in Securities


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1987 and 1989 the Board authorized bank holding companies to establish separate nonbank subsidiaries (``section
20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly (``ineligible
securities''). In order to ensure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), the Board
required that the amount of revenue a section 20 subsidiary derives from ineligible securities underwriting and
dealing activities may not exceed 10 percent of the total revenue of the subsidiary. Section 20 prohibits a member
bank of the Federal Reserve System from being affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting
and dealing in securities.


In January 1993, after notice and the opportunity for public comment, the Board authorized section 20 subsidiaries
to use an alternative indexed method to compute compliance with the 10 percent revenue limitation to account for unusual
changes in the level and structure of interest rates since 1989, when the 10 percent limit was adopted. When the Board
adopted the indexed revenue test, the Board deferred adoption of another alternative test for the 10 percent limit
that would be based on assets, rather than revenue. Inasmuch as the Board has had increased experience in reviewing
and monitoring the operations and activities of the section 20 subsidiaries, and in order to allow these subsidiaries
additional flexibility in the conduct of their securities operations, the Board now proposes to modify its orders
approving the establishment of the section 20 subsidiaries to allow such subsidiaries the option of using an alternative
measure to the revenue-based tests for assessing compliance with the 10 percent limit. The Board requests comment
on whether asset values, sales volume data, or both measures should be used as a new alternative to the revenue test.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received by August 12, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Comments, which should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0841, may be mailed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
1. Background


A. Ten Percent Limit on Ineligible Securities Activities of Section 20 Subsidiaries


Beginning with orders issued in 1987, the Board has authorized bank holding companies to establish nonbank subsidiaries
(``section 20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly
(``ineligible securities'').

1

 In order to assure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Board limited the amount of ineligible
securities that these section 20 subsidiaries could underwrite and deal in. Section 20 provides that a member bank
may not be affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting and dealing in securities.

2

 In particular, the Board determined that a bank affiliate would not be ``engaged principally'' in ineligible securities
activities for purposes of section 20 if those activities were not substantial relative to the other activities of
the subsidiary. The Board ruled that ineligible securities activities are not a substantial part of a subsidiary's
business if the gross revenue derived from those activities does not exceed 10 percent of the total gross revenues
of the subsidiary, when revenue is averaged over a rolling 8-quarter period. Subject to this limitation, the Board
has approved the establishment of over 30 section 20 subsidiaries, several of which are authorized to underwrite
and deal in debt and equity securities generally.

B. Adoption of Alternative Indexed Revenue Test


In July 1992, the Board proposed to establish two alternative methods that a section 20 subsidiary could elect to use
to determine compliance with the 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities in place of the gross revenue
test.

3

 In proposing these alternative tests, the Board noted that historically unusual changes in the level and structure
of interest rates have distorted the revenue test as a measure of the relative importance of ineligible securities
activities in a manner that was not anticipated when the 10 percent limit was adopted in 1989.

4

 To address this problem, the Board first proposed an alternative revenue test indexed to interest rate changes that
would allow for adjustment of the current revenue of a section 20 subsidiary to account for the unanticipated interest
rate conditions. In January 1993, the Board adopted an optional alternative indexed revenue test.

</FOOTNAME>
The Board pointed out that, in contrast to conditions in 1989, there was an unusually wide difference between short-
and long-term rates. Since eligible securities tend to be shorter term than ineligible securities, the unusually
sharp increase in the steepness of the yield curve had the effect of making it appear, based on revenue data, that the
eligible securities activities of at least some section 20 subsidiaries had been reduced, even though the relative
proportion of eligible and ineligible securities activities being conducted by those subsidiaries remained essentially
the same.

79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 226 (1993). Under the indexed revenue test, current interest and dividend revenues from
eligible and ineligible activities for each quarter are increased or decreased by an adjustment factor provided
by the Board based on the average duration of a section 20 subsidiary's eligible and ineligible securities portfolio.
The adjustment factors, which vary according to specific time periods of average duration, represent the ratio of
interest rates on Treasury securities in the most recent quarter to those in September 1989.

</FOOTNOTE>


C. Proposed Asset-Based Test


At the same time that the indexed revenue test was proposed, the Board also proposed an alternative asset-based test.
Specifically, the Board proposed that the 10 percent limit would be computed by using average daily assets held in
connection with ineligible securities activities and with other activities. The Board recognized that in 1987,
when it initially decided to use revenue as the appropriate measure of the section 20 limit on ineligible securities
activities, the Board had expressed two concerns about a test based on average assets. One concern was that an asset-based
test might be manipulated, for example, through ``matched book'' repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
for government securities. The second concern was that an average asset test, even if computed on a daily basis, would
not include securities that were underwritten by the section 20 subsidiary but that were held only for a few hours,
which is typical in many underwriting transactions. Accordingly, when the Board proposed an alternative asset-based
test in 1992, the Board requested comment on possible modifications to address these concerns.
A number of banking organizations commenting on the Board's proposal supported adoption of an asset-based alternative
measure for computing the 10 percent limit. These comments stated that, like the indexed revenue proposal, a limit
based on assets would be less susceptible than the unadjusted revenue test to unusual changes in interest rate conditions.
Those supporting the asset-based test also stated that this test would be easier and less costly to apply than a measure
that required adjustments to revenue data and would allow for greater predictability in the management of the operations
of the subsidiary.
Many commenters also opposed establishing any specific restrictions to address the potential for manipulative
transactions. These commenters believed that the capital and funding requirements needed to support such transactions,
as well as earnings considerations and market-imposed credit risk constraints, would effectively curtail the excessive
use of asset transactions conducted solely to increase the level of eligible assets. Commenters also observed that
implementation of such separate limits would be difficult in practice.
On the question of the treatment of intra-day holdings of securities that are being underwritten, while there was
some support for including the value of such securities for purposes of applying an asset-based test, other comments
opposed counting the value of such holdings on the grounds that the 10 percent limit should measure only assets that
pose a risk to the section 20 subsidiary.
After considering these comments, the Board decided to defer adoption of an alternative asset-based test, noting
that the Board was not then able to assess the potential practical effect of the test.


II. Proposed Alternative Test


A. Need for an Improved Alternative to the Gross Revenue Test


Since the decision to defer consideration of the asset-based test, the Board has had a greater opportunity to review
and analyze the operations of section 20 subsidiaries. At the outset, the Board notes that, during this time period
and in the entire seven year period since the Board first approved the creation of section 20 subsidiaries, the Board
has not uncovered evidence of unsafe or unsound practices, conflicts of interest, or other conduct related to the
operations of these subsidiaries that has impaired the condition of the affiliated depository institutions or the
banking organizations as a whole. The available evidence further suggests that these subsidiaries have exerted
a beneficial procompetitive influence on the securities markets in which they compete.
When the section 20 subsidiaries were first authorized, the Board selected revenue, rather than asset values or sales
volume, as the best overall measure of ineligible securities activities because the Board believed that such a test
would pose the fewest operational difficulties and provide the most accurate indication of the relative importance
of specific activities. The Board also noted that although the applicants had argued that a variety of factors could
be used to judge ``engaged principally'' status, a single uniform standard was desirable.

6




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>


Citicorp, supra, 

73 Federal Reserve Bulletin at 484.

</FOOTNOTE>


However, subsequent events have shown that the susceptibility of results from the gross revenue measure to distortion
caused by changes in interest rate conditions casts doubt on the appropriateness of that test. Although the indexed
revenue test addresses these concerns, it necessarily involves increased operational difficulties. For some section
20 subsidiaries, the costs and resources needed to implement the indexed revenue test, with the need for complicated
duration models and the calculation of the duration of all securities in a section 20 subsidiary's portfolio on a regular
basis, may provide a disincentive for using that test.

7




<FOOTNOTE>

At present only four section 20 subsidiaries are using the indexed revenue test.

<PARENT> FR940712-2-00037 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, and in order to provide additional flexibility to section 20 subsidiaries in the conduct of authorized
activities, the Board now believes it is desirable to consider adoption of another optional measure in addition to
revenue for applying 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities. The Board believes that either asset
values or sales volume, or a combination of both measures, should be considered as a new alternative measure.


B. Asset-Based Test as an Alternative Measure


Any asset-based test would limit a section 20 subsidiary's average daily assets held in connection with underwriting
and dealing in ineligible securities to 10 percent of its total average daily assets, computed on a rolling 8-quarter
basis. Because, as the Board observed when an asset-based test was previously proposed, a measure relying on asset
values would be less sensitive to unanticipated changes in interest rate conditions than a test based on revenues,
such a test would address these distortions. Also, it appears that for at least some section 20 subsidiaries a test
relying on asset values may be easier in practice to apply than the indexed revenue test. Moreover, as explained below,
in light of its greater experience with the operations of the section 20 subsidiaries, the Board is now of the view that
the concerns previously expressed about the operation of an asset-based test can be appropriately mitigated.
The Board believes that the use of assets acquired in connection with particular types of securities activities may
represent a permissible measure of compliance with the statutory limitation in section 20 on ineligible securities
activities. Asset values do provide a rough approximation of risk to the section 20 subsidiary, and risk to banking
organizations was one of the concerns behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Board notes that the New York State
Banking Department, in applying a state law restriction on the level of ineligible securities activities of affiliates
of state-chartered banks, allows the use of either assets or revenue as a measure of compliance with the law.

Underwriting


The Board believes that, if an asset-based test is adopted as an alternative measure, the value of any securities underwritten
by a subsidiary would have to be accounted for in computing average daily assets, even where the securities are disposed
of prior to the end of the day. The literal language of section 20 covers any underwriting activity. Thus, under the
proposed asset-based test, if securities underwritten by a section 20 subsidiary are recorded as assets of the subsidiary,
but are disposed of before the end of the day on which underwriting activity takes place, then the securities would
be treated as if they were carried as assets on the books of the subsidiary as of the end of that day. If securities are
underwritten by the section 20 subsidiary on a ``best efforts'' or agency basis the securities would be treated as
assets of the subsidiary for each day that underwriting activity occurs with respect to that particular security.

9




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Under an asset-based alternative measure, similar treatment would be accorded an entire issue of privately-placed
securities when any portion of the issue is taken into inventory pursuant to SEC Rule 144A.

</FOOTNOTE>


Anti-Manipulation Limits


Should an asset-based test be adopted as an alternative measure, the Board does not propose that any specific limits
be incorporated to address the potential for manipulative transactions carried out solely to inflate artificially
a section 20 subsidiary's base of eligible assets. Many of the comments on the previously proposed asset-based test
stated that there are sufficient financial and market constraints on the holding of excessive eligible securities
solely to support increased ineligible securities activities. Even in the case of matched book-type transactions,
counterparties typically impose limits on the amount of transactions they will engage in with any particular section
20 subsidiary, in order to control credit risk. The Board's minimum consolidated leverage ratio and the SEC's net
capital rule, which is applicable to a section 20 subsidiary, would impose additional constraints. In addition,
the acquisition of significant amounts of eligible securities by a section 20 subsidiary in matched book or similar
transactions would also tend to have an overall negative impact on the earnings performance of the consolidated bank
holding company organization, given the small profit margins typical in such transactions. Finally, the Board believes
that it has the authority to take appropriate corrective action where manipulative transactions are detected.


C. Sales Volume Test as Alternative Measure


The Board is also requesting comment on adoption of sales volume as an alternative measure. If sales volume data is
used as the measure of an alternative test for applying the 10 percent limit, then the dollar volume of a section 20 subsidiary's
sales of ineligible securities as a result of underwriting and dealing in such securities could not be allowed to exceed
10 percent of its total sales volume over a rolling 8-quarter period.
The Board believes that the value of various types of securities and other assets sold by a section 20 subsidiary bears
a relationship to the subsidiary's level of activity with respect to each type of security or other asset. Use of such
data is thus consistent with the statutory requirements. Under a sales volume test, intra-day transactions like
underwriting and dealing sales would be automatically covered, even if the assets involved were not recorded on the
subsidiary's books at the end of the day. In addition, like an asset-based test, a sales volume test would be less sensitive
to changes in interest rate relationships. Such a test may also be easier to comply with than the current alternative
of indexed revenues.

Repurchase Transactions and Other Sales Transactions


One question raised by the use of sales volume as a test of the 10 percent limit is whether securities repurchase agreements
(``repo transactions'') should be treated as ``sales'' and therefore covered under such a test. Repo transactions
are hybrids, having some characteristics of collateralized lending and some characteristics of an outright sale
of securities. The Federal Reserve, for purposes of open market operations, has taken the position that repo transactions
are sales rather than loans. The Board requests comment on how repo transactions should be treated for purposes of
a sales volume test, if such a test were adopted as an appropriate alternative measure.
In addition, the Board invites comments concerning reporting and other administrative issues associated with implementing
a sales volume test. The Board specifically requests comment on how sales volume should be computed for various types
of transactions involving the same kinds of underlying securities in different market places. For example, Treasury
bonds may be sold in the cash market, on a ``When Issued'' basis, on a forward contract basis, or indirectly, by purchasing
a put option or selling a futures contract. Although each type of transaction may be reported differently for balance
sheet purposes, all of the various kinds of transactions may have an identical impact on the section 20 subsidiary's
risk profile.
The Board is considering adopting instructions similar to those contained in the current Federal Reserve Report
Series Form FR 2004, Schedule B ``Weekly Report of Cumulative Dealer Transactions'' for collection of sales volume
information. Accordingly, comments are requested concerning whether the instructions and definitions for reporting
sales volume data in the FR 2004 would provide an adequate basis for developing sales volume reporting for section
20 subsidiaries. Comments are also requested concerning the definition and reporting of various types of transactions
that are not addressed in the existing FR 2004 report instructions.


Manipulative Transactions


When the Board first approved the establishment of the section 20 subsidiaries, it considered and rejected using
a sales volume test, on the ground that the eligible securities sales volume of a section 20 subsidiary, like asset
values, could be easily inflated by repeated matched book transactions intended for no other purpose than to inflate
the subsidiary's eligible sales volume base.

10

 As noted above, many of the comments on the previously proposed asset-based test pointed out the credit risk and market
limitations on the extent to which a section 20 subsidiary may engage in matched book or similar transactions. While
these limits may be less effective where a section 20 subsidiary engages in unusual sales of securities with its own
affiliate, rather than with a third party, solely for the purpose of increasing the volume of eligible securities
sales, these matters can be addressed during the examination process and, as noted above, corrective action can be
taken where manipulative transactions are found.

73 Federal Reserve Bulletin at 484.

</FOOTNOTE>


D. Compliance With Both Measures


A possible means for addressing the disadvantages of asset values and sales volume alone as appropriate measures
is to require a section 20 subsidiary electing an alternative test to comply with both measures. The Board seeks comment
on this possible requirement.


E. Implementation of Any Alternative Test


The Board notes that comments received on the asset-based test previously proposed suggested that, if such a test
were adopted, some section 20 subsidiaries may not have access to sufficiently detailed asset data for earlier quarters
to allow computation of such a test on a rolling 8-quarter basis and may not be able to obtain this information easily.
Therefore, the Board proposes that, if an alternative measure is adopted using either asset values or sales volume,
or a combination of both measures, a section 20 subsidiary would be allowed, at its election, initially to comply with
such a test on a prospective basis only for the first two-year period. The Board followed this approach when the indexed
revenue test was adopted.
As was also the case with respect to adoption of the indexed revenue test, the Board proposes that, regardless of which
test may be adopted as an alternative measure, any section 20 subsidiary electing to use a new test would be required
to continue using that test for a period of at least two years, in order to prevent frequent switching between tests
that would impair an accurate assessment of the relative importance of the subsidiary's ineligible securities activities.


F. Proposed Elimination of Indexed Revenue Test


The Board also seeks comment as to why, if a new alternative measure is adopted, the indexed revenue test should not
be eliminated because there would no longer be a need for that alternative measure. However, a section 20 subsidiary
would be allowed to continue to elect to use the unadjusted revenue test, if the subsidiary wishes to avoid the costs
associated with converting to any new test.


G. Proposed Modification of Board Orders


The Board proposes that its orders approving the establishment of section 20 subsidiaries be modified to provide
that a section 20 subsidiary may elect, as an alternative to the existing revenue tests, to apply an asset-based test
to assess compliance with the 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities. Under such a test, a section 20
subsidiary would be viewed as in compliance with that section for any quarter if the average daily assets held in connection
with underwriting and dealing in ineligible securities for that quarter, when added to the average daily assets held
in connection with ineligible securities activities for the previous seven quarters, does not exceed 10 percent
of the average daily total assets of the subsidiary for that quarter and for the seven previous quarters.

11




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


11

</FOOTNAME>
Securities underwritten by the subsidiary, including securities taken into inventory in a private placement pursuant
to SEC Rule 144A, would be treated as assets of the subsidiary for each day underwriting activity takes place with respect
to such securities.

</FOOTNOTE>


In the alternative, the Board proposes that section 20 subsidiaries be authorized to elect to apply, as an alternative
to the existing revenue test, a sales volume test to assess compliance with the 10 percent limit. Under such a test,
a section 20 subsidiary would be viewed as in compliance with that section for any quarter if the total dollar volume
of sales of ineligible securities from underwriting and dealing activities for that quarter, when added to the total
dollar volume of such sales for the previous seven quarters, does not exceed 10 percent of the total dollar volume of
sales of all securities and other assets by the subsidiary for that quarter and for the seven previous quarters.
Finally, as a third alternative, the Board proposes that section 20 subsidiaries be authorized to apply an alternative
test measured by both asset values and sales volume. Under such a test, a section 20 subsidiary would be viewed as in
compliance with section 20 for any quarter if the subsidiary simultaneously satisfied both the asset-based and sales
volume measures described above.

<RINDOCK>[Announcement 447] </RINDOCK>


Evaluation of the Impact of the 1993 AIDS Case Definition 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a competitive cooperative agreement program to study the quality of AIDS surveillance using the 1993 AIDS case definition
and reporting system to determine methods that increase the efficiency of AIDS surveillance activities. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV Infection. (To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,''
see the section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) 





Authority:

 These cooperative agreements are authorized under Sections 301(a) and 311 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C.
241(a) and 243], as amended. Applicable program regulations are found in 42 CFR Part 52, Grants for Research Projects.



Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Assistance will be provided only to official public health agencies of States and their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic
of Palau, and the following cities and county only: the cities of Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco,
and the County of Los Angeles. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $1,200,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund four to six awards. It is expected that the average award will
be $250,000, ranging from $200,000 to $300,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about September 30,
1994, and will be for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and
are subject to change. Continuation awards within a project period will be based on satisfactory progress and the
availability of funds. 


Purpose 


The purpose of these awards is to assist State and local health departments in: (1) Determining the sensitivity, timeliness,
and validity of the AIDS surveillance system; (2) Improving the efficiency of AIDS surveillance by evaluating a variety
of case ascertainment methods; and (3) Identifying the information collected as part of AIDS surveillance that is
most useful for planning and evaluating HIV-related treatment and preventive services. 
All activities should be implemented under various reporting alternatives (provider-based vs. lab-initiated
reporting) through a population-based retrospective study. 


Program Requirements 


In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for activities
under A., below, and CDC will be responsible for conducting activities under B., below:

A. Recipient Activities 


1. Conduct a retrospective evaluation of medical and laboratory records to obtain histories of CD4+ and HIV testing,
the occurrence of opportunistic infections (OIs) among persons reported to AIDS surveillance, and the number and
type of sites that provide care for HIV-infected persons to determine the sensitivity, validity, and timeliness
of AIDS surveillance and the ability to effectively monitor the epidemic using the 1993 AIDS surveillance definition
and reporting system. As needed, conduct personal interviews with all, or a sample of, persons who are reported with
AIDS to retrospectively collect data on dates and results of all prior CD4+ and HIV tests, OIs, receipt of treatment
and prophylaxis, and degree of access to the health care system. If the cases being investigated received treatment
in multiple health facilities, as many records as possible should be pursued. 
2. Propose alternative surveillance methods to increase the cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of case-finding.
For example, areas with provider-based surveillance can pilot a laboratory-initiated reporting system and compare
this activity to existing surveillance methods. For areas with both provider and laboratory-initiated case-finding
methods, evaluative methods may include comparing data from these sources to alternative data bases. The alternative
data bases used for evaluation should not currently be linked to case-finding activities, and may vary by State (e.g.,
death certificates are used for case-finding in most areas, and are therefore not useful for evaluation activities).
Other methods to increase efficiency may be explored in comparison to existing case-finding methods, including:
sampling for risk information; reporting only from laboratory and alternative data bases, such as death registries;
and conducting active surveillance for preventable opportunistic infections only. 
3. Collect data in the treatment and services referral section of the adult HIV/AIDS confidential case report form
on all or a representative sample of persons reported to AIDS surveillance, describe the data sources, the collection
methods, and determine resources needed to obtain these data. Develop measures to assess the usefulness of these
data for the planning of prevention activities by the local health department and community planning bodies. 
4. Participate in meetings to plan and develop standardized evaluation protocols and to discuss progress and methodologic
issues. If travel is needed it will be supported through specific funds awarded in this cooperative agreement. 
5. Ensure confidentiality of information collected from persons with AIDS and persons with confirmed or suspected
HIV infection. 
6. Maintain responsibility for analysis and presentation of data collected for local purposes. 
7. Demonstrate coordination with existing HIV/AIDS surveillance activities. 
8. Identify and select appropriate staff. 


B. CDC Activities 


1. Provide oversight and technical assistance as the project progresses. 
2. Assist the participant in planning and implementing the evaluation, including providing technical guidance
in the development of data collection instruments, outcome measures, reporting protocols, training, and pretesting
methods. Coordinate activities among project participants to promote information sharing and ensure comparability
of data collection. 
3. Compile, analyze, and report results of aggregate data in collaboration with participating sites.

<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Agreement To Establish a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Initiative Program for African-Americans</DOCTITLE>


Introduction


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement program to develop a health promotion and disease prevention initiative to reduce preventable
death, sickness, and disability; to reduce disparities in health; and to enhance the quality of life among African-Americans.
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to all the priority areas of Healthy People 2000 as well as the 1985 Secretary's
Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000'' or the ``Report of the
Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health,'' see the section 

Where to Obtain Additional Information

.)


Authority


This program is authorized under Sections 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) and 317(k)(2) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)) of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended, and the President's Executive Order 12876 of 1993.


Smoke-Free Workplace


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are National Minority Organizations (NMOs) and/or Regional Minority Organizations (RMOs)
which principally serve African-American populations. The African-American population is very diverse and more
targeted strategies and activities are needed to reduce the growing health gap among this group. Consistent with
the 1985 Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health, excess mortality, morbidity and disability
continues to disproportionately affect African-Americans. A more current update of that report documents continuing
excess deaths specifically for African-Americans. Eligible applicants must submit documentation to demonstrate
that they comply with the following:
1. Are an established tax-exempt organization (a nongovernmental, tax-exempt corporation or association whose
net earnings in no part lawfully accrue to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals). The following is acceptable
evidence of tax-exempt status: (i) A reference to the applicant's organization in the Internal Revenue Service's
(IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code; or (ii) a copy of
a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate.
2. Have a governing body or board that is composed of more than 50% racial or ethnic minority group members who are representative
of the population to be served.
3. Have a minimum of 12 months documented experience in operating and centrally administering a coordinated public
health or related program serving racial or ethnic minority populations within a major portion or region (multistate
or multiterritory) of the United States through its own offices, organizational affiliates, or the participation
of other minority organizations.
4. Have a specific charge from the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or a resolution from its governing body or board
to operate nationally or regionally (multistate or multiterritory) within the United States and its Territories.

5. Organizations participating in the program must have agreements with their affiliates, chapters, or other minority
organizations that each organization must have a governing body or board whose membership is composed of more than
50% racial or ethnic minority group members who are representative of the population to be served. 


Availability of Funds 


A minimum of $100,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund one award. Additional funds are expected. It is expected that the
award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years.
Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on
the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 


Purpose 


The principal purpose of the cooperative agreement is to assist an NMO or RMO to establish the following three components:
a Health Program Unit, a Speakers Bureau, and a National Health Network. This will allow the awardee to use these components
for the following: 


Health Program Unit:

 The awardee will implement preventive strategies to improve the health of African-Americans by targeting the seven
leading causes of excess deaths in this population. The Health Program Unit will also develop and implement strategies
to improve the utilization of community health resources by African-Americans. 


Speakers Bureau:

 The awardee will organize a National Speakers Bureau of health professionals and other professionals to provide
oral presentations on salient health promotion and disease prevention topics relating to African-Americans at
national, State, and local meetings. Other organizations will have ready access to the Speakers Bureau to assist
in improving disease prevention and health promotion activities in their areas. 


National Health Network:

 The awardee will assist minority organizations to: (1) Expand their internal and external organizational networks,
and (2) facilitate the dissemination of health promotion and disease prevention information to African-Americans.
This network will use the communication systems that already exist in the community to assist in reaching the target
audience. 


Program Requirements 


In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities under B. (CDC Activities). 

 


A. Recipient Activities 


1. The Health Program Unit 


a. Communicate science-based health promotion and disease prevention strategies developed with CDC throughout
African-American communities to improve the environment and personal health behaviors of those living in these
communities. 
b. Assess ongoing health related activities in various communities to determine if African-Americans are involved,
and to determine if the activities are appropriate for the target audience (i.e., immunization, STD/HIV prevention).

c. Focus on the seven leading causes of deaths in African-American populations, and help design health promotion
and disease prevention materials relevant to the populations served. 
d. Improve the utilization of the community health resources by African-Americans. 
e. Develop and disseminate audio-visual and written health promotion material for the target population. 
f. Develop quality of life measures for community members through a consensus building process (e.g., oral health,
mental health). Inform the target group about health promotion and disease prevention activities related to the
seven leading causes of deaths among African-Americans that were found in the community.

<DOCTITLE>Savannah River Site Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project; Public Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces
the following meeting.





Name:

 Savannah River Site Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project.


Time and Date:

 5:30 p.m.&hyph;9:30 p.m., July 27, 1994.


Place:

 Savannah Public Library, 2002 Bull Street, Savannah, Georgia 31499.


Status:

 Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available.


Purpose:

 Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations
of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation
or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.



In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public
health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and
public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites
that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies,
health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research,
emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles.
Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental
dose reconstruction for DOE's Savannah River Site near Augusta, Georgia, as well as a worker study at the same site,
the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of South Carolina and Georgia citizens to
provide consensus advice to CDC and ATSDR regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking
steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research
at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
The draft charter for this proposed committee states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each
DOE site, operational guidelines at each site must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and
the responsibilities of the committee members and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public
meetings to begin developing operational guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of this meeting will be to
update the public on the status of CDC's and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and
recommendations from interested parties concerning selection criteria and operating procedures.
Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.



CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 20, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received a Notice of Staking (NOS) for a proposed well in the
Blackleaf Unit. The proposed well is located in northwestern Teton County about 25 miles northwest of Choteau, Montana.
The NOS is the first step in the process and allows an operator to survey a location and access route to a proposed well.
An Application for Permit to Drill (APD) including the subsurface plan (which details the drilling program) and the
surface use plan (which describes any surface disturbances) will be submitted to BLM following an onsite inspection.
Upon receipt of the APD, the BLM will analyze the proposal.


</SUMMARY>

<RINDOCK>[Finance Docket No. 32531] </RINDOCK>



Patrick D. Broe, The Broe Companies, The Great Western Railway Company, Railco Inc., Chicago West Pullman Transportation
Corp., et al._Corporate Family Reorganization Exemption 



On June 9, 1994, Patrick D. Broe (Mr. Broe), The Broe Companies, Inc. (BCI), The Great Western Railway Company (GWR),
Railco Inc. (Railco), Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corp. (CWPT), OmniTRAX, Inc. (OmniTRAX), and their carrier
subsidiaries jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3) to reorganize the carrier subsidiaries
and for OmniTRAX, a noncarrier holding company, to control the carrier subsidiaries. 

Mr. Broe is a noncarrier individual who directly controls Panhandle Northern Railroad Company (PNR) and Central
Kansas Railway Limited Liability Company (CKR) and who also owns and controls BCI and OmniTRAX. BCI is a noncarrier
holding company that directly controls the noncarriers GWR and Railco. GWR directly controls the carriers Great
Western Railway of Colorado, Inc. (GWRC), Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc. (GWRI), and Great Western Railway
of Oregon, Inc. (GWRO). Railco controls the noncarrier CWPT, which in turn controls six class III railroads: the Chicago,
West Pullman &amp; Southern Railroad Company (CWP&amp;S); the Georgia Woodlands Railroad Company (GWRR); The Newburgh
&amp; South Shore Railroad Company (NSR); Chicago Rail Link (CRL); Manufacturers' Junction Railway Company (MJR);
and Kansas Southwestern Railway Company (KSW). 

Under the reorganization, MJR, CWP&amp;S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR and GWRC will be reformed as limited liability
companies. GWRO will remain a corporation. NSR will be reformed as a limited liability partnership. BCI will convey
its interest in GWR, Railco and CWPT to OmniTRAX and the GWR, Railco and CWPT holding companies will be dissolved. Mr.
Broe will transfer his direct controlling interests in PNR and CKR to OmniTRAX. As a result of these transactions,
OmniTRAX will control all 11 rail carriers (MJR, CWP&amp;S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR, GWRC, NSR, CKR and GWRO). Mr
Broe will continue to control OmniTRAX. 

The parties intend to consummate the transactions on or after June 15, 1994. 

These transactions are within a corporate family of the type specifically exempted from prior review and approval
under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). The parties say that the transactions will not result in adverse changes in service levels,
significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family.
The stated purpose of the reorganization is to obtain better tax treatment, to facilitate estate planning, and to
simplify the corporate structure, which should allow a more efficient operation. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transactions will be protected by
the conditions set forth in 

New York Dock Ry.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;9]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>Steven E. Warren, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>




On October 5, 1992, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause
to Steven E. Warren, M.D. (Respondent), of Salt Lake City, Utah, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration,
AW1662609, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21
U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), in that the Respondent was personally abusing narcotic controlled substances and obscured
this use from others; that Respondent misused his registration privilege to obtain Schedule II controlled substances
for other than legitimate medical purposes; that Respondent failed to maintain complete and accurate controlled
substance records; that Respondent failed to account for 40 to 50 multi-dose vials of Demerol; that Respondent added
saline solution to a commercial vial of Demerol in an effort to mislead investigators; and that Respondent distributed
controlled substance samples without a legitimate medical purpose.


Additionally, citing his preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration posed an imminent danger
to the public health and safety, the Administrator ordered the immediate suspension of DEA Certificate of Registration,
AW1662609, during the pendency of these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d).


The Respondent, by counsel, responded to the Order to Show Cause and requested a hearing. The matter was docketed before
Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. A hearing was held in Salt Lake City, Utah on July 28, 1993.


On October 6, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling in which he recommended, 

iner alia,

 that the Respondent's DEA registration be revoked and that any pending applications be denied. The administrative
law judge also recommended that the Administrator grant the Respondent alternative relief in the form of a waiver
of DEA regulations to permit the San Juan County Hospital to employ Respondent and permit him to order controlled substances
for hospital patients. The Government filed exceptions to this recommendation, and the Respondent filed a response
to the Government's exceptions. The administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator
on November 8, 1993. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
enters his final order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The administrative law judge found that the Respondent graduated from medical school with the assistance of a National
Service Corps scholarship, and was subsequently assigned to a remote county in Utah to complete his four year obligation
to the Federal Government. After completion of his obligation, Respondent continued to practice in the area. For
a period of approximately two years, Respondent was the only physician in the county.


In 1991 and 1992, Utah State licensing authorities initiated an investigation into the Respondent's prescribing
practices by conducting audits of two local pharmacies. No violations were found. However, in June 1992, after anonymous
complaints that the Respondent was receiving injections during his medical practice, the state initiated a new investigation
and determined that the Respondent was unable to account for quantities of Demerol, a Schedule II narcotic controlled
substance. Additionally, investigators determined that improper transfers of Demerol from the local hospital
to the Respondent's medical office had been made.

At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he had started self-administering Demerol for shoulder
pain and migraine headaches after a fall off the roof of his home. Subsequently, the Respondent was exposed to a contaminated
needle in the course of his practice, became ill, and was admitted to a hospital for several days. There, he discussed
his addiction with physicians, who arranged his admission to a five-week rehabilitative program. The Respondent
surrendered his state controlled substance license in October 1992.

<TEXT>
 

The administrative law judge found that the Respondent used Demerol, without a legitimate medical purpose, and became
addicted during the summer of 1992. To obscure his use of the drug from hospital and clinic personnel, the Respondent
used Demerol from the hospital inventory, wrote false prescriptions, and, at least once, injected saline solution
into a Demerol vial. Additionally, the Respondent failed to keep complete and accurate records of his acquisition,
disposition, and inventory of controlled substances. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent's
demanding work schedule, his spouse's health problems, and a shoulder injury predisposed the Respondent to Demerol
addiction.
The Respondent was charged, under Utah State law, with possessing and distributing a counterfeit substance, possession
of a controlled substance without a valid prescription, possession of a false prescription and failure to make a record
for prescribing and administering controlled substances. On May 3, 1993, before the Seventh Judicial District Court
for San Juan County, Utah, the Respondent pled guilty to five felony counts. The Respondent's sentence included a
fine, imprisonment not to exceed five years, and a one-year suspension of his medical license. The Court's Judgment
and Order stayed the sentence for a period of five years and the Respondent was placed on probation with conditions,
which included a two year prohibition from reapplying for a state controlled substance license. On May 5, 1993, the
State of Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issued a Stipulation and Order with terms similar
to that of the Judgment and Order, including a provision that the Respondent complete a rehabilitation program.
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent participated in an aftercare recovery program, attending
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; agreed to random drug screening all of which were negative; and was complying with
or working on the conditions imposed in his probation agreement and in his licensing board stipulations. The administrative
law judge concluded that the Respondent had made substantial efforts at rehabilitation, is presently in recovery,
and that his prognosis for a full recovery is good.
Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration may revoke the registration
of a practitioner ``*&blank;*&blank;*upon a finding that the registrant_
(1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of
this chapter;
(2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United
States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance;
(3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no
longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances
or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his registration recommended by competent State authority;
(4) has committed such acts as would render his registration under Section 823 of this title inconsistent with the
public interest as determined under such section; or
(5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to section 1320a&hyph;7(a)
of Title 42.''
The administrative law judge determined that subsections (2), (3), and (4) provide a basis for revocation based on
Respondent's conviction of five felony counts relating to controlled substances, his surrender of his state controlled
substance license, and the public interest factors.
Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following
factors shall be considered:
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940712-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940712-2-00053 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 54 FR 16422 (1989).
The administrative law judge found that all of the factors listed in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) are relevant. Respondent surrendered
his state controlled substance license and the State of Utah has recommended that he not apply for reinstatement for
a period of time. Respondent admitted to wrongfully obtaining Demerol for his own use, and he pled guilty to five felony
counts relating to controlled substances. As to factor (5), the administrative law judge found that the public health
and safety are not at risk, since the Respondent has made progress in his rehabilitation and both the criminal plea
agreement and medical board agreement require that the Respondent comply with numerous conditions to ensure that
he will not suffer a relapse in his recovery.
The DEA has consistently held that it does not have statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to register
a practitioner unless that practitioner is authorized by the state to dispense controlled substances. DEA has consistently
held that termination of a registrant's state authority to handle controlled substances requires that DEA revoke
the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration. 

Bobby Watts, M.D.,

 53 FR 11919 (1987). Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the Respondent's registration
must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a) (2), (3) and (4).
As an additional issue, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent presented evidence that the local
community has suffered by the lack of Respondent's ability to practice in the hospital emergency room. The Respondent
and the San Juan County Hospital entered into a protocol in which the Respondent would be able to write hospital patient
prescriptions for controlled substances under the hospital's DEA number. This agreement is contingent on the successful
application to the Deputy Administrator of the DEA by the hospital for a waiver of the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.76(a),
which precludes the hospital from employing an individual with access to controlled substances if that individual
has been convicted of a controlled substance related felony. The San Juan County Hospital requested that the Deputy
Administrator grant a waiver to allow the employment of the Respondent. The administrative law judge recommended
that such a waiver be granted by the Deputy Administrator pursuant to his authority under 21 CFR 1307.03.
The Government filed an exception to the recommendation of the administrative law judge that a waiver of 21 CFR 1301.76(a)
be granted contending that since the Respondent has no underlying state controlled substance license nor a DEA registration,
he should not be permitted to handle controlled substances under any circumstance. The Respondent, in response to
the Government exception, presented a letter from the Utah Attorney General's office permitting the Respondent,
with the appropriate DEA exemption, to order controlled substances for hospital patients, until such time as the
Utah State Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing arrived at a formal opinion on this issue.
The Deputy Administrator disagrees with the administrative law judge's recommendation with regard to a waiver or
exemption from regulations and agrees with the Government's contention that such a waiver should not be granted.
In fact, on December 7, 1993, DEA previously denied the request of San Juan Hospital that it be granted an exemption
from the regulations to allow the Respondent's employment with access to controlled substances.
The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of Administrative
Law Judge Tenney, except as otherwise noted herein. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR
23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AW1662609, previously issued to Steven E. Warren, M.D.,
be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied.
This order is effective July 12, 1994.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;277]</RINDOCK>


In the Matter of: Philadelphia Electric Co. (Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2)


Exemption


I


Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;44, which
authorizes operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2. The license provides, among other
things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the
Commission) now and hereafter in effect.
The PBAPS, Unit 2 facility consists of a boiling water reactor located in York County, Pennsylvania.


II


In its letter dated April 18, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the Commission's regulations. The subject
exemption is from a requirement in Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 that Type B and C containment penetration leak rate tests
be performed at intervals no greater than 2 years. The exemption would allow a one-time 60-day extension of the 2-year
requirement. Hence, this one-time exemption would allow the licensee to perform the testing in Sections III.D.2.(a)
and III.D.3 during Unit 2's Cycle 10 refueling outage scheduled to begin no later than September 24, 1994.
The licensee is utilizing a new core design at PBAPS, Unit 2, which allows the intervals between reactor shutdowns
for refueling to extend beyond the maximum allowable 2-year interval. Accordingly, the licensee is unable to comply
with the testing intervals specified in Appendix J of 10 CFR Part 50. Prior to the current operating cycle, local leak
rate tests were performed in conjunction with an operating cycle of 18 months. The 18-month operating cycle was more
conducive to the 2-year testing interval.
Use of extended cycle core designs has been recognized as a growing trend in the industry as discussed in the staff's
Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month
Fuel Cycle,'' dated April 2, 1991. The staff previously granted the licensee two license amendments to allow PBAPS,
Unit 2 to perform selected surveillances on a 24-month interval (see Amendment 169 dated August 19, 1992, and Amendment
179 dated August 2, 1993). However, the regulations cited by the licensee in the exemption request have not yet been
revised to reflect the use of a 24-month operating cycle by some licensees. Therefore, the licensee has requested
an exemption in order to avoid a premature shutdown, which would be needed to accomplish the testing, and also to properly
schedule the testing during the refueling outage.


III


Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. *&blank;*&blank;*''
The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type B and Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not
to exceed 2 years, is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified
within a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow
the tests to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. This interval was originally published in Appendix
J when refueling cycles were conducted at approximately annual intervals and has not been changed to reflect 18-month
or 2-year operating cycles. It is not the intent of the regulation to require a plant shutdown solely for the purpose
of conducting the periodic leak rate tests.
Based on the information presented in the licensee's application, the proposed extended test interval would not
result in a non-detectable leakage rate in excess of the value established by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, or in any changes
to the containment structure or plant systems. Therefore, the containment integrity would be maintained. As a result,
the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of the rule.
On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). Since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous
leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of no more than 60 days beyond the 2-year permitted
interval will not have a significant safety impact. Therefore, the staff also finds that extending the interval between
tests will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.


IV


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, an exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and that there are special circumstances present,
as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3
are not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation; and hereby grants the following exemption
with respect to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3.
For the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2, the testing intervals specified in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections
III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 are extended to allow the testing to be performed during the Unit 2 cycle 10 refueling outage.
This one-time extension is granted for a maximum of 60 days from the 2 year interval required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 33312).
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is providing notice of adjusted present value factors applicable to employees

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 831.2205(a) of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes the method for computing the reduction in
the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree who elects an alternative form of annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8343a. That
reduction is required in order to produce an annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the annuity of a retiree who
does not elect an alternative form of annuity. The present value factors currently used to compute the reduction were
published by OPM (56 FR 7424) on February 22, 1991.


On September 20, 1993, OPM published (58 FR 49066) a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to revise the normal cost percentage under the FERS Act of 1988, Pub. L. 99&hyph;335, based on changed economic assumptions
approved by the Board of Actuaries. Those changed economic assumptions require corresponding changes in the present
value factors used to compute an alternative form of annuity. The changed factors will also be used, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 8334(d)(2), to compute the annuity of an employee whose annuity commences on or after October 1, 1994,
and who retires while owing a redeposit of a refund for service that ended before October 1, 1990. OPM is, therefore,
revising the table of present value factors to read as follows:

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago
Stock Exchange, Inc. To Waive Exchange Transaction Fees on Trades in the Chicago Stock Basket



July 5, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 30, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CHX proposes to waive, through September 30, 1994, Exchange transaction fees for trades in the Chicago Stock Basket

September 30, 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organizations's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed change is to extend the waiver of certain Exchange fees for trades in the CXM through September
30, 1994.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among members using its facilities.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance on the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating

I. Introduction



On March 8, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities

<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 on the CBOE's Real Estate Investment Trust (``REIT'') Index (``REIT Index'' or ``Index''), and LEAPS on a reduced-value
REIT Index. On June 14, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.

In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE: (1) advised that surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of

Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') every 15 seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component
stocks, and that OPRA in turn will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate,
and Quotron.

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Description of the Proposal



A. General



The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the REIT Index, a new securities index developed by the CBOE and based
on REITs that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
The CBOE also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index that will be computed
at one-tenth of the value of the REIT Index. REIT Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular REIT
Index options traded on the Exchange;
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
According to the CBOE, the REIT Index represents a segment of the U.S. equity market that is not currently represented
in the derivative markets and, as such, the CBOE concludes, should offer investors a low-cost means of achieving diversification
or to tilt their portfolios toward, or away from, real estate investments. The CBOE believes that the Index will provide
retail and institutional investors with a means of benefitting from their forecasts about the financial performance
of REITS and their underlying real estate assets. Options on the Index also may be utilized by portfolio managers and
investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively and actively managed REITS, as well
as a means of hedging the risks of investing in real estate generally, the REIT stocks in particular.

<PARENT> FR940712-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. Composition of the Index



The Index is based on securities representing 25 REIT stocks that the Exchange believes are representative of the
REIT markets. The CBOE represents that the 25 REIT stocks have invested a preponderance of their assets in real property
(typically at least 75 percent), and the property portfolios owned by these REITs constitute a diverse pool of income-earning
real estate investments.

Twenty-three of the REIT stocks currently trade on the NYSE, and two trade on the Amex. All component stocks are ``reported
securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>


See

 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1. A ``reported security'' is defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this rule as ``any listed equity
security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to
an effective transaction reporting plan.'' A ``transaction reporting plan'' is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this
rule as ``any plan for collecting, processing, making available or disseminating transaction reports with respect
to transactions in reported securities filed with the Commission pursuant to, and meeting the requirements of, this
section.''

</FOOTNOTE>


As of the close of trading on June 10, 1994, the Index was valued at 212.55.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As of the close of trading on February 14, 1994, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index
ranged from a high of $1.1 billion (New Plan Reality) to a low of $220.2 million (Western Investment Real Estate Trust),
with a mean and median of $541.9 million and $518.7 million, respectively. The total market capitalization of the
securities in the Index was $13.5 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the REITs in the Index ranged
from a high of 49.1 million shares (New Plan Realty) to a low of 10.9 million shares (BRE Properties). The average price
per share of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period preceding February 14, 1994,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 ranged from a high of $39.90 (Weingarten Realty Investors) to a low of $6.99 (Rockefeller Center Properties). In addition,
the average daily trading volume of the REITs in the Index ranged from a high of 560,210 shares per day (Simon Property
Group)
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 to a low of 15,330 shares per day (BRE Properties), with the mean and median being 94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively.
Lastly, no one REIT accounted for more than 6.5 percent of the Index's total value (Weingarten Realty Investors and
Nationwide Health Properties), and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for
30.2 percent of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.1 percent of the
Index (Rockefeller Center Properties) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues accounted for 10.2
percent of the Index's value.

</FOOTNAME>
Trading data for these preceding six months were available for nineteen of the REIT stocks in the Index. Six of the component
REIT stocks commenced trading at various points of time within that six month period.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Simon Property Group commenced trading on December 14, 1993. The highest average daily trading volume for a REIT stock
which traded for the full six month period prior to February 14, 1994 was 122,800 shares (Rockefeller Center Properties).

</FOOTNOTE>


Four of the component stocks are currently the subject of trading in equity options, and the balance of the component
stocks meet the criteria for allowing the listing of equity options under CBOE Rule 5.3.



C. Maintenance



The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance
with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect conditions in REIT markets. If it becomes necessary to
replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to add new REITs that are representative
of REIT markets as a whole and will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition
of the proposed replacement security. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events,
such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase
the number of Index component securities to greater than 33 or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer
than 17, the CBOE will seek and obtain Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new
strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. In addition, in choosing replacement
securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90 percent of the weight of the Index continues
to be comprised of REITs that are eligible for standardized options trading.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>
The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying
an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) the public float must be at least 7,000,000
shares; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 shareholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million shares
over the preceding 12 months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days
during the preceding three calendar months. 

See

 CBOE Rule 5.3.

</FOOTNOTE>


D. Applicability of CBOE Rules Regarding Index Options



The rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding
trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based index options.



E. Calculation of the Index



The REIT Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities relative
to the Index's base date of January 3, 1994. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices of the
component REITs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of components of the Index
to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market
changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition of the Index. Changes that may
result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, removal and replacement of a component REIT stock,
component stock splits, and the financial restructuring of a component stock.

<DOCNO> FR940712-2-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940712-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Index will be calculated continuously and will be disseminated to OPRA every 15 seconds by the CBOE, based on the
last-sale prices of the component REITs.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 OPRA, in turn, will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
12

</FOOTNAME>
For purposes of the daily dissemination of the Index value, if a REIT included in the Index has not opened for trading,
the CBOE will use the closing value of that stock on the prior trading day when calculating the value of the Index, until
the stock opens for trading.

</FOOTNOTE>


F. Contract Specifications



The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Standard options trading hours (8:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. Central Standard Time) will apply to the contracts. The Index
multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for full-value Index options with a duration of one
year or less to expiration.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at any given time. Specifically,
there may be up to three expiration months from the March, June, September, and December cycle, plus up to three additional
near-term months so that the two nearest-term months will always be available. As described in more detail below,
the Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>
A European-style option can be exercised only during a specified period before the option expires.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
14

</FOOTNAME>
For a description of the strike price intervals for regular and reduced-value Index LEAPS, 

see infra

 Section II.H.

</FOOTNOTE>


G. Settlement of Index Options



Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration
Friday''), and the last trading day for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to last business
day before Expiration Friday (normally a Thursday). The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular
Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale
prices for each of the Index's component securities in their primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration
(

i.e.,

 Expiration Friday). Once all of the component REITs have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that
value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component REITs
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior trading day's (

i.e.,

 normally a Thursday) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use Thursday's
closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the CBOE will
wait until the end of the trading day on Expiration Friday.



H. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value REIT Index 



The Exchange's proposal provides that the Exchange may list LEAPS that expire from 12 to 36 months from the listing
based on the full-value REIT Index or a reduced-value REIT Index that will be computed at one-tenth the value of the
full-value Index, subject to existing Exchange requirements applicable to full-value and reduced-value LEAPS.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value REIT Index LEAPS will be computed by dividing the value of the
full-value Index by ten and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, an Index value
of 212.55 would be 21.26 for the reduced-value Index LEAPS, and 212.54 would become 21.25. The reduced-value Index
LEAPS will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all of the
Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures.
Pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, the strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50,
instead of $5.00.

I. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts



Because the Index is classified as an ``industry index'' under CBOE rules,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on narrow-based indexes will apply to the trading of REIT
Index options and LEAPS. Specifically, Exchange rules governing margin requirements,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 position and exercise limits,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and trading halt procedures
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 that are applicable to the trading of narrow-based index options will apply to options traded on the Index. For purposes
of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index LEAPS complies with applicable position and exercise
limits, positions in reduced-value Index LEAPS will be aggregated with positions in the full-value Index options.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 For these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
16

</FOOTNAME>


See

 CBOE Rule 24.1(i).


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
17

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.11, the margin requirements for the Index options will be: (1) for short options positions,
100 percent of the current market value of the options contract plus 20 percent of the underlying aggregate Index value,
less any out-of-the-money amount, with a minimum requirement of the options premium plus 10 percent of the underlying
aggregate Index value; and (2) for LEAPS positions, 100 percent of the options premium paid.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
18

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to CBOE Rules 24.4A and 24.5, respectively, the position and exercise limits for the Index options will be
10,500 contracts, unless the Exchange determines, pursuant to Rules 24.4A and 24.5, that a lower limit is warranted.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
19

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.7, the trading on the CBOE of Index options may be halted or suspended whenever trading in underlying
securities whose weighted value represents more than 20 percent of the Index value is halted or suspended.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

 CBOE Rule 24.4A(c).

J. Surveillance



Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options also will
be used to monitor trading in regular Index options and in full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. These procedures
include complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities. Further, the Intermarket Surveillance
Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on
the Index.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
21

</FOOTNAME>
The Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') was formed on July 14, 1983, among other things, to coordinate more
effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets.


See

 Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, dated July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which
incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29,
1990. 

See

 Second Amendment to Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, dated January 29, 1990. The members of the ISG are:
the Amex, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the CBOE; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Because of potential opportunities for trading abuses involving stock index futures, stock options, and the underlying
stock, and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for these potential intermarket trading abuses,
the major stock index futures exchanges (

e.g., 

 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade) joined the ISG as affiliate members in 1990.


</FOOTNOTE>


III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of REIT Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
REIT Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities
market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with REIT securities.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
22

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
23

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding
that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult
for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be
derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public
confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed
index options and full-value index LEAPS on the REIT Index will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should
reflect the overall movement of REIT securities in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that
these Index options will provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions in the REIT sector of
the U.S. securities markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets
in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be
traded on an index computed at one-tenth the value of the REIT index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing
them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term market moves at a reduced
cost.

However, the trading of options on the REIT Index, including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has adequately addressed these concerns.




A. Index Design and Structure 



The Commission finds that the REIT Index is a narrow-based index. The REIT Index is composed of only 25 securities,
all of which are REIT stocks.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the CBOE to apply its rules governing narrow-based
index options to trading in the Index options.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
24

</FOOTNAME>
The reduced-value REIT Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index, is identical to the
REIT Index, except that it is calculated by dividing the Index value by ten. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
25

</FOOTNAME>


See supra

 notes 16 through 20, and accompanying text. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the majority of
the components that comprise the Index are actively-traded, with a mean and median average daily trading volume of
94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $1.1 billion
to a low of $220.2 million, as of February 14, 1994, with the mean and median being $541.9 million and $518.7 million,
respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of 25 component securities, no one particular security
or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no individual REIT stock comprises more than 6.5 percent
of the Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 30.2 percent
of the Index's value.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Fourth all of the securities in the Index are eligible for standardized options trading (four of which currently underlie
exchange-listed options).
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed CBOE maintenance requirement that at least 90 percent of the weighting of the Index be comprised of securities
that are eligible for options trading will ensure that the Index is always substantially comprised of options eligible
securities. Fifth, if the CBOE increases the number of component securities to more than 33 or decreases that number
to less than 17, the CBOE will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before
listing new strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the CBOE's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the CBOE will
be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements in the United
States. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission
believes that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the REIT Index in any significant way through trading
in component REITs, coupled with existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, as discussed
below, will help deter such illegal activity.





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
26

</FOOTNAME>
In addition, for the six month period prior to February 14, 1994, no component of the Index had an average daily trading
volume of less than 15,300 shares per day.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
27

</FOOTNAME>
For an index with a significantly greater number of securities than 25 issues, the Commission might come to a different
conclusion if only a few securities accounted for a significant portion of the index's weighting. Further, if an index
contained only a few stocks, the Commission might question whether it could be traded as an index product. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
28

</FOOTNAME>


See supra

 note 11. 


</FOOTNOTE>


B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized,
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special
risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks
of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts.
Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized
options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the
protection of investors in REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value REIT Index LEAPS.

<DOCNO> FR940712-2-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940712-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

C. Surveillance


The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the NYSE and the Amex, which currently are the primary markets for the REITs comprising the Index, are
both members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information.

</FOOTNAME>


See supra 

note 21.
</FOOTNOTE>


D. Market Impact


The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the REIT Index, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 First, as described above, for the most part no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because
at least 90 percent of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's
options listing standards, the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities.
Third, the 10,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to
minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance
will be minimized because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by The Options Clearing Corporation
just like any other standardized option traded in the United States.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
31

</FOOTNAME>
In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those new
series of index options that would result from the introduction of options and LEAPS on the REIT Index. 

See 

Letter from Joseph P. Corrigan, Executive Director, OPRA, to Eileen Smith, CBOE, dated February 25, 1994.
</FOOTNOTE>


Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts,
valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help
reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
32

</FOOTNAME>


See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30944 (July 21, 1992), 57 FR 33376 (July 28, 1992).
</FOOTNOTE>


E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1


The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies the proposed rule change by making specific representations with respect to surveillance
and Index value dissemination. These representations are identical in all material respects to those made by the
Exchange in connection with similar proposals to list options on stock indexes.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission
believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's
proposal on an accelerated basis.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
33

</FOOTNAME>


See, e.g., 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33962 (April 25, 1994), 59 FR 22874 (May 3, 1994).
</FOOTNOTE>


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. Copies of such filings also will be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;05, and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;05), as amended, is approved.

Each broker, dealer and municipal securities dealer shall be subject to such procedures and amendments thereto in
the same manner as the broker, dealer and municipal securities dealer is subject to the rules of the Board.
Procedures and amendments thereto shall become effective no earlier than 10 business days after publication of such
procedures and amendments.
(d

) Access to Board Rules and Other Action. (No change.)


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The Board believes that the proposed rule change would increase the efficiency of both the implementation and operation
of Board rules involving the submission of information to the Board. The ``procedures'' contemplated by the proposed
rule change would concern only matters of a technical nature. The proposed rule change further provides that any procedures,
or amendment thereto, may be approved by the Board without the necessity of a formal Board meeting, pursuant to existing
rule A&hyph;4(d). Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides a mechanism by which action, ``other than action on proposed rules or
proposed amendment to rules of the Board,'' may be taken by written consent of the Board or by telephone poll of all Board
members.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, the Board will continue to file any matters with the Commission, as required, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Act, and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides that: Action by the Board, other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendments to
rules of the Board, may be taken without a meeting by written consent of the Board setting forth the action so taken or
by telephone poll of all members of the Board, provided that, in the case of action taken by telephone, the Board, at
a meeting, or the Chairman of the Board authorizes the action to be taken by such means. The Executive Director shall
transmit to each Board member, as soon as practicable after a telephone poll is taken, a written statement setting
forth the questions or questions with respect to which the telephone poll was taken and the results of the telephone
poll. Such statements shall also be entered in the minutes of the next Board meeting. In the case of action taken without
a meeting by written consent or telephone poll, an affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board is required.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission notes that the present proposal is intended to expedite Board consideration of matters that are technical
in nature, and is not intended to affect the types of proposals that the Board files with the Commission pursuant to
Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19(b)(4) thereunder. Telephone conversation, 

supra 

note 1.

</FOOTNOTE>


On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37, concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 This rule, among other things, requires dealers to submit certain information ``to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in
accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly with due dates determined by the Board. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In its filing with the Commission, the Board noted that it ``is in the process of developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37
filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37, as well as indexing,
record storage, etc. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In the present filing, the Board discussed these rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures as an example of the types of procedures
to which the instant proposed rule change would apply. The Board will submit to the Commission another proposed rule
change relating to rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures.

filing requirements of rule G&hyph;37, the Board intends to develop an informal ``Procedures Manual'' for the relevant
forms and procedures, and periodically to update or to amend the manual. The manual also would include forms and other
filing information regarding rule G&hyph;36 on delivery of official statements and advance refunding documents
to the Board. In the future, the Board also may adopt procedures regarding technical matters relating to the Board's
Continuing Disclosure Information system, as well as any transaction reporting system the Board may develop.

The Board has adopted the proposed rule change pursuant to section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act which provides that the
Board's rules shall:




Be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing settling, processing
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general to protect investors and the
public interest. *&blank;*&blank;*




In addition, Section 15B(b)(2)(I) authorizes the Board to adopt rules which provide for the operation and administration
of the Board.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, since it would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities
dealers.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board and therefore has become effective pursuant to Section
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing
of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the MSRB. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;3 and should be submitted by August
2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Interpretation of Rule G&hyph;15(a) on Customer Confirmations</DOCTITLE>



July 5, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ACT''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by MSRB. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988).

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



MSRB has filed an interpretation regarding Rule G&hyph;15(a). The new interpretation of the rule allows dealers
under certain circumstances to satisfy the Rule G&hyph;15(a)'s requirement that municipal securities customers
be provided a ``written'' confirmation by using the Thomson Financial Services, Inc. (``TFS'') OASYS Global System.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSRB included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The texts of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV, below. MSRB has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



MSRB's rule change allows the requirement of Rule G&hyph;15(a), that customers be provided ``written'' confirmation
at or before the completion of a transaction in municipal securities, to be satisfied by a contract confirmation message
(``CCM'') sent through the TFS OASYS Global System. The following conditions must be met before the OASYS Global System
may be used: (i) The customer and dealer have both agreed to use the OASYS Global system for purposes of confirmation
delivery; (ii) the CCM includes all information required by Rule G&hyph;15(a); and (iii) all other applicable requirements
and conditions concerning the OASYS Global system expressed in the Commission's October 8, 1993, no-action letter
concerning Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b&hyph;10 must continue to be met.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
The no-action letter of October 8, 1993, stated that the Commission staff will not recommend enforcement action to
the Commission if broker-dealers rely on the OASYS Global system's CCMs to satisfy the requirements of a confirmation
of Rule 10b&hyph;10 of the Act provided (i) The CCMs can be printed or downloaded by the participants, (ii) the recipient
of a CCM must respond through the system affirming or rejecting the trade, (iii), the CCMs will not be automatically
deleted by the system, and (iv) the use of the system by the participants ensures that both parties to the transaction
have the capacity to receive the CCMs. Letter from Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation,
SEC, to MariAnne Pisarri, Esq., Pickard and Djinis (October 8, 1993).

</FOOTNOTE>


MSRB understands that TFS's OASYS Global system is not a registered securities clearing agency and is not linked with
other registered securities clearing agencies for purposes of automated confirmation/acknowledgment required
under Rule G&hyph;15(d). Therefore, under these circumstances, use of the OASYS system will not constitute compliance
with Rule G&hyph;15(d) regarding automated confirmation/acknowledgement.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
MSRB Rule 15(d)(ii) states, among other things, that no broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer who is or whose
clearing agent is a participant in a clearing agency registered with the Commission shall effect a transaction in
any municipal security to which a CUSIP number has been assigned on a delivery-versus-payment basis or on a receipt-versus-payment
basis for the account of a customer whose clearing agent with respect to such transfer is a participant in such a clearing
agency or in a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency unless the facilities of
such clearing agency or the facilities of a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency
are used for the confirmation and acknowledgment of such transaction.

</FOOTNOTE>


MSRB has adopted the rule change pursuant to Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that MSRB's rules shall:




be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and
perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and
the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers.
Moreover, the rule change only applies when dealers and customers agree between themselves to use TFS's OASYS Global
system.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



MSRB has not solicited or received comments on the proposed rule change. MSRB's consideration of the proposed rule
change was prompted by an interpretive inquiry from TFS regarding the interpretation of Rule G&hyph;15(a).



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(1)
of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because it relates to the interpretation of the meaning of an existing rule. At any time
within sixty days of filing of the rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears
to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors,
or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested people are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. People making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at MSRB's principal offices. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;8
and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval on a Temporary Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Limiting the Use of Letters of Credit To Collateralize
Clearing Fund Contributions</DOCTITLE>



July 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on June 17, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;10)
as described below. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons
and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change through September 30, 1994.

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988).

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 increases the minimum cash clearing fund contribution for those members who use letters of credit as clearing fund
collateral and sets a limit on the amount of a member's required clearing fund contribution that may be collateralized
with letters of credit.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The proposed rule change was originally filed on October 27, 1989 and was approved temporarily through December 31,
1990. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27664 (January 31, 1990), 55 FR 4297 (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;16).
Subsequently, the Commission granted a number of extensions to the temporary approval to allow the Commission and
NSCC sufficient time to review and assess the use of letters of credit as clearing fund collateral. Most recently temporary
approval was granted until June 30, 1994. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32551 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36727 (File
No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;5).

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC is seeking permanent approval of a proposed rule change that modifies the amount of a member's required clearing
fund deposit that may be collateralized by letters of credit. Specifically, the proposed rule change increases the
minimum cash contribution for those members who use letters of credit from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10%
of their required clearing fund deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the rule change provides that only
70% of a member's required clearing fund deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit. The rule change also
adds headings to the clearing fund formula section for purposes of clarity and includes other nonsubstantive drafting
changes. The effect of the proposed rule change is to increase the liquidity of the clearing fund and to limit NSCC's
exposure to unusual risks resulting from the reliance on letters of credit.

Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing, NSCC has filed clearing fund composition reports with
the Commission. NSCC states that since December 31, 1989, as a result of the new requirements, it has observed the following
changes in the composition of the clearing fund:

1. Cash deposits have increased by approximately 225%;

2. The value of securities deposited has increased by approximately 205%;
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
Securities eligible for deposit as clearing fund collateral include U.S. or municipal bonds in the first or second
rating of any nationally known statistical service. NSCC Rule 4, &sect;1.

</FOOTNOTE>


3. Letter of credit deposits have declined by approximately 40%.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
4

</FOOTNAME>
In October of 1989 when the Commission initially granted temporary approval of NSCC's proposal, letters of credit
accounted for 76% of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits. By May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted
for less than 30%. During the period from June 1, 1992 to May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for an average of 30.49%
of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits, and for no month during that period did the portion of
letters of credit used for required clearing fund deposits rise above 34%. Letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President/Director
of Legal &amp; Associate General Counsel, NSCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June
10, 1993).

</FOOTNOTE>


NSCC states that the proposal is consistent with its requirements under Section 17A of the Act because it enhances
NSCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or under its control.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


No new written comments have been solicited or received.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments it receives.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Since the initial filing of the proposed rule change NSCC has received one letter of comment. In the letter Wedbush
Morgan Securities, Inc. opposed the NSCC's proposal because they believe it would increase the cost of posting collateral.
Letter from Edward W. Wedbush, President, Wedbush Morgan Securities, Inc., to David F. Hoyt, Assistant Secretary,
NSCC (November 9, 1989).
</FOOTNOTE>


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that a clearing agency's rules be designed, among other things, to ensure
the safeguarding of securities and funds in its possession or control or for which it is responsible and to protect
investors and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 NSCC's proposal to limit the use of letters of credit to collateralize clearing fund obligations will make NSCC's
clearing fund more liquid. A liquid clearing fund is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of a clearing agency.
NSCC's proposal is therefore consistent with the requirements under the Act with regard to NSCC's obligation to safeguard
securities and funds and to protect the interests of investors and of the public.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988).
</FOOTNOTE>


Although letters of credit are a useful means of funding clearing agency guarantee deposits, their unrestricted
use may present risks to clearing agencies. Because letters of credit reflect the issuer's promise to pay funds upon
presentation of stipulated documents by the holder, a clearing agency holding letters of credit will be exposed to
risk should the issuer refuse to honor its promise to pay. Furthermore, because under the Uniform Commercial Code
the issuer may defer honoring a payment request until the close of business on the third banking day following receipt
of the required documents, the clearing agency either may have to await payment or may have to seek alternative short-term
financing. This waiting period could reduce a clearing agency's liquidity and thereby could hinder its ability to
meet its payment obligations on a timely basis.
As indicated above, since the proposal first received temporary approval, NSCC has experienced over a 200% increase
in the deposit of cash and securities deposited as clearing fund collateral. Because cash and securities are generally
more liquid than letters of credit, the enhanced level of such deposits helps to ensure the liquidity of the clearing
fund in the event of a major member insolvency, catastrophic loss, or major settlement loss. By reducing the risk associated
with the use of letters of credit, the proposal is consistent with NSCC's responsibilities under the Act to safeguard
securities or funds in its custody or control and to protect investors and the public in general.
NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
accelerated approval of the proposal will keep effective NSCC's rules that help reduce the exposure of NSCC's clearing
fund to the potential liquidity risks associated with using letters of credit to collateralize members' clearing
fund obligations. Moreover, since it was first introduced in 1989, NSCC's proposal has been open for public comment
and has elicited only one opposing comment. Thus the Commission does not foresee that approval of the proposal will
elicit further opposition.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;10
and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.


V. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule filing is consistent with the Act and in particular
with Section 17A of the Act.


It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;10) be, and hereby is approved through September

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Small Order Execution System Tier Size Classifications</DOCTITLE>



July 6, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is submitting this filing to effectuate The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s (``Nasdaq'') periodic reclassification
of Nasdaq National Market (``NNM'') securities into appropriate tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size
tiers for Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq market
makers in NNM securities. Since the NASD's proposal is an interpretation of existing NASD rules, there are no language
changes.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the rule change is to effectuate Nasdaq's periodic reclassification of NNM securities into appropriate
tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size tiers for SOES and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq
market makers in NNM securities. Nasdaq reviews the tier level applicable to each security periodically (approximately
every six months) to determine if the trading characteristics of the issue have changed so as to warrant a tier level
adjustment. Such a review was conducted as of February 28, 1994, using the following established criteria:
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
The classification criteria is set forth in footnote 1 to Section (a)(7) of the SOES Rules and Section 2(a) of Part V
of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws.

</FOOTNOTE>


NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of 3,000 shares or more a day, a bid price less than or equal to
$100, and three or more market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 1,000 shares and a maximum
SOES order size of 500 shares;
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
On December 23, 1993, the Commission approved a reduction in the maximum SOES tier size to 500 shares from 1,000 shares.


See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33377 (Dec. 23, 1993), 58 FR 69419 (Dec. 30, 1993). Even though the maximum order
size for SOES is now 500 shares, Nasdaq has continued to classify NNM securities within the 1,000 share tier size because
Nasdaq market makers must continue to display a size of 1,000 shares in their quotations for these securities, and
remain firm for a minimum of 1,000 shares at their publicized quotations in these securities for orders outside of
SOES.
</FOOTNOTE>


NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of 1,000 shares or more a day, a bid price less than or equal to
$150, and two or more market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 500 shares and a maximum SOES
order size of 500 shares; and

NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of less than 1,000 shares a day, a bid price less than or equal
to $250, and less than two market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 200 shares and a maximum
SOES order size of 200 shares.







Pursuant to the application of this classification criteria, 500 NNM securities will be reclassified effective
July 11, 1994. These 500 NNM securities are set out in the NASD's 

Notice To Members 

94&hyph;48 (June 1994).

In ranking NNM securities pursuant to the established classification criteria, Nasdaq followed the changes dictated
by the criteria with two exceptions. First, an issue was not moved more than one tier size level. For example, if an issue
was previously categorized in the 1,000-share tier size, it would not be permitted to move to the 200-share tier even
if the reclassification criteria showed that such a move was warranted. In adopting this policy, Nasdaq was attempting
to maintain adequate public investor access to the market for issues in which the tier size level decreased and minimize
market maker exposure in issues for which the tier size level increased. Second, for eight securities priced below
$1 where the reclassification called for a reduction in tier size, Nasdaq determined not to recommend a decline in
tier size given the low price of these securities and the negligible effect on market maker exposure. As a result, five
securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 200 shares from 500 shares remained at 500 shares and three
securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 500 shares from 1,000 shares remained at 1,000 shares.

The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section
15A(b)(11) applies to the form and content of quotations. Section 15A(b)(11) requires that rules relating to quotations
must be fair and informative so as to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations.
The NASD believes that the reassignment of NNM securities within SOES tier size levels and minimum quotation size
levels will further these ends by providing an efficient mechanism for small, retail investors to execute their orders
on Nasdaq and providing investors with the assurance that they can effect trades up to a certain size at the quotations
displayed on Nasdaq.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The proposed rule change has become effective immediately pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b&hyph;4 because the reranking of NNM securities into appropriate order size
tiers and quotation size requirements was done pursuant to the NASD's stated policy and practice with respect to the
administration and enforcement of two existing NASD rules. Further, in the SOES Tier Size Order,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission requested that the NASD provide this information as an interpretation of an existing NASD rule under
section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Fine Schedule for the Rule on Dissemination of Quotations in Local Issues </DOCTITLE>



July 6, 1994. 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The PSE is proposing to amend its fine schedule for violations of Equity Floor Procedure Advice 2&hyph;B, relating
to the dissemination of quotations in local issues. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose 


Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') 2&hyph;B of the Rules of the Pacific Stock Exchange is designed to enforce
the requirement that PSE specialists disseminate quotations in their assigned local issues every day. Specifically,
the specialist must disseminate a quote prior to one-half (1/2) hour after the PSE opening. 

In order to enforce this requirement, EFPA 2&hyph;B has a schedule that requires that all specialists be monitored
daily on a rotating quarterly basis. Failure to satisfy the requirement currently results in a $25 fine for each violation
beginning with the sixth violation. 

At this time, the PSE is proposing to amend this rule to provide that the fine be changed to $100 with an implementation
upon the third violation. It is the position of the Exchange that this will provide an effective deterrent and reflect
a more appropriate penalty for non-compliance with EFPA 2&hyph;B. 



2. Statutory Basis 


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, is general, and Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6),
in particular, in that it is designed to protect investors and the public interest, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to assure that Exchange members are appropriately disciplined.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Burden on Competition 



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such other period (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;13
and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Incorporated, Relating to a One Hundred Twenty (120) Day Extension of Municipal Bond
Trading Pilot Program</DOCTITLE>



July 5, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on July 1, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the
proposed rule change from interested persons, and simultaneously publishing an order granting accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') proposes to extend the municipal bond trading
pilot program for an additional 120 days until November 2, 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On March 7, 1994, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to establish new rules for the listing and trading of
municipal securities on the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission approved the pilot for an interim period of 120 days through July 5, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange is now requesting a 120-day extension of the pilot in order to provide additional time for evaluation
of the program.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See Exchange Act Release No. 33721 (March 7, 1994), 59 FR 11636 (March 11, 1994) (granting temporary accelerated approval

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade,
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling and processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and, in general will contribute to the protection
of investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Exchange requests that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

. PSE believes it appropriate to approve the proposed rule change so that it may have time to evaluate its program for
listing qualified municipal securities. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change extending the PSE pilot
program is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the
PSE and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof in that PSE requires additional time to evaluate the
pilot before it can file a request for permanent approval of the listing of municipal securities.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;21
and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved through November
2, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Specialist Participation in the After-Hours Trading Facility in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and Investment
Trust Securities Based on Stock Indexes</DOCTITLE>



July 5, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed

(1) Permanent approval of the After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') Facility; and (2) approval on a pilot basis for specialists
in investment trust securities based on stock indexes to participate in the AHT Facility. The Commission approved
the portion of the filing that requested permanent approval of the AHT Facility in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 33993.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 On August 3, 1993, the Exchange amended the filing to request that specialists in Portfolio Depository Receipts (``PDRs'')
also be permitted to participate in the AHT Facility.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 On July 5, 1994, the Exchange amended the proposed rule change to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to permit specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and investment trust securities to
participate in the Exchange's After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility for a one year pilot period.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange requests Commission approval for specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs'') and investment
trust securities listed pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the
specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately
prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule
amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange currently lists one Portfolio Depositary Receipt, 

viz

., Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs''); and two investment trust securities pursuant to Section
118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines: LOR Index Trust SuperUnits and LOR Money Market SuperUnits.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange also seeks Commission approval for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate
in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member
organization has a direct or indirect interest. For example, under the Exchange's proposal, the specialist in SPDRs
would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15 close of the regular trading 

 session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs for execution in the AHT facility
as a closing price coupled order. Such a capability would conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities
to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close
of the regular trading session to take the contra side of a customer basket order and the closing index value. Specialists
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') currently are permitted to take the contra side of a customer order
to buy or sell a particular equity security and enter such order into the NYSE's Off-Hours Trading facility as a closing
price coupled order. The Exchange seeks a similar capability for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities
to conform the trading of these listed instruments to the practices of the basket market.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940712-2-00097 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940712-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the
AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors
by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market
indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected
in markets other than the Amex. The specialist in such securities has no unique access to market sensitive information
regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange, therefore, believes that
specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in the manner described above
does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for an execution at the closing
price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the close of the AHT session at
5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours session.) A customer,
therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price suits its needs, and
may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives.
The Exchange also proposes to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from
the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility to eliminate any concern with the handling of such orders.
The Exchange proposes that the Commission approve the Exchange's application to permit specialist participation
in the AHT facility for PDRs and investment trust securities on a pilot basis, during which time the Exchange will study
the operation of the facility to determine if there are any additional issues that need to be addressed.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just
and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect of the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Additions to Its Minor Rule Violation Plan</DOCTITLE>


July 5, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 6, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The BSE seeks to amend its Minor Rule Violation Plan (``Plan'') to provide for the imposition of summary fines for violation
of certain specified Exchange rules and policy by revising the List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable
Thereto Pursuant to Section 4 of Chapter XVIII (``List'') for the imposition of fines by adding the following rule
and policy violations:
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The BSE also has requested approval, under Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2), 17 CFR 240.19&hyph;1(c)(2), to amend its Rule
19d&hyph;1 minor rule violation enforcement and reporting plan to include these policy violations. 

See

 letter from Karen Aluise, Staff Attorney, to Sandy Sciole, Special Counsel, Division, dated April 28, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


1. Failure to Promptly Respond to Exchange Blue Sheet Requests or File Regularly Scheduled Financial (FOCUS, SIPC)
and/or Regulatory Reports (Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire, Quarterly Option Report);


2. Improper Use of the ITS Administrative Message Function; and

3. Failure to Register Floor Employees and Complete Appropriate Forms.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange's Plan provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2,500, on any member, member organization,
allied member, approved person, registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor
violation of certain specified Exchange rules.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
The BSE's Plan for enforcing and reporting minor disciplinary rule violations was approved by the Commission in Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438&hyph;I (April 24, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;88&hyph;2).

</FOOTNOTE>


The purpose of the Plan is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a sanction is appropriate but when initiation
of a full disciplinary proceeding is not suitable because such proceeding would be more costly and onerous than would
be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. The Plan provides for an appropriate response to minor violations
of certain Exchange rules while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required
procedures.

In the Exchange's initial filing which set forth the provisions and procedures of the Plan, the Exchange indicated
that it periodically would amend the list of rules subject to the Plan as the Exchange deemed appropriate. The Exchange
now seeks to add the aforementioned rules and policy to the List.



2. Statutory Basis



The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(6) of the Act, in that its members and persons associated
with its members will be appropriately disciplined for violation of rules and policies where the Exchange has determined
that such violation is minor in nature. In accordance with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act, the Plan provides
for a fair disciplinary procedure for the imposition of sanctions.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;08
and should be submitted by August 2, 1994.

On January 14, 1994, the Phlx submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposal: (1) To correct the description of the formula
for calculating the value of the Index; (2) to set the exercise prices at 5 point intervals instead of 21/2 point intervals;
(3) to provide that if the number of components in the Index increases to more than 21 components or decreases to less
than 11 components, the Exchange shall submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(4) of the Act;
and (4) to require that the components of the Index will be required to be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange

See

 Letter from William Uchimoto, General Counsel, Phlx, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives and Equity
Oversight (``ODEO''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), SEC, dated January 14, 1994. On April 26, 1994,
the Phlx filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposal which: (1) provides that the index will be updated during the trading
day at least once every 15 seconds, rather than once every minute; (2) specifies that the expiration cycle applicable
to options of the Index will be three expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional
near-term months; (3) provides that additional exercise prices will be added pursuant to Rule 1101A rather than Rule
1012; and (4) clarifies the Exchange's obligations with respect to delisting and replacing components of the Index.


See

 Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, ODEO, Division,
SEC, dated April 26, 1994. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 3 to the proposal on May 20, 1994, to provide that the Index
will be maintained so that if at any time, less than 90% of the component issues by weight are eligible for exchange options
trading, the Exchange will submit a Rule 19b&hyph;4 filing to the Commission before opening any new series of options
on the Index for trading.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Semiconductor Index (``Index''),
an index developed by the Phlx and comprised of sixteen of the most highly capitalized and widely-held U.S. stocks
representing the semiconductor industry.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

The Phlx proposes to list for trading American-style options
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 on the Index, a price-weighted index composed of sixteen highly capitalized and widely held common stocks of U.S.
companies that are primarily involved in the design, manufacture, sale and distribution of semiconductors used
in computer and other electronic device manufacturing.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange proposes classifying the Index as a narrow-based industry index.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
An American-style option can be exercised at any time before the option expires.

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The components of the Index are: Advanced Micro Devices; Analog Devices; Applied Materials; Cypress Semiconductor;
Integrated Device Technology; Intel Corp. International Rectifier Corp.; Lattice Semiconductor Corp.; LSI Logic
Corp.; Micron Technology Inc.; Motorola Inc.; National Semiconductor Corp.; Novellus Systems, Inc.; Teradyne,
Inc.; Texas Instruments, Inc.; and VLSI Technology, Inc.

</FOOTNOTE>


The formula for calculating the Index is as follows:





<IMPORT>



E:GRAPHICSEN12JY94.000


</IMPORT>



where:




SP=Current stock price for each component.

BASE=Base Value; Number by which the Index is initially normalized to a value of 200.







The current price of each component issue is multiplied by 100 shares. The resulting market values are added to determine
the current aggregate market value of the issues in the Index. To compute the current Index value, the aggregate market
value is divided by the base divisor. The value of the Index was set to equal 200 on December 1, 1993.

Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index
are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (current stock price &times; 100 shares) of the relevant issues.

The Index value will be updated dynamically at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Phlx has retained
Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index values will be disseminated
and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association and over the facilities
of the Options Price Reporting Authority. The Index value will also be available on broker/dealer interrogation
devices to subscribers of the option information.

In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index occurs as a result of delisting,
merger, acquisition or otherwise, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this stock from the Index and
replace it with another stock which the Exchange believes would be compatible with the intended market character
of the Index. In making replacement determinations, the Exchange will also take into account the capitalization,
liquidity, and volatility of a particular stock.

Index options will be traded pursuant to the current Phlx rules governing the trading of index options, particularly
Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, and generally, Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070.

The settlement value for Index options will be based on the opening values of the component securities on the date prior
to expiration. Index options will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month, and the
last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration
date.

The Phlx proposes to employ position and exercise limits pursuant to Phlx Rule 1001A(b) (i) and 1002A, respectively.
Exercise price intervals will be initially set at 5 point intervals and additional exercise prices will be added in
accordance with Phlx Rule 1101A(a).

The Phlx will trade consecutive and cycle month series pursuant to Phlx Rule 1101A. Specifically, there will be three
expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months so that the
three nearest term months will always be available.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate transactions
in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 20, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,

</FOOTNAME>
The exact language of the proposal was included as Exhibit 1 to File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;6 and can be examined
at the locations specified in Item IV below.

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements governing the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(1) Purpose



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to make certain structural and technical changes to Chapter XV (``Dealer-Specialists'').
Primarily, the Exchange seeks to provide paragraph numbering for ease of reference. In addition, the Exchange seeks
to remove outdated and repetitive language, such as reference to the Business Conduct Committee which is now the Market
Performance Committee. Certain paragraphs have been relocated to sections which are more applicable, and clarifying
language has been added to certain sections.



(2) Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is section 6(b)(5) in that the rule is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;6

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Relating to European-Term and Cross-Rate Customized Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>


July 5, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend pending new Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to provide for the ability to: (1) Trade European-term option contracts on any foreign currency on which the Phlx currently
trades foreign currency options (``FCOs''); (2) trade cross-rate FCOs on any two such approved currencies; and (3)
allow users to quote all customized FCOs in percentage terms. Proposed Rule 1069, as well as existing Rules 1000, 1009,
1014, 1033, and 1034, would be amended accordingly. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office
of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission.

</FOOTNOTE>


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On March 4, 1994, the Phlx filed with the Commission a proposal (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to allow FCO traders and their customers to have the ability, within specified limits, to designate their own option
exercise price parameters on a trade. In that filing, the Exchange proposed to allow its users to dictate the specific
strike price of an FCO contract that they would like to buy or sell without requiring the Exchange to continuously disseminate
quotes for these options. For example, if the Exchange has listed June .5450 and .5500 Deutsche mark calls and the customer
wants to trade June .5487 Deutsche mark calls, the customer could request a quote in this option and the trade could
occur. The Exchange, however, would not have to continuously disseminate quotes for this option until expiration
because this may be the only trade that ever occurs in this series.

The Exchange is now proposing to expand upon its proposed FCO customization contained in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11.
If File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 as well as the present proposal are approved, the Exchange would be able
to offer the ability for its participants to trade non-standardized strike prices on existing series of FCOs as well
as ``inverse'' or European-term contracts on those currencies presently listed on the Exchange, and cross-rate
contracts on any two of the existing eight currencies on which the Exchange presently lists FCOs (i.e.,

 the British pound, Swiss franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,
and European Currency Unit).


European-Term FCOs


The first addition to the array of previously proposed customized FCOs that the Exchange now proposes to offer is the
European-term contract. The Exchange presently lists options on eight foreign currencies. Each of these FCO contracts
is structured so that the trading currency is the U.S. dollar (

e.g.,

 French franc/U.S. dollar). The option is quoted in U.S. dollars per unit of the relevant foreign currency and the premium
is paid in U.S. dollars. Upon exercise of a call option, for example, the relevant foreign currency would be delivered.
The European-term customized FCO contract would be the inverse of the FCO contracts just described (

e.g.,

 U.S. dollar/French franc). The option will be quoted in units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar and the premium
will be paid in the foreign currency. Because the underlying currency is the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollars will be delivered
upon exercise of a call option. The title of proposed Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 will be changed to ``Customized Options'' to reflect the fact that users will be able to customize FCO contracts in
more aspects than merely the strike price. Exchange Rule 1000(13), which provides the definition of ``foreign currency,''
will also be amended to include the U.S. dollar so that U.S. dollars may be considered an underlying foreign currency
under all applicable Exchange rules. Similarly, Rule 1009, which lists all of the approved underlying foreign currencies
would also be amended, as well as the definitions of ``spot sales price'' and ``forward sales price'' in Rules 1000(16)
and 1000(17).

Cross-Rate FCOs


The second proposed addition to the customized FCO facility proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11
would allow the Exchange to offer the ability to trade any cross-rate FCO contract on any two foreign currencies approved
for trading on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 1009.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For example, an option on the Swiss franc/Canadian dollar could be traded. The Exchange believes, however, that it
would be inefficient to disseminate updated quotes on all of the possible combinations of cross-rate FCOs that could
be created by all of the listed currencies now available. The Exchange believes that most will not be of wide spread
interest but may appeal to only a limited number of customers or be active for only brief periods of time due to unpredictable
political or economic events in the U.S. and abroad.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange presently offers two standardized cross-rate FCOs, the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen and the British
pound/Deutsche mark. The Exchange also has approval to trade the British pound/Japanese yen, however, it has not
yet been made available for trading. See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29919 (November 7, 1991), 56 FR 58109 (November 15, 1991).

Alternative Order Formats


Finally, the Exchange proposes to offer the ability to request quotes and receive quotes in terms of a percentage of
the underlying currency in addition to the present unit of currency format (

i.e.

, cents per unit of the underlying currency). Percentage quoting would be offered on all FCOs available through the
proposed customized FCO facility. The Exchange represents that many users of FCOs have requested this quotation
method and the Exchange believes it is appropriate to offer it in this limited fashion through the proposed customized
FCO facility. Unit of currency quotations will also still be available for the proposed customized FCOs.
The Exchange states that the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market has traditionally given its users the ability to
customize FCO contracts by allowing them to designate many if not all of the terms of the FCO contracts. The participants
in the OTC market, according to the Exchange, are typically institutional investors, corporations, and banks, who
buy and sell FCOs in large size transactions in order to hedge risks relating to fluctuating exchange rates. By trading
in the OTC market, these users do not benefit from the advantages offered by an organized exchange, such as, transparency,
margin and collateral, and secondary market liquidity. The Exchange is now proposing to give these users the flexibility
of the OTC market by allowing them to trade and quote FCO contracts tailored to their specifications but within the
confines of an exchange environment. By having the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') as the issuer and guarantor
of the customized FCOs, it will eliminate concern over contra-party creditworthiness and assure performance upon
exercise of the customized FCOs. Finally, the Exchange believes that transparency will be achieved by the real time
dissemination of the quotes, requests for quotes, and last sale information through the Options Price Reporting
Authority (``OPRA'').


Applicability of Existing Exchange Rules


European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs would be subject to all Exchange rules and regulations regarding surveillance
and sales practice. Unless specifically exempted, all floor trading procedures will also be adhered to. Examples
of different procedures for the proposed European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs include no continuous quoting,
no opening or closing rotations, size restrictions as to exercise, new minimum fractional changes, and new maximum
quote spread parameters. Position and exercise limits for European-term customized FCOs would be the same as those
applicable to FCOs on the same foreign currency and positions in these options will be aggregated with existing FCOs
in calculating position and exercise limits. For example, U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark FCOs will be aggregated with
Deutsche mark/U.S. dollar FCO positions. The Exchange will establish separate position limits for the cross-rate
customized FCOs.
The minimum quote and transaction sizes that the Exchange proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 for
customized strike FCOs will also apply to customized European-term and cross-rate FCOs.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, quotes may not be requested and trades may not be executed in a series with no open interest for less than
300 contracts. Responsive quotes for series with no open interest must be at least 300 contracts for assigned ROTs
and 100 contracts for non-assigned ROTs. Responsive quotes and transactions in currently opened series may be the
lesser of 100 contracts or the remaining number of contracts for all participants.

 File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11,

Financial Responsibility


 The Exchange will impose higher net capital requirements for ROTs trading in customized FCOs. Assigned ROTs will
be subject to a $1 million minimum net liquid assets requirement and all other ROTs will be subject to a $250,000 minimum
net liquid assets requirement. European-term customized FCOs will be margined in the same fashion as existing FCO
contracts. The Exchange proposes to allow spread margin treatment for European-term contracts offset against corresponding
standardized contracts in instances in which the long notional value of either the European-term or standardized
contract equals or exceeds the short national value of the other side.
Cross-rate customized FCOs will be margined using a three tier system. The Exchange will look at the correlation coefficients
between any two currency combinations for each of the 28 possible (non-U.S. dollar) cross-rates in order to determine
whether the two currencies have high, low, or negative correlations. Margin levels will be set by using a tier system
based upon the degree of correlation between the different currencies. Historically, for example, the Exchange
states that there has been a very high correlation between the French franc, Swiss franc, Deutsche mark, and the European
Currency Unit (Tier I). Thus, the margin levels necessary for a cross-rate based on any two of these currencies should,
the Exchange believes, be low. The correlations between any Tier I currency and either the British pound or the Japanese
yen (Tier II) are, according to the Exchange, slightly lower and would, therefore, require higher margin levels.
Finally, the Exchange states that the correlations between any of the currencies in Tiers I or II and either the Canadian
dollar or the Australian dollar (Tier III) are extremely low or negative, thereby requiring a higher margin level
than the other two. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to establish margin levels of 2% for cross-rate FCOs based
upon any two currencies within Tier 1; 4% for cross-rate FCOs based on one Tier I currency and one Tier II currency or
two Tier II currencies; and 6% for FCOs based on one Tier III currency and one Tier I or Tier II currency or two Tier III
currencies. After the cross-rate customized FCOs are trading, the Exchange will review the correlations quarterly
to see if any of the currencies are eligible for placement in another tier based upon the correlation over the prior
quarter.

Transparency



When a request for a customized FCO quote is voiced in the trading crowd, it will be displayed and all responsive quotes
will also be displayed. Once a trade is consummated, it will be reported to OPRA and disseminated as an administrative
text message over the OPRA system. The Exchange will not be obligated to make continuous markets in customized FCOs,
even where open interest has been created. OCC will clear and settle the customized FCOs. Because quotes in these options
will not be continuously updated or otherwise priced by the Exchange, OCC will generate a theoretical price based
on the prices and quotes of the customized FCOs, prices of standardized series and the closing value of the underlying
foreign currency. OCC will use this price to mark the FCOs daily and calculate margin requirements.



Miscellaneous Corrections



Because this rule filing is proposing to change language in Rules 1009 and 1033, the Exchange is also proposing to correct
some inaccurate or redundant information contained in those rules. First, the Exchange believes that Commentary
.01(6) of Rule 1009 is almost identical to subsection (c) of that rule and is therefore proposed to be deleted. Secondly,
the contract size of the British pound and the French franc, as approved by the Commission, are 31,250 pounds
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and 250,000 francs,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 not 12,500 pounds and 125,000 francs as currently stated in Phlx's rules. These sizes and corresponding examples
of how to calculate the premium on these FCOs are being corrected in Rule 1033.

and facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest by providing foreign currency
option market participants with strike prices more closely suited to their trading strategies.

Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On October
12, 1984, applicant registered under the Act and filed a registration statement pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act.
The registration statement became effective on December 21, 1984, and the initial public offering commenced on January
25, 1985.
2. At a Special Meeting held on December 2, 1993, the board of trustees of applicant voted to approve an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization (the ``Plan'') and called a Special Meeting of the shareholders of applicant to vote on the
Plan. Pursuant to the Plan, the assets of applicant were transferred to Dean Witter Value-Added Market Series, a Massachusetts
business trust (``Value-Added'') in exchange for shares of Value-Added (the ``Reorganization'').
3. In approving the Reorganization, the directors considered a number of factors, including, (a) the comparative
investment performance and past growth in assets of applicant and Value-Added, (b) the comparative expenses of applicant
and Value-Added, (c) the impact on applicant's security holders if applicant were not reorganized or were liquidated,
(d) the compatibility of the investment objectives, policies, restrictions, and portfolios of applicant and Value-Added,
(e) the terms and conditions of the Reorganization that would affect the price of Value-Added shares to be issued in
the Reorganization, (f) the tax-free nature of the Reorganization, and (g) any direct or indirect costs to be incurred
by applicant and Value-Added in connection with the Reorganization.
4. Applicant and Value-Added could be deemed affiliated persons of each other within the meaning of the Act. In accordance
with rule 17a&hyph;8, the board of trustees of applicant determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Value-Added
was in the best interests of applicant and applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders
would not be diluted as a result of applicant effecting the transaction.
5. Preliminary proxy materials were filed on December 3, 1993, as part of Value-Added's registration statement on
Form N&hyph;14. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were filed on February 25, 1993. Applicant's
shareholders voted to approve the Plan on April 14, 1994.
6. As of April 15, 1994, applicant had 12,702,132.755 shares outstanding, at a net asset value of $8.38 per share and
an aggregate net asset value of $106,440,011.49. Pursuant to the Plan, the assets of applicant were transferred to
Value-Added in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of Value-Added. The aggregate net asset value of shares
of Value-Added issued in the Reorganization was equal to the value of applicant's assets on April 15, 1994 (the business
day immediately preceding the Reorganization) less applicant's liabilities. Applicant thereafter distributed
the Value-Added shares it received to its security holders by crediting each security holder with a 

pro rata 

portion of Value-Added shares equal to the security holder's investment in applicant.
7. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the Reorganization. The cost of printing and mailing the
proxy statement and any additional material relating to the stockholder meeting at which the Plan and the Reorganization
were approved, and the cost of soliciting proxies, including legal and accounting fees in connection with the preparation
of the proxy statement, was paid by applicant. Any expenses related to the shareholders of Value-Added, in connection
with the Reorganization, were paid by Value-Added.
8. At the time of the application, applicant had no security holders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not now engaged in, and does not propose to engage in,
any business activities.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces that it will prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed North Carolina Global TransPark (GTP) located at the Kinston
Regional Jetport.


</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 

Thomas M. Roberts, Federal Aviation Administration, Atlanta Airports District Office, 1680 Phoenix Parkway, Suite

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will prepare an environmental
impact statement for the Global TransPark and Section 404 Permit application. The EIS will investigate the expansion
of the existing Kinston Regional Jetport to accommodate the GTP. The proposed improvements consist of providing
for the construction and operation of a new 11,500-foot runway, together with related taxiways, and other related
facilities, along with land acquisition and land use planning. The proposed project also includes other primary
infrastructure, such as roadway improvements, areas for industrial development and a central cargo facility to
move products in and out of the complex.


The EIS is anticipated to address impacts on wetlands, historic properties, and so forth.
The EIS will also evaluate cumulative impacts anticipated to occur as a result of the implementation of other foreseeable
improvements at the GTP in the future.
The North Carolina Global TransPark Authority (Authority) issued a Request For Proposals inviting local governments
and other public and/or private groups interested in being the site for GTP to present written proposals of their qualifications
of the site and surrounding area. The RFP requested that the proponent furnish information on environmental factors
as well as services, quality of life, zoning and permitting, and financial participations on the site and area. Eleven
proposals were received and, following an extensive review, the Lenoir County site (Kinston Regional Jetport) was
identified as the preferred site. An Airport Master Plan was developed for the GPT which investigated several runway
layouts and a draft environmental assessment was prepared and coordinated with Federal and state environmental
agencies for their review and comments.



PUBLIC SCOPING:

 The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will hold a scoping meeting to solicit input
from Federal, state and local agencies which have jurisdiction by law or have specific expertise with respect to any
environmental impacts associated with the project. In addition, the public may submit written comments on the scope
of the environmental study to the address identified in 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 A Public Notice issued at a later date will provide the date, time and place of the scoping meeting and the period for
written comments.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 301&hyph;92]</RINDOCK>



Identification of Priority Foreign Country and Initiation of Section 302 Investigation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the identification of China as a priority foreign country pursuant to section 182(c) of the Trade Act of 1974,
as amended (Trade Act), the initiation of an investigation pursuant to section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade Act, and
request for public comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 182(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2242), the USTR has identified China as a priority foreign country
based on its failure to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights and fair and equitable
market access to persons relying on intellectual property protection. Pursuant to section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(2)(A)), the USTR has initiated an investigation of the acts, policies and practices that led
to the identification of China as a priority foreign country.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE: 

The USTR's identification of China and initiation of the related investigation took place on June 30, 1994.


</DATE>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Lee Sands, Deputy Assistant USTR for China and Mongolian Affairs (202) 395&hyph;5050, Deborah Lehr, Director for
China and Mongolian Affairs (202) 395&hyph;5050, or Thomas Robertson, Assistant General Counsel (202) 395&hyph;6800,
600 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20506.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 182(a) of the Trade Act requires the USTR annually to identify foreign countries that deny adequate and effective
protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights or that deny fair and equitable market access to persons
that rely on intellectual property protection. On April 30, 1994, the USTR identified China as being among the group
of 36 foreign countries that fall into this category. At that time, the USTR noted that China's failures in this regard
were particularly problematic, and that its status under special 301 would be reviewed again in 60 days. A U.S. government
interagency team traveled to China in June to seek elimination or modification of the acts, policies, and practices
of concern, but found little movement from the Chinese government on these issues.



Section 182(c) of the Trade Act permits the USTR at any time during the year to identify as priority foreign countries
those trading partners that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, and practices that have the greatest
adverse impact (actual or potential) on relevant U.S. products. Section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade Act requires the
initiation of an investigation of the acts, policies, and practices which were the basis for the priority foreign
country identification unless the acts, policies, and practices are already the subject of an investigation or action
under the section 301 provisions of the Trade Act.

Because of the severe problems with intellectual property protection and market access for persons that rely on intellectual
property protection in China, and the unwillingness of the Chinese government to address these problems through
productive consultations over the last 60 days, the USTR has designated China a priority foreign country and has initiated
an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of its acts, policies, and practices in this area.

While China has implemented most of its commitments under the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government
of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Intellectual
Property, it has failed to create an effective intellectual property rights enforcement regime. Copyright piracy
in China is particularly acute, and trademark infringement remains a serious concern, with little indication of
their willingness to address these problems. Appropriate implementation of China's new patent law and administrative
protection program for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals is also of concern. Particular problems with
China's present enforcement regime include, among other things, internally inconsistent laws; a lack of transparency
in the enforcement structure; a lack of protection for existing works; gaps in responsibility in the enforcement
structure; a lack of consistent application of the laws throughout the central, provincial and local governments;
a lack of funding, training and education; the absence of clear and effective criminal penalties; possible conflicts
of interest; burdensome and discriminatory agency requirements; overly-broad compulsory licensing provisions;
a failure of enforcement authorities to coordinate; and the absence of an effective border control mechanism.

China also fails to provide fair and equitable market access for persons who rely on intellectual property protection.
The most serious market access problems are found in the areas of audiovisual products, sound recordings, and published
written materials. Particular concerns include a hidden system of internal quotas, a lack of transparency, a lack
of consistency in application, monopoly control over the importation and distribution of products embodying intellectual
property, and a prohibition on the production or distribution of products embodying intellectual property that
is not related to the content of those products.

Pursuant to section 303(a) of the Trade Act, USTR has requested consultations with the Chinese government concerning
the issues under investigation. USTR will seek information and advice from the appropriate committees established
pursuant to section 135 of the Trade Act in preparing the U.S. presentations for such consultations. 

Within 6 months after the date on which this investigation was initiated (i.e., on or before December 30, 1994), pursuant
to section 304 of the Trade Act, the USTR must determine on the basis of the investigation and the consultations, whether
any act, policy or practice described in section 301 of the Trade Act exists and, if that determination is affirmative,
decide what action, if any, to take under section 301 of the Trade Act. The deadline for making those determinations
may be extended up to 9 months after the initiation of the investigation if the USTR determines that certain conditions
are met. 



Requirements for Submissions 



Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the acts, policies or practices of the Chinese government
that are the subject of this investigation, the amount of burden or restriction on U.S. commerce caused by these acts,
policies or practices, and the determinations required under section 304 of the Trade Act. 

Comments must be filed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 15 CFR 2006.8(b) and are due no later than 12
noon, Monday, August 8, 1994. Comments must be in English and provided in twenty copies to: Chairman, section 301 Committee,
Room 223, USTR, 600 17th St., NW., Washington, DC 20506. 

Comments will be placed in a file (Docket 301&hyph;92) open to public inspection pursuant to 15 CFR 2006.13, except
confidential business information exempt from public inspection in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15. Confidential
business information submitted in accordance with 15 CFR 2006.15 must be clearly marked ``Business Confidential''
in a contrasting color ink at the top of each page on each of the twenty copies, and must be accompanied by a nonconfidential
summary of the confidential information. The nonconfidential summary will be placed in the Docket open to public
inspection.
