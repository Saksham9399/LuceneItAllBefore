Full Disclosure of Beneficiary's Income and Assets




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Action is being taken to amend Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations to reflect changes in the law which
require certain fiduciaries of incompetent beneficiaries of veterans' benefits to report non-VA income in conjunction
with required formal or informal accountings. Under current regulation, fiduciaries recognized by VA are not required
to divulge non-VA income and assets that the fiduciary may be holding on behalf of incompetent VA beneficiaries. These
amendments will permit implementation of the law, allow for a greater degree of protection of the income and estates
of incompetent VA beneficiaries and reduce the incidence of waste, fraud and abuse of VA benefits by certain Federal
fiduciaries, and court-appointed fiduciaries.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments must be received on or before March 28, 1994. This amendment is proposed to be effective 30 days after the date
of publication of the final rule. Comments will be available for public inspection until April 6, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding the proposal to
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC 20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection at the above address only between
the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (except holidays) until April 6, 1994. Any person visiting Department
of Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, DC for the purpose of inspecting any such comments will be received
by the Central Office Veterans Services Unit in room 170. Such visitors to any VA field stations will be informed that
records are available for inspection only in Central Office and furnished the address and the above room number. A
copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management
and Budget at the address contained in the Paperwork Reduction section of this preamble.



</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Ronald Weaver, Program Analyst, Fiduciary and Equal Opportunity Staff, Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans
Benefits Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;2091.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 99&hyph;576, section 505 amended 38 U.S.C. 5502(b) (formerly 38 U.S.C. 3202(b)) to permit the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs to require a fiduciary to disclose, as part of the accounting process, any financial information
which is available to the fiduciary concerning the non-VA income and assets of an incompetent beneficiary of VA benefits.
The particular regulations to be amended deal specifically with the responsibilities of Federal fiduciaries and
court-appointed fiduciaries, and the authority of the Veterans Services Officers at VA Regional Offices to request
an accounting from a fiduciary. Each regulation would be amended to include the requirement that non-VA income and
assets be subject to inclusion in VA requested formal or informal accountings.



These changes will greatly enhance VA's ability to prevent waste, fraudulent use or abuse of the VA benefits of an incompetent
beneficiary by the VA recognized fiduciary. The changes will permit VA to formalize a procedure that has only been
informal and unenforceable in the past, namely the request for a total accounting of income and assets managed by a
fiduciary.


The Paperwork Reduction Act


These regulatory amendments contain new information collection requirements as VA will be requiring fiduciaries
to provide a type of information which we have not previously required. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork
Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request
that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments
for consideration by OMB on this proposed information collection requirement should address them to the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention:
Joseph F. Lackey.
The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulatory amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory
flexibility analyses requirements of &sect;&sect;603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that the additional
information fiduciaries are being asked to provide is that which they already have but have not previously provided,
requiring no additional data collection. In addition, the number of fiduciaries who will be reporting additional
income to comply with the proposed change is expected to be only 1% or approximately 300 of the approximately 30,000
fiduciaries who submit accountings.
There is no Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number.

Acid Rain Program: Permits and Allowance System Proposed Regulations; Change in Public Comment Period for the Proposed
Revisions to the Rules





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules; change in public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 18, 1993, EPA published proposed regulations revising 40 CFR parts 72 and 73, the Permits and Allowance
System rules of the Acid Rain Program. The original comment period for the proposal was to have ended January 3, 1994.
By notice published on December 30, 1993, EPA extended the public comment period to end on January 19, 1994. In response
to requests from interested parties, EPA is again extending the public comment period, which will end on February
10, 1994. In addition to the questions set forth in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA is requesting
that commenters address whether and, if so, under what circumstances allowances allocated by EPA to substitution
or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations would be given back to EPA at some future date.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Notice is hereby given that comments on the proposed revisions to the Permits and Allowance System rules published
November 18, 1993 in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60649&hyph;60968) must be submitted in writing and in duplicate to EPA by February 10, 1994.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA requested comment on whether certain substitution plans
and reduced utilization plans with compensating units should be approved, and allowances allocated to approved
substitution and compensating units, for 1995 under the January 11, 1993 regulations and whether action on these
compliance options for 1996&hyph;99 should be deferred pending completion of the instant rulemaking proceeding.
Comment was also requested concerning whether approval of these compliance options should be for some shorter or
longer period, with action on them for the remaining portion of Phase I being deferred.



In extending the public comment on this and other requests for comment set forth in the November 18, 1993 proposal,
EPA notes that interested parties have requested that the Agency seek additional comment concerning whether any
allowances allocated by EPA to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should
be returned to EPA at some future time. Consequently, EPA requests such comment. If commenters maintain that a return
of allowances should be required, the commenters should discuss what should be the period during which allowances
may be retained (e.g., how many years) and when that period should begin. For example, the allowances could be allocated
to a unit's Allowance Tracking System account for one or more years in Phase I and at the same time an equivalent number
of allowances could be deducted from the Allowance Tracking System account for one or more future years. As an alternative,
the deduction from the account for one or more future years could be made as the allowances are used or transferred.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Extension of Comment Period 



On November 22, 1993, EPA promulgated a proposed rule, 40 CFR 799.4450, that would require testing of five chemicals
for certain chemical fate, health and environmental effects under section 4(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA). The chemicals and their chemical-specific docket numbers are: acetophenone, 42150A/42151A; phenol, 42150A/42152A;
N,N- dimethylaniline, 42150A/42153A; ethyl acetate, 42150A/42141B; and 2,6-dimethylphenol, 42150A/42154A.
EPA has received requests from the Chemical Manufacturers Association for a 30&hyph;day extension of the comment
period and from the General Electric Company for a 90&hyph;day extension. EPA believes that providing an additional
30&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable, and EPA is extending the written comment period for
the proposed test rule until February 22, 1994. 



II. Corrections 



In addition, EPA is making the following corrections in the proposed rule: 

1. On page 61657, in Table 1, third column (``Guideline''), third entry from the bottom (opposite ``River die-away
testing'' in second column), change ``(incorporated by reference) ????'' to ``ASTM E&hyph;1279&hyph;89.'' 

2. On page 61659, third column, first full paragraph, which is headed ``3. Substantial human exposure finding,''
in the thirteenth line of the paragraph, change ``341,516'' to ``320,914''. 

3. On page 61670, in &sect;799.4450, second column, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A), delete the phrase ``and 2,6-dimethylphenol.''

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS has received a petition to list, either on an emergency basis or through normal listing procedures, coho salmon
(

Oncorhynchus kisutch

) throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, and to designate critical habitat under the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that
the request for a non-emergency listing may be warranted. Therefore, NMFS is initiating a status review to determine
if the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the review is comprehensive, NMFS is soliciting information
and data regarding this action. Information received during the comment period for this status review will be used
in NMFS' ongoing review of coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington (including Puget Sound).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Section 4 of the ESA contains provisions allowing interested persons to petition the Secretary of the Interior or
the Secretary of Commerce to add a species to or remove a species from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife
and to designate critical habitat. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1544) requires that, to the
maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving such a petition, the Secretary make a finding whether
the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action
may be warranted.


Petition Received


On October 20, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce received a petition from The Pacific Rivers Council (PRC) and 22 co-petitioners
to list, either on an emergency basis or through normal listing procedures, coho salmon throughout its range in Washington,
Oregon, Idaho, and California, and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The Assistant Administrator for
Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the existence of an emergency
posing a significant risk to the well-being of the species and, thus, the request for an emergency rule is denied. The
AA makes a finding that the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that a non-emergency
listing may be warranted based on the criteria specified in 50 CFR 424.14(b)(2), and based on evidence presented in
the petition that the petitioned populations may qualify as ``species'' under the ESA, in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy
on Applying the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act to Pacific Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November
20, 1991). Under section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA, this finding requires that a review of the status of coho salmon populations
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California be conducted to determine if the petitioned action is warranted. In
keeping with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the ESA, the Secretary will make his determination on the PRC 

et al. 

petition within 12 months of the date it was received (October 12, 1993). Information received during this status
review will be used in NMFS' ongoing review of coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington (58 FR
57770, October 27, 1993).

Listing Factors and Basis for Determination



Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following
reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization
for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. In addition,
under section 4(b)(7) of the ESA, the Secretary of Commerce may at any time issue an emergency regulation if there exists
a significant risk to the well-being of the species. In such a case, the Secretary must publish a Federal Register notice
detailing the reasons for an emergency listing. Listing determinations are made solely on the best scientific and
commercial data available.



Biological Information Solicited



To ensure that the coho salmon status review is complete and is based on the best available scientific and commercial
data, NMFS is soliciting information and comments concerning: (1) Whether or not the populations qualify as ``species''
under the ESA in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy on Applying the Definition of Species Under the Endangered Species
Act to Pacific Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991); and (2) whether or not the populations are endangered or threatened
based on the above listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information in the following areas: Influence
of historical and present hatchery fish releases on naturally spawning populations of coho salmon, separation of
hatchery and natural coho salmon escapement, alteration of coho salmon freshwater and marine habitats, disease
epizootiology of coho salmon, age structure of coho salmon populations, migration timing and behavior of juvenile
and adult coho salmon, and interactions of coho salmon with other salmonids. This information should address all
coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington (including Puget Sound). Because a very similar
request for information was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993) announcing NMFS' decision to conduct a review of West Coast coho salmon populations,
it is not necessary for parties to submit the same information for this request. Copies of the petition are available
(see 

ADDRESSES

).



Critical Habitat



NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for California, Oregon, Idaho,
and Washington populations of coho salmon. Areas that include the physical and biological features essential to
the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside the present range should also be identified if such
areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential features should include, but are not limited to: (1)
Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other
nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for reproduction and rearing of offspring;
and (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distributions of the species.

For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing: (1) The activities
that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional
requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation.

The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designation under the ESA is the probable economic impact
``of the [critical habitat] designation upon proposed or ongoing activities'' (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider
the incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects
attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section
7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the
ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that
can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitat.

Data, information, and comments should include: (1) Supporting documentation such as maps, bibliographic references,
or reprints of pertinent publications, and (2) the person's name, address, and association, institution, or business.
