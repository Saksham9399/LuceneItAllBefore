Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes




<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign
objects and debris, removal of any foreign object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard on the rear
cabin attendant seat. This proposal would also require a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program to include
repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal
of any foreign object or debris found. This proposal is prompted by reports that foreign objects and debris have been
found in the area around the elevator and rudder trim cables below the floor. The actions specified by the proposed
AD are intended to prevent foreign objects and debris from lodging in the control circuits and jamming the elevator
and rudder trim systems.

Discussion



The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received
reports that foreign objects and debris (in these cases, forks and crushed soft drink cans) have been found in the area
around the elevator and rudder trim cables below the floor. The foreign objects and debris passed through a vent via
a gap between the cushion and back of the rear cabin attendant seat. These foreign objects and debris can lodge in the
elevator and rudder trim control circuits. This condition, if not corrected, could result in jamming of the elevator
and rudder trim systems.


Jetstream has issued Series 4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A25&hyph;034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993,
that describes procedures for a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign objects and debris,
and removal of any foreign object or debris found. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for installation
of a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat. Installation of this guard will prevent any foreign object
or debris from passing through the floor vent. In addition, the alert service bulletin describes procedures for revising
regularly scheduled maintenance procedures to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective
guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. The CAA classified this service
bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 003&hyph;10&hyph;93 in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring
for foreign objects and debris, removal of any foreign object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard
on the rear cabin attendant seat. The proposed AD would also require a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program
to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and
removal of any foreign object or debris found. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the alert service bulletin described previously.

The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be supplied by the manfacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $770, or $110 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that
no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``ADDRESSES

Applicability: 

Model 4101 airplanes; constructors numbers 41004 through 41023 inclusive; certificated in any category.

with Jetstream Series 4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A25&hyph;034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993.

(1) Perform a visual inspection of the underfloor area for foreign objects and debris in accordance with the alert
service bulletin. Prior to further flight, remove any foreign object or debris found during the inspection.

(2) Install a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat in accordance with the alert service bulletin.

(b) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to require repetitive
visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign
object or debris found, in accordance with the times and procedures specified in paragraph 2.C.(7) of Jetstream Series
4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A25&hyph;034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993, as applicable.

(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, 
ANM&hyph;113.






Note:
