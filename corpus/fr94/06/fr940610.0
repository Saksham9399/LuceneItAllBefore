SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History



On November 1, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify
V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC)
facility and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. It also proposed to eliminate the exclusionary language regarding R&hyph;5002A,
R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308 (58 FR 58312). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Except for editorial changes and the correction to the Hartford 040
&cir; radial, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published
in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airway listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, VORTAC
and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. Realigning the airway will accommodate the airspace users, reduce ATC coordination,
and improve operations.

The airspace designation for V&hyph;229 presently excludes R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308.
These exclusions are being removed because the airspace boundaries of the restricted areas and the airways do not
overlap the airspace of V&hyph;229. In addition, the Hartford true and magnetic radials used to define an intersection
on V&hyph;229 were reversed. This action corrects the description to read ``INT Hartford 040
&cir;T(053
&cir;M).''

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

History



On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by modifying
the Class D airspace for Tri-Cities Airport, Pasco, Washington (59 FR 15668). Airspace within a .9-mile radius of
Vista Field Airport is presently excluded from the Pasco Class D airspace. Recent construction at the Vista Field
airport has resulted in closure of the east-west runway, requiring aircraft operating to runway 02/20 to fly over
the Columbia River outside the present airspace exclusion. Interested parties were invited to participate in the
rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Pasco, Washington by excluding
additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport Kennewick, Washington. The FAA has determined that this regulation
only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary
to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Request for Comments on the Rule




Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments, and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it
will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's
hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed
at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the
term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The
former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action
is to clarify when two-way radio communication with this air traffic control tower is required.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraphs 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate
need to modify this Class D airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in this area.
Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public
interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

History 



On July 26, 1993, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 71) to update certain control zones and transition areas in the New England Region (58 FR 39693). That NPRM
was prompted by a region-wide review of control zones and transition areas for conformity with the United States Standards
for Terminal Procedures (TERPS). That review revealed a need to make revisions to many of those airspace areas in the
New England region. 

After publication of that NPRM, all airspace areas in the United States were reclassified according to the standards
adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). (See, Airspace Reclassification final rule,
56 FR 65638.) Airspace Reclassification, effective on September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``control
zone'' and ``transition area,'' and reclassified those areas respectively as either Class D or Class E airspace.


The FAA published the final rule to revise airspace areas in the vicinity of airports in the New England region on March
11, 1994 (59 FR 11535). That final rule contained airspace descriptions of the former ``control zones'' and ``transition
areas'' translated into Class D and Class E classifications. 



The Amendment 



The final rule, however, contained minor errors introduced during the process of translating the descriptions into
Class D and Class E classifications. Specifically, three airspace areas with no operating airport traffic control
tower (ATCT) were listed Class D instead of Class E; Augusta, ME, Houlton, ME and Presque Isle, ME. One area was listed
as Class D instead of as a Class E extension to a Class D area; Brunswick, ME. Two Class E areas, listed as extensions to
Class D areas, require correction because of the changes made to those Class D areas; Hartford, CT, Portsmouth, NH.


In addition, this action makes three general revisions to the descriptions of certain airspace areas, which delete
language introduced into the descriptions during the translation process. Some descriptions of former transition
areas, now Class E airspace, contained language that excluded from those areas airspace defined as higher class airspace.
This language is no longer needed because of the general rule of airspace classification under the ICAO standards
that higher class airspace always takes precedence. Further, when modified to fit the new airspace classifications
and to meet the TERPS requirements, certain descriptions no longer used some airway facilities, therefore, the definition
and location of those unused facilities is no longer needed in the airspace description. Lastly, this action corrects
the description of Class E airspace defined as extensions to higher class airspace by deleting altitude limits, not
needed because of the general rule that Class E airspace extends upward to the base of the overlying airspace. Finally,
this action makes minor typographical changes. 

This document reprints the entire airspace description for those areas needing correction. This action is necessary
to correct errors in the descriptions of certain Class D and Class E airspace areas in the New England region. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action clarifies the existing rule and does not place any new restriction or requirements on the public. Furthermore,
the FAA finds that this amendment does not involve a change in the dimensions or operating requirements of the airspace
listings incorporated by reference in part 71. These errors are insignificant in nature and impact and inconsequential
to the industry and public. Therefore, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Additionally,
in consideration of the immediate need to advise pilots of the corrections to the classification and description
of certain airspace areas, the FAA finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days in order to promote the safe operation of aircraft in this area.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA. A Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)/Distance
Measuring Equipment (DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the South Lake Tahoe
Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach.
The establishment of Class E airspace will provide adequate airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
at South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for
pilots operating in the area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
a Class E Airspace area at South Lake Tahoe, CA. (59 FR 14804). An SIAP was being developed for the South Lake Tahoe Municipal
Airport at South Lake Tahoe, CA. This will add controlled airspace extending from the surface for IFR operations at
South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings
by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal.
The coordinates in the proposal were based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from the surface designated as an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph
6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in this Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA.
This action will provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the LDA/DME&hyph;1/2 approaches
at South Lake Tahoe, CA.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

On April 11, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Idaho Falls, Idaho, Class E airspace (59 FR 17055). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking
proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.

Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are now Class
E airspace areas. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or more above the surface of
the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed
in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Idaho Falls, Idaho. This
action is necessary to accommodate an amendment to an instrument approach procedure for the Fanning Field Airport,
Idaho Falls, Idaho.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to modify Class E airspace at Warroad International-Swede
Carlson Field, Warroad, MN, to accommodate Instrument Landing System (ILS) Runway 31, and Nondirectional Beacon
(NDB) Runway 31 Standard Instrument Approach (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed
to contain aircraft executing the approach.

Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

History


On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to provide additional
airspace to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal areas in southeastern
Oregon (59 FR 15670). Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the
term ``transition area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the
earth are now Class E airspace areas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested
parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal.
No comments were received. This action is the same as the proposal except for a typographical error discovered and
corrected herein in the coordinates for La Grande/Union County Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket
are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at La Grande, Oregon. The FAA has
determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

History


On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
the Cascade Range, Washington, Class E airspace area (59 FR 15671). This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure
aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal area east of Seattle, Washington. The area will be depicted
on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding
by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. This action is the same as the proposal
except for a typographical error discovered and offered herein in the coordinates of the airspace description. The
coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph
6006 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations established Class E airspace at Cascade Range, Washington.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65514), FDA published an interim rule on human tissue intended for transplantation. This
interim rule requires certain infectious disease testing, donor screening, and recordkeeping to help prevent the
transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis through human tissue used in transplantation.
The regulations set forth in the interim rule became effective upon publication. Interested persons were given until
March 14, 1994, to comment on the interim rule. 


The objective of this public workshop is to discuss practical concerns expressed in received public comments relating
to the implementation of the interim rule. The following topics will be discussed: 
1. Experience with the interim rule; 
2. Management of testing relative to hemodilution; 
3. Experience with test kit performance on cadaveric blood samples; and 4. Management of current inventories in regard
to testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).


Discussion of these topics will be considered by FDA in the development of any future rulemaking. 


FDA is reopening the comment period to the interim rule so that interested persons may submit comments on the workshop.
Persons who wish to provide additional materials for consideration should file these materials with the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). 
Interested persons may, on or before August 20, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), written
comments regarding this document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On July 22, 1993, the Department published a major revision to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
(58 FR 39280). After several months of implementation and various training seminars with other government agencies
and with industry, several issues have been identified which merit regulatory or procedural changes. This final
rule is being published to address three (3) of the issues. Section 123.16(a) is revised to exclude significant military
equipment from the exemption stated in &sect;123.16. This change was deemed necessary in order to ensure compliance
with the Department's congressional notification requirements and the ITAR requirement for nontransfer and use
certification for defense articles which are defined in part 120 of the ITAR as ``significant military equipment''.
In addition, &sect;124.10 is amended by removing the requirement that a signed DSP&hyph;83 be submitted with proposed
agreements. Compliance with this requirement has proven to be difficult, and of insufficient benefit to the Department
to merit continuation of the requirement. Finally, &sect;126.5 is amended by deleting the exception to the Canadian
exemption which requires a license for the export to Canada of unclassified technical data directly related to a classified
defense article.



The Department of State views these changes as beneficial for U.S. persons and industry and has decided to implement
them immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed.

This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under E.O. 12866
and has been reviewed internally by the Department of State to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It is
also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Summary of State Submittal



On July 21, 1993, the Indiana Pollution Control Board adopted and on January 6, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) formally submitted to the USEPA a request to approve the July 21, 1993, adopted emission statement
regulations, codified as 326 IAC 2&hyph;6. This submission addresses the emission statement requirements which
are found in section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended (1990 Amendments).

Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act states that, within 2 years after the enactment of the Act, states with ozone nonattainment
areas (classified as marginal or worse) must submit revisions to their SIPs to require the owners or operators of stationary
sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) or Oxides of Nitrogen (NO

X

) to provide the states with statements, in a form acceptable to the USEPA, showing actual emissions of NO

X

 and/or VOC from the sources. The first emission statements must be submitted within 3 years of the enactment of the
Act. Subsequent statements are to be submitted annually thereafter. These statements must contain certifications
of accuracy. 
Section 182(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that the states may waive the requirements for emission statements
for any class or category of sources which emit less than 25 tons per year if the states, through the submission of base
year emission inventories or periodic emission inventories (required to be submitted to the USEPA every three years),
provide for the reporting of the emissions from the exempted source classes or categories and emissions are determined
using emission factors acceptable to the USEPA.



II. Analysis of State Submittal



The criteria used to review the submitted SIP revisions are found in USEPA's draft Guidance on the Implementation
of an Emission Statement Program, (July 1992). It should be noted that this guideline has not been finalized, but does
provide current USEPA guidance on the contents of emission statements and on the states' use of emission statements.
For this reason, the July 1992 draft guidance has been used for the technical review of this submission. It should be
noted that the USEPA intends to incorporate the guidelines contained in the July 1992 guidance into the Code of Federal
Regulations in the near future.

The July 1992 guidance describes the following requirements for emission statement SIP revisions:

1. Regardless of what minimum emission reporting level is established, if either VOC or NO

X

 is emitted at or above the established minimum reporting level, the emissions of both VOC and NO

X

 should be reported;

2. The emission statements should, at minimum, include the following data:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-0-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. Certification of data accuracy; to be made by an officer of the reporting company who will take legal responsibility
for the accuracy of the reported data;

b. Source identification information;

c. Operating schedules;

d. Emissions information, including both annual and typical ozone season daily emissions;

e. Control equipment information; and

f. Process data.

3. States must incorporate the emission statement data into an annual point source emissions submittal to the USEPA.
This annual emissions submittal is first due to the USEPA by July 1, 1993;

4. In addition to the submittal of emission statements and the annual point source emissions report, the USEPA is also
requesting that states submit an Emissions Statement Status Report (ESSR) beginning by July 1, 1993. The ESSR is to
be submitted quarterly each year until all applicable sources have submitted emission statements. The ESSR should
individually list the source facilities that are delinquent in submitting emission statements. The ESSR should
also include the total annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all source facilities submitting emission
statements prior to the ESSR submittal;

5. States are required to use the data collected through the emission statement program to annually update the facility-specific
data contained in the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) by July 1st of each year; and



6. States must commit to retain emission statement data and submittals for a period of at least three years.

Indiana's submittal contains the adopted regulations that will apply to source facilities and that specify what
data are to be submitted. The remainder of this technical review will be dedicated to reviewing the contents and technical
merits of the state's adopted regulations and the accompanying state commitments.

As noted above, the emission statement regulations are codified as 326 IAC 2&hyph;6. The provisions of the regulations
are outlined as follows:



Applicability



The emission statement regulations are applicable to all sources of VOC or NO

X

 with the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of VOC or NO

X

 in the Counties of: Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh. The regulations are
also applicable to sources of Carbon Monoxide (CO), VOC, NO

X

, Particulate Matter (PM), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO

2

) which have the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more and to sources of Lead (Pb) which have the potential to emit
5 tons per year or more in the State of Indiana. If the emissions from a facility surpass the emission cutoff for any of
these pollutants, the emissions of all the named pollutants must be addressed in the submitted emission statement.



Definitions



The definitions in 326 IAC 2&hyph;6 applicable to the emission statement regulations and of greatest relevance to
the emission statement regulations are summarized here.



Actual emissions

 means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions unit for the calendar year or seasonal period.



Annual process rate

 means the actual or estimated annual fuel, process, or solid waste operating rate in an emission statement operating
year.



Certifying individual

 means the individual responsible for the completion and certification of the emission statement, such as an officer
of the company or an employee, who will take legal responsibility for the accuracy of the emission statement.



Control efficiency

 means the actual emission control efficiency achieved by the applicable emission control device(s) during the emission
statement operating year. The control efficiency must reflect control equipment downtime, operation with diminished
effectiveness, and any other malfunctions that occurred while the emission source(s) were in operation. If the actual
control efficiency during the emission statement operating year is unknown or cannot reasonably be predicted from
available data, then the efficiency designed by the manufacturer may be used. When the actual control efficiency
is unknown, it should be clearly indicated that the design efficiency, and not the actual efficiency, is being reported.



Control equipment identification code

 means the AIRS or AIRS Facility Subsystem (AFS) code which defines the equipment used to reduce by destruction or removal
the amount of air pollutant in an air stream prior to discharge to the ambient air.



Downtime

 means the period of time when the control device is not operational during the corresponding period of the process.



Emission factor

 means an estimate of the rate at which a pollutant is released to the atmosphere as the result of some activity, divided
by the rate of that activity, such as production rate or throughput.



Emission statement operating year

 means the 12 consecutive month time period starting December 1 and ending November 30 for those sources located in
Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, or Vanderburgh Counties with the potential to emit VOC or
NO

X

 into the ambient air at levels equal to or greater than 10 tons per year, or the 12 consecutive month time period starting
January 1 and ending December 31 for all other sources to which the emission statement regulations apply (see the discussion
of applicability above).



Estimated emissions method code

 means a one position (one character) AIRS or AFS code which identifies the estimation technique used in the calculation
of estimated emissions.



Fugitive emission

 means releases to the air that are not emitted through stacks, vents, ducts, pipes, or any other confined air stream.
Fugitive emissions include equipment leaks, evaporative losses from surface impoundments, and releases from building
ventilation systems.



Peak ozone season

 means the contiguous three-month period of the year from June through August.



Percentage annual throughput

 means:

1. The weighted percent of yearly activity for those sources located in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter,
St. Joseph, or Vanderburgh Counties with the potential to emit VOC or NO

X

 into the ambient air at levels equal to or greater than 10 tons per year and for the following periods:

a. December through February;

b. March through May;

c. June through August; and

d. September through November.

2. The weighted percent of yearly activity for all other sources to which the emission statement regulations apply
for the following periods:

Plant 

means the total facilities available for production or service. 


Point 

means a physical emission point or process, such as a distinct 
building or a portion of a building, within a plant that results in pollutant 
emissions. 


Process rate

 means a quantity per unit of time of any raw material or 
process intermediate consumed, or product generated through the use of any 
equipment, source operation, or process. For a stationary internal combustion 
unit or any other fuel burning equipment, this term means the quantity of fuel 
burned per unit time.

In addition to the requirements of the emission statement regulations, 
the emission statement SIP revision submittal also contains IDEM commitments 
to the following: 
1. IDEM will update the AIRS facility subsystem using the annual 
emissions report data. The data required by the Act will be entered 
into AIRS by July 1st each year. The data required by 40 CFR part 51 
will be updated into AIRS by September 1 of each year. 
2. IDEM will retain the annual emission reports on file for at least 
3 years. 
3. IDEM will develop and submit to the USEPA a status report that 
outlines the degree of compliance with the emission statement program. IDEM 
will report quarterly to the USEPA, the total number of sources affected by 
the emission statement regulations, the number of sources that have complied 
with the emission statement regulations, and the number of sources that have 
not. The status report will also include the total annual and typical ozone 
season day emissions from all reporting VOC and NO

X

 sources located 
in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh Counties, both corrected and non-corrected
for rule effectiveness. Sources 
that are delinquent in submitting their emission statements will be 
individually listed if they emit 500 tons per year or more of VOC or 2,500 
tons per year or more of NO

X

. The quarterly status reports will be submitted 
July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1 of each year. 


III. Final Action 


IDEM's adopted annual emissions reporting 
regulations submitted on January 6, 1994, are acceptable under section 
182(a)(3)(B) of the Act and USEPA's draft guidelines. 
Because USEPA considers today's action noncontroversial and routine, 
we are approving it today without prior proposal. The action will become 
effective on August 9, 1994. However, if we receive notice by July 11, 1994 that someone wishes to submit 
adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the 
action; and (2) a document that begins a new action by proposing the action 
and establishing a comment period.

<TEXT>
 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does 
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the
USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing
a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for
the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed,
and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6608), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Delaware. The
NPR proposed approval of the addition of section 36 and appendix J to Regulation No. 24, Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations,
into Delaware's ozone SIP. Delaware formally submitted section 36 and appendix J of Regulation No. 24 to EPA as a SIP
revision on January 11, 1993, to comply with the Stage II vapor recovery requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act.
 


This rulemaking action is approving the addition of section 36 and appendix J into the Delaware ozone SIP. Section
36 and appendix J requires Stage II vapor recovery at gasoline dispensing facilities which dispense 10,000 gallons
per month (gpm) or more. Further discussion of the applicability of this regulation, as well as the compliance schedule
for Delaware's three counties are outlined in the NPR.
 

Other specific requirements of the Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities and the
rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were
received on the NPR.





Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision to add Section 36&hyph;Stage II Vapor Recovery and Appendix J, 

Procedures for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing
Facilities

 to Regulation No. 24, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions'' submitted by the State of Delaware on January
11, 1993. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

This action had been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memo, the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse
comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning
this action, therefore, under the new guidelines this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January
6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of
section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for
Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This
request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30,
1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this approval of Stage II Vapor Recovery
Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities in the State of Delaware must be filed in the United States Court of
Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65309), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland.
The NPR proposed approval of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State of Maryland. A formal SIP revision was submitted
by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992. 





Specific requirements of the Oxygenated Gasoline Program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained
in the NPR and will not be restated here. No comments were received on the NPR.



Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992, which implements an Oxygenated
Gasoline Program in the State. The SIP revision consists of revisions to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 03.03.05,
and COMAR 26.11.13 and new regulations codified at COMAR 03.03.06 and COMAR 26.11.20. Nothing in this action should
be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state
implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.

This action was originally classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under
the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memorandum, the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse
comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning
this action; therefore, under the new guidelines, this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January
6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of
section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request.
This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. 


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve Maryland's Oxygenated
Gasoline Program must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994.
Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this
rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may
be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)

Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Those regulations cite the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits,'' published by the International Chamber of Commerce. This notice inserts the words ``and copyrighted''
into the letter of credit instrument to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted
material. As a result of this notice, owners and operators using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial
assurance must include this additional language.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Authority 


This amendment is promulgated under the authority of Sections 2002(a), 3004, 3005, and 3006 of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6924, 6925, 6926, and 6991, and under the authority of the Safe Drinking
Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq. 



II. Background 


Owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must demonstrate financial
assurance for costs of closure, post-closure care, third-party liability and corrective action associated with
their facilities. In subpart H of 40 CFR part 264, the Agency has established regulations regarding financial assurance
for closure, post-closure care, and third party liability. Section 264.151 provides wording for the various financial
instruments that owners and operators may use to demonstrate financial assurance. Section 264.151(d) provides
wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure care, and &sect;264.151(k)
provides wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for third-party liability. 

The RCRA regulations in 40 CFR part 280 impose similar requirements on owners and operators of underground storage
tanks. Under those provisions, owners and operators of underground storage tanks must demonstrate financial assurance
for taking corrective action and for third party liability. The regulations then establish a series of mechanisms
that owners and operators can use. Section 280.99 provides the wording for a letter of credit, which is one of those
allowable mechanisms. 

Finally, the regulations at 40 CFR part 144, subpart F for the Underground Injection Control Program contain specific
requirements for financial responsibility for Class I hazardous waste injection wells. Class I wells inject industrial
and municipal wastes, including RCRA hazardous wastes, below the lowermost underground source of drinking water
(USDW). 40 CFR part 144, subpart F, is directly applicable to owners and operators of all Class I hazardous waste injection
wells. 


III. Purpose of This Notice 


The wording of the letter of credit instrument in &sect;&sect;144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and &sect;280.99 includes
a reference to the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,'' published by the International Chamber
of Commerce. However, the language does not make it clear that the International Chamber of Commerce publication
is copyrighted material. 

This correction notice amends the letter of credit instrument in &sect;&sect;144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and
280.99 to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material by including the
words ``and copyrighted'' in the wording of the letter of credit instrument. As a result of this change to the regulations,
owners and operators who obtain a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance must use the revised language
in &sect;264.151(d), 264.151(k), or 280.99(b), which includes the words ``and copyrighted.'' 



IV. Effect on State Authority To Administer Federal Programs 


Since this amendment only revises the description of the document, and does not impose new duties on owners or operators
that choose to rely on letters of credit, EPA will not require states to adopt this change as part of their approved UIC
and UST programs or authorized RCRA programs. Therefore, owners and operators in authorized states that do not adopt
this change will not be affected by this rule. However, EPA encourages states to adopt this change. 

In states that adopt this change and in states without approved UIC or UST programs or states not authorized for the
RCRA program, new letter of credit instruments will have to include this new language. 



V. Administrative Procedures Act Requirements 


Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), a rule is exempt from notice and public comment requirements ``when the agency for good
cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issues) that notice
and public procedures thereon are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' EPA believes
that comment is unnecessary because this amendment makes only a change in the wording of the letter of credit instrument,
but does not change the requirements for using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial assurance.
Therefore, EPA believes there is good cause to make today's rule effective on August 9, 1994.

Reversion of Domestic Preference to Buy American Act



Subpart 1825.71 and clauses at 1852.225&hyph;74 and 1852.225&hyph;75 are removed because an appropriation act
requirement for domestic preference was not extended beyond Fiscal Year 1991 funding. The domestic preference required
by the Buy American Act, as implemented in (FAR) 48 CFR Subparts 25.1 and 25.2 and (NASA FAR Supplement) 48 CFR Subparts
1825.1 and 1825.2, remains in effect.

Section 1815.805&hyph;5(b) is revised in order to complete an incomplete sentence. Section 1815.970&hyph;3(b)
is revised in order to correct a cross-reference. A reference is corrected in 1822.870 regarding contractor EEO reports.
A reference to Code FO is changed to Code UO and the division title is changed (section 1823.7002(c)). Section 1852.209&hyph;71
is revised in order to correct two cross-references. In addition, section references and subpart headings are revised
to reflect corresponding changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.



Impact



NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule sets forth the policies for using performance-based contracting techniques and addressing this issue
as an item in procurement plans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background


The regulation was developed to implement OMB's request that NASA make greater use of performance-based contracting
techniques. It holds requiring activities responsible for stating specifications, purchase descriptions, and
statements of work, on the basis of performance, where practical, so that a variety of products or services may apply.
The regulation also ensures that contract files include a statement on consideration or use of performance-based
contracting techniques.

Executive Order 12866



The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed because greater use of performance-based contracting techniques will give contractors more
freedom to innovate and economize, and also hold them more accountable for the end results. The regulation meets that
need by requiring performance-based specifications, purchase descriptions and statements of work, where feasible,
to (i) describe the work in terms of the required output; (ii) place full responsibility for quality performance on
contractors with formal, measurable performance standards and surveillance plans used to assess contractor performance;
and (iii) avoid relying on cumbersome and intrusive process-oriented inspection and oversight programs to assess
contractor performance.



The potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action are supported by OFPP Policy Letter 91&hyph;2, Service
Contracting. The regulation is NASA's internal implementation of OFPP Policy Letter 91&hyph;2. NASA has benefited
using performance-oriented launch service contracts that balance the assignment of positive and negative performance
incentives with a meaningful system of financial rewards and penalties. The statements of work are broad in scope
and general in nature, focusing on the successful delivery of the undamaged and operational spacecraft to the proper
trajectory and orbital conditions without violating mission parameters. Some of these contracts provide for (i)
mission success pools that incentivize the contractor to deliver payload safely and into correct orbit and (ii) liquidated
damages relative to timely and effective performance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 


In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the Central Aleutian District was established
by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish for the BSAI (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric
tons (mt). 
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8),
that the Atka mackerel TAC specified for the Central Aleutian District soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional
Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 37,346 mt after determining that 500 mt will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in the Central Aleutian District. The Regional Director has determined
that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka
mackerel in the Central Aleutian District, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t.,
December 31, 1994. 
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;675.20(h).

Paperwork Reduction Act


The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of
Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1343.
The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 30 minutes to one hour, depending on individual circumstances,
with an estimated average of 45 minutes.
Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent
to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office
of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.


Background


On November 2, 1992, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register 

proposed amendments to the income tax regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 170, 642, 664, and 7520 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code), and to the estate and gift tax regulations (26 CFR part 20 and part 25) under sections 2031, 2512,
and 7520 of the Code. Conforming changes were proposed for regulations under other sections of the Code. On February
3, 1993, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register

 certain corrections to the proposed regulations. This project finalizes those amendments. Written comments responding
to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were received. No public hearing was requested, and none was held. After consideration
of all of the comments received regarding the proposed regulations, those amendments are adopted by this Treasury
decision with revisions in response to those comments. A summary of the principal comments received and revisions
made in the final regulations in response to those comments is provided below.


Explanation of Provisions


The notice of proposed rulemaking included estate tax regulations that described the implementation of the new valuation
standard, including an explanation of the general effective date of May 1, 1989 (&sect;20.7520&hyph;1), an explanation
of the special elections for charitable interests (&sect;20.7520&hyph;2), a listing of Code provisions that are
not subject to section 7520 (&sect;20.7520&hyph;3), and a description of transitional rules for income, estate,
and gift tax valuations (&sect;20.7520&hyph;4). In the final regulations, the substance of &sect;&sect;20.7520&hyph;1
through 20.7520&hyph;4 has been incorporated into analogous provisions for the Income Tax Regulations (&sect;&sect;1.7520&hyph;1
through 1.7520&hyph;4) and the Gift Tax Regulations (&sect;&sect;25.7520&hyph;1 through 25.7520&hyph;4).

In response to comments, several editorial changes were made to clarify certain of the formulas contained in the proposed
regulations. These clarifications principally involve the insertion of additional parentheses or brackets in
order to make the formulas easier for the reader to understand and apply.
Also in response to comments, &sect;1.170A&hyph;12(b) was updated in a correction to the proposed regulations that
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 3, 1993. The update includes a formula for the computation of the special factor to value a remainder interest
following one life where the property is subject to exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence. A similar formula
in &sect;1.170A&hyph;12(e), which is applicable to the valuation of a remainder interest following two lives, was
also updated. The change in formulas avoids the need to include lengthy commutation factor tables in the regulations.
Clarifying amendments have been made in the final regulations concerning the meaning of ``valuation date'' for purposes
of an election to value a transfer to a charitable remainder trust. In the case of an election under section 7520 to compute
the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding
the month in which the transfer is made, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest
rate and mortality tables. Sections 1.664&hyph;2(c) and 1.664&hyph;4(e)(4) of the final regulations have been
revised accordingly.
Comments were received pertaining to the rule in the proposed regulations under section 7520 concerning the transfer
of more than one partial interest in the same property at different times. In response to these comments, the regulations
have been amended to make it clear that, generally, each separate transfer is valued with the interest rate applicable
in the month of the transfer.
The proposed regulations provide for making the election to use a prior month's interest rate in the case of a transfer
to charity. Comments questioned the need for requiring the filing of detailed information as part of a prior-month
election. This information is already required to be filed with the tax return for certain situations involving charitable
interests that are subject to measuring lives. See, for example, &sect;20.2055&hyph;2(f)(5). This requirement
is now explained in the regulations under section 7520. Comments also raised a question about the revocability of
the election and the time for making the election. The final regulations provide that the taxpayer makes the prior-month
election by so stating on the return and identifying the elected month. The failure to include with the return other
information that is required to describe the transfer, whether or not the election is made, will ordinarily not invalidate
the election. For elections made on or before June 10, 1994, a reasonable attempt to make the election and submit the
required information will be treated as a valid election. The final regulations also provide that the election is
generally made on a timely filed tax return for the year of the transfer. However, the election may also be made or changed
on an amended or supplemented return that is made within 24 months after the original return is filed.
Comments were received concerning whether the five percent de minimis test (i.e., a transfer to charity of at least
five percent of the value of the interest) set forth in the proposed regulations should be applied in determining if
the taxpayer may elect to use an alternative prior month interest rate. The final regulations delete this de minimis
test.
Comments were received concerning the application of these regulations in situations where an individual is expected
to die prematurely or where two individuals die simultaneously. See, for example, Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80, 1980&hyph;1
C.B. 194, which holds that, in cases where the individual's death is imminent, the standard actuarial tables prescribed
by the regulations are not to be used. See, also, 

Carter 

v. 

United States,

 291 F.2d 63 (5th Cir. 1991), where the court refused to ascribe value to an income interest for purposes of the section
2013 credit where the death of the transferee was simultaneous with the death of the transferor. Comments were also
received concerning the scope of these regulations in light of 

O'Reilly 

v. 

Commissioner,

 973 F.2d 1403 (8th. Cir. 1992), 

rem'd, 

T.C.M. 1994&hyph;61. In 

O'Reilly, 

the Circuit Court held that the standard actuarial tables were not applicable to a situation in which the application
of those tables would have produced an unreasonable result. In that case, the property held in trust produced an extraordinarily
low rate of return. A similar result was reached by the Tax Court in 

Froh 

v.

 Commissioner, 

100 T.C. 1 (1993), dealing with depletable property. Consistent with these comments, the Service and Treasury are
contemporaneously proposing an amendment to these regulations that defines the circumstances in which the section
7520 tables would not apply in valuing a transferred interest. That Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.

Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, announced a method for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for
new pooled income funds. This method defined the deemed rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate
for the preceding three years, reduced by one percentage point. The proposed regulations would have defined the deemed
rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate for the preceding three years, multiplied by 90 percent.
Both methods produced the same result for each of the years after the enactment of section 7520:

Commentators have indicated a strong preference for the method announced in Notice 89&hyph;60, because they view
the computation as simpler than that set forth in the proposed regulations. In response to these comments, the final
regulations adopt the method described in Notice 89&hyph;60 for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for
new pooled income funds.

Comments were received concerning whether, in valuing transfers to a new pooled income fund, the same deemed rate
of return would be used throughout the entire three-year period. The final regulations provide that the deemed rate
of return for transfers to a new pooled income fund is recomputed each calendar year using the monthly section 7520
rates for the three-year period immediately preceding the calendar year in which each transfer to the fund is made
until the fund has been in existence for three taxable years and can compute its highest rate of return for the three
taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made.

A commentator suggested that, with respect to the interpolation method for valuing transfers to pooled income funds
and charitable remainder unitrusts, a taxpayer be permitted to elect a more exact method of computing the appropriate
interest rate. The method prescribed in the proposed regulations has been in use for many years and is prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service in Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89) and Internal
Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial Values, Beta Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). The IRS and Treasury believe
that any change from the method prescribed in these publications, which are in current use, would create undue confusion
for taxpayers. Consequently, the commentator's suggested change is not being adopted at this time.

Comments were received inquiring about the application of section 7520 to the valuation of annuities issued by certain
organizations other than insurance companies. In response to these comments, the final regulations explain that
the section 7520 tables are to be used in valuing these annuities. This is an application of the principle adopted in
Rev. Rul. 84&hyph;162, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 200, for transfers after November 23, 1984. A different method of valuation
continues to apply for purposes of computing the exclusion ratio in reporting the annuity payments under section
72. These clarifications have been made by updating &sect;1.101&hyph;2(e)(1)(iii)(

b

) and 

Example 8

 of &sect;1.1011&hyph;2(c).
Comments were received concerning the presumption in the proposed regulations under section 664 that, if a governing
instrument for a charitable remainder unitrust does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period,
the distribution is presumed to be made on the first day of the period. Unitrusts have traditionally been regarded
as providing for distributions at the beginning of each period unless the governing instrument provides to the contrary.
This presumption has been reflected in unitrust factors prescribed in the regulations under section 664 since the
enactment of that section. Therefore, the presumption that distributions are made on the first day of the period,
if not otherwise provided for in the instrument, is continued in the final regulations.

Effective Dates



These regulations are generally effective in the case of annuities, interests for life or terms of years, and remainder
or reversionary interests created after April 30, 1989. The regulations provide certain transitional rules intended
to alleviate any adverse consequences resulting from the statutory amendments. Several principal provisions of
the regulations were announced in Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660 (which announced the change from the 10
percent fixed rate of interest to the section 7520 floating rate of interest), and Notice 89&hyph;60 (which announced
the change in mortality tables) (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of the Statement of Procedural Rules). A transitional rule in the final regulations provides that, for valuation
dates of transfers after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24 or Notice
89&hyph;60 in valuing the transferred interest. For gift tax purposes, a transitional rule in the final regulations
provides that if, after December 31, 1988, but before May 1, 1989, a donor transferred an interest in property, retaining
an interest in the same property, and the donor later transferred the retained interest in the property after April
30, 1989, and before January 1, 1990, the donor may elect to value the transfer of the retained interest under either
the 10 percent tables or the section 7520 tables (whichever is more beneficial). For estate tax purposes, a transitional
rule in the final regulations provides that the estate of a mentally incompetent decedent may elect to value the property
interest included in the gross estate under the mortality table and interest rate in effect at the time the decedent
became mentally incompetent or the mortality table and interest rate in effect on the decedent's date of death if the
decedent was under a mental incapacity that existed on May 1, 1989, and continued uninterrupted until the decedent's
death. For purposes of determining the value of the remainder interest in a testamentary charitable remainder unitrust
or annuity trust, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that the mortality table and 10 percent interest
rate in effect before May 1, 1989, or the mortality table and interest rate under section 7520 may be used if the decedent
was mentally incompetent on May 1, 1989, and (1) such incompetency continued uninterrupted until death, or (2) the
decedent died within 90 days of first regaining competency after April 30, 1989.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is William L. Blodgett, Office of Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special
Industries), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

election is made under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2 of this chapter 
to compute the present value of the interest transferred by use 
of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months 
preceding the month in which the interest is transferred.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* 
(b) 

Valuation of a remainder interest following only one 
life

_(1) 

General rule.

 The value of a remainder interest in 
real property following only one life is determined under the 
rules provided in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7 (or for certain prior periods, 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations), using the 
interest rate and life contingencies prescribed for the date of 
the gift. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to 
the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). 
However, if any part of the real property is subject to 
exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence, the special factor 
determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be used 
in valuing the remainder interest in that part. Further, if any 
part of the property is subject to depletion of its natural 
resources, such depletion is taken into account in determining 
the value of the remainder interest. 
(2) 

Computation of depreciation factor.

 If the valuation of 
the remainder interest in depreciable property is dependent upon 
the continuation of one life, a special factor must be used. The 
factor determined under this paragraph (b)(2) is carried to the 
fifth decimal place. The special factor is to be computed on the 
basis of the interest rate and life contingencies prescribed in 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7 (or for certain prior periods, &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this 
chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) and on the assumption that the 
property depreciates on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life. For transfers for which the valuation date is after 
April 30, 1989, special factors for determining the present value 
of a remainder interest following one life and an example 
describing the computation are contained in Internal Revenue 
Service Publication 1459, ``Actuarial Values, Gamma Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). This publication is no longer available
for purchase from 
the Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be obtained by 
requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 1459), 
room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin 
Station, Washington, DC 20044. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) 
(relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under 
certain circumstances). Otherwise, in the case of the valuation 
of a remainder interest following one life, the special factor 
may be obtained through use of the following formula:

Where:




n=the estimated number of years of useful life,
i=the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code,
v=1 divided by the sum of 1 plus the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code,
x=the age of the life tenant, and
lx=number of persons living at age x as set forth in Table 80CNSMT of &sect;20.2031&hyph;7 (or, for prior periods,
in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter.




(3) The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (b):






Example.

 In June 1992, A, who is 62, donates to Y University a remainder interest in a personal residence, consisting of a house
and land, subject to a reserved life estate in A. At the time of the gift, the land has a value of $30,000 and the house has
a value of $100,000 with an estimated useful life of 45 years, at the end of which the value of the house is expected to
be $20,000. The portion of the property considered to be depreciable is $80,000 (the value of the house ($100,000)
less its expected value at the end of 45 years ($20,000)). The portion of the property considered to be nondepreciable
is $50,000 (the value of the land at the time of the gift ($20,000) plus the expected value of the house at the end of 45
years ($20,000)). The interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for June 1992 is 8.4 percent. Based on an interest
rate of 8.4 percent, the remainder factor for $1.00 prescribed in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7 of this chapter for a person
age 62 is 0.29567. The value of the nondepreciable remainder interest is $14,783.50 (0.29567 times $50,000). The
value of the depreciable remainder interest is $17,387.20 (0.21734, computed under the formula described in paragraph
(b)(2) of this section, times $80,000). Therefore, the value of the remainder interest is $32,170.70.

(e) *&blank;*&blank;*

(1)(i) If the valuation of the remainder interest in the real property is dependent upon the continuation or the termination
of more than one life or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, a special factor must be used.

(ii) The special factor is to be computed on the basis of_

(A) Interest at the rate prescribed under &sect;25.2512&hyph;5 (or, for certain prior periods, &sect;25.2512&hyph;5A)
of this chapter, compounded annually;

(B) Life contingencies determined from the values that are set forth in the mortality table in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7
(or, for certain prior periods, &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter; and

(C) If depreciation is involved, the assumption that the property depreciates on a straight-line basis over its estimated
useful life.

(iii) If any part of the property is subject to depletion of its natural resources, such depletion must be taken into
account in determining the value of the remainder interest.

Pooled Income Fund Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989 


&sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6A 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for 
which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989. 


(a) 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which 
the valuation date is before January 1, 1952.

 There was no 
provision for the qualification of pooled income funds under 
section 642 until 1969. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(a) of this chapter 
(Estate Tax Regulations) for the determination of the present 
value of a charitable remainder interest created before 
January 1, 1952. 
(b) 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which 
the valuation date is after December 31, 1951, and before 
January 1, 1971.

 No charitable deduction is allowable for a 
transfer to a pooled income fund for which the valuation date is 
after the effective dates of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 unless 
the pooled income fund meets the requirements of section 
642(c)(5). See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(b) of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations) for the determination of the present value of a 
charitable remainder interest for which the valuation date is 
after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971. 
(c) 

Present value of remainder interest in the case of 
transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is 
after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983.

 For the 
determination of the present value of a remainder interest in 
property transferred to a pooled income fund for which the 
valuation date is after December 31, 1970, and before 
December 1, 1983, see &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(c) of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations) and former &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (as contained in the 
26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994). 
(d) 

Present value of remainder interest dependent on the 
termination of one life in the case of transfers to pooled income 
funds made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation date 
is before May 1, 1989

_(1) 

In general.

 For transfers to pooled 
income funds made after November 30, 1983, for which the 
valuation date is before May 1, 1989, the present value of the 
remainder interest at the time of the transfer of property to the 
fund is determined by computing the present value (at the time of 
the transfer) of the life income interest in the transferred 
property (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) 
and subtracting that value from the fair market value of the 
transferred property on the valuation date. The present value of 
a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the 
life of one individual is computed by use of Table G in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section. For purposes of the computation under 
this section, the age of an individual is to be taken as the age 
of the individual at the individual's nearest birthday. 
(2) 

Present value of life income interest.

 The present 
value of the life income interest in property transferred to a 
pooled income fund shall be computed on the basis of: 
(i) Life contingencies determined from the values of 

lx

 that 
are set forth in Table LN of &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(d)(6) of this chapter 
(Estate Tax Regulations); and 
(ii) Discount at a rate of interest, compounded annually, 
equal to the highest yearly rate of return of the pooled income 
fund for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding its taxable 
year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made. For 
purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the yearly rate of return of a 
pooled income fund is determined as provided in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(c) 
unless the highest yearly rate of return is deemed to be 9 
percent. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the first 
taxable year of a pooled income fund is considered a taxable year 
even though the taxable year consists of less than 12 months. 
However, appropriate adjustments must be made to annualize the 
rate of return earned by the fund for that period. Where it 
appears from the facts and circumstances that the highest yearly 
rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the 
taxable year in which the transfer of property is made has been 
purposely manipulated to be substantially less than the rate of 
return that would otherwise be reasonably anticipated with the 
purpose of obtaining an excessive charitable deduction, that rate 
of return may not be used. In that case, the highest yearly rate 
of return of the fund is determined by treating the fund as a 
pooled income fund that has been in existence for less than 3 
preceding taxable years. If a pooled income fund has been in 
existence less than 3 taxable years immediately preceding the 
taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is 
made, the highest yearly rate of return is deemed to be 9 
percent. 


Par. 8.

 Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6 is amended as follows: 
1. The section heading is revised. 
2. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised.

8. Paragraph (f) is added. 
9. The added and revised provisions read as follows: 


&sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6 

Valuation of a remainder interest in property 
transferred to a pooled income fund after April 30, 1989. 


(a) 

In general.

 (1) For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 
2106, and 2522, the fair market value of a remainder interest in 
property transferred to a pooled income fund is its present value 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section. 
(2) The present value of a remainder interest at the time of 
the transfer of property to the pooled income fund is determined 
by computing the present value (at the time of the transfer) of 
the life income interest and subtracting that value from the fair 
market value of the transferred property on the valuation date. 
The fact that the income beneficiary may not receive the last 
income payment, as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5, 
is not taken into account for purposes of determining the value 
of the life income interest. For purposes of this section, the 
valuation date is the date on which property is transferred to 
the fund by the donor except that, for purposes of section 2055 
or 2106, it is the alternate valuation date, if elected, under 
the provisions and limitations set forth in section 2032 and the 
regulations thereunder. 
(3) Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of 
the remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income 
fund must be supported by a statement attached to the return 
showing the computation of the present value of the interest. 
(b) 

Actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service. 


The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of 
actuarial factors and examples that illustrate the use of the 
tables in determining the value of remainder interests in 
property. Section 1.7520&hyph;1(c)(2) refers to government 
publications that provide additional tables of factors and 
examples of computations for more complex situations. If the 
computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in 
this section, the Commissioner may supply the factor upon a 
request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied 
by a recitation of the facts including the pooled income fund's 
highest yearly rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately 
preceding the date of transfer, the date of birth of each 
measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request 
for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a 
ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 
(see &sect;&sect;601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and 
include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner 
furnishes the factor, a copy of the letter supplying the factor 
should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is 
claimed. If the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the 
taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the 
principles set forth in this section. 
(c) 

Computation of pooled income fund's yearly rate of 
return.

 (1) For purposes of determining the present value of the 
life income interest, the yearly rate of return earned by a 
pooled income fund for a taxable year is the percentage obtained 
by dividing the amount of income earned by the pooled income fund 
for the taxable year by an amount equal to_
(i) The average fair market value of the property in such 
fund for that taxable year; less 
(ii) The corrective term adjustment. 


* * * * * 


(d) 

Valuation.

 The present value of the remainder interest 
in property transferred to a pooled income fund after April 30, 
1989, is determined under paragraph (e) of this section. The 
present value of the remainder interest in property transferred 
to a pooled income fund for which the valuation date is before 
May 1, 1989, is determined under the following sections:

(e) 

 Present value of the remainder interest in the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date
is after April 30, 1989

_(1) 

In general.

 In the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the present value
of a remainder interest is determined under this section. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions
to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). The present value of a remainder interest that is dependent
on the termination of the life of one individual is computed by the use of Table S in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
For purposes of the computations under this section, the age of an individual is the age at the individual's nearest
birthday. If the valuation date of a transfer to a pooled income fund is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994,
a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, in
valuing the transferred interest. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter.)

(2) 

Present value of a remainder interest.

 The present value of a remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income fund is computed on the basis of_

(i) Life contingencies determined from the values of 

lx

 that are set forth in Table 80CNSMT in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations); and

(ii) Discount at a rate of interest, compounded annually, equal to the highest yearly rate of return of pooled income
fund for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding its taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is
made. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the yearly rate of return of a pooled income fund is determined as provided
in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(c) unless the highest rate of return is deemed to be the rate described in paragraph (e)(3)
of this section for funds in existence less than 3 taxable years. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), the first
taxable year of a pooled income fund is considered a taxable year even though the taxable year consists of less than
12 months. However, appropriate adjustments must be made to annualize the rate of return earned by the fund for that
period. Where it appears from the facts and circumstances that the highest yearly rate of return of the fund for the
3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property is made has been purposely
manipulated to be substantially less than the rate of return that would otherwise be reasonably anticipated with
the purpose of obtaining an excessive charitable deduction, that rate of return may not be used. In that case, the highest
yearly rate of return of the fund is determined by treating the fund as a pooled income fund that has been in existence
for less than 3 preceding taxable years.

(3) 

Pooled income funds in existence less than 3 taxable years.

 If a pooled income fund has been in existence less than 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which
the transfer is made to the fund and the transfer to the fund is made after April 30, 1989, the highest rate of return is
deemed to be the interest rate (rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent) that is 1 percent less than the highest
annual average of the monthly section 7520 rates for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year
in which the transfer to the pooled income fund is made. The deemed rate of return for transfers to new pooled income
funds is recomputed each calendar year using the monthly section 7520 rates for the 3-year period immediately preceding
the calendar year in which each transfer to the fund is made until the fund has been in existence for 3 taxable years and
can compute its highest rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer
of property to the fund is made in accordance with the rules set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)
of this section.

(4) 

Computation of value of remainder interest.

 The factor that is used in determining the present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination
of the life of one individual is the factor from Table S in paragraph (e)(5) of this section under the appropriate yearly
rate of return opposite the number that corresponds to the age of the individual upon whose life the value of the remainder
interest is based. The tables in paragraph (e)(5) of this section include factors for yearly rates of return from 4.2
to 14 percent. Many actuarial factors not contained in the tables in paragraph (e)(5) of this section are contained
in Table S in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). A copy
of this publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. For other situations, see &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(b). If the yearly rate of return is a percentage
that is between the yearly rates of return for which factors are provided, a linear interpolation must be made. The
present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the fair market value of the property on the valuation
date by the appropriate remainder factor. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:






Example.

 A, who will be 55 years old on May 8, 1990, transfers $100,000 to a pooled income fund on January 1, 1990, and retains a
life income interest in the property. The highest yearly rate of return earned by the fund for its 3 preceding taxable
years is 9.47 percent. In Table S, the remainder factor opposite 55 years under 9.4 percent is .18785 and under 9.6 percent
is .18322. The present value of the remainder interest is $18,623.00, computed as follows:

&sect;1.664&hyph;2 

Charitable remainder annuity trust.



* * * * *



(c) 

Calculation of the fair market value of the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust. 

For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 2106, and 2522, the fair market value of the remainder interest of a charitable
remainder annuity trust (as described in this section) is the net fair market value (as of the appropriate valuation
date) of the property placed in trust less the present value of the annuity. For purposes of this section, 

valuation date

 means, in general, the date on which the property is transferred to the trust by the donor regardless of when the trust
is created. In the case of transfers to a charitable remainder annuity trust for which the valuation date is after April
30, 1989, if an election is made under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b) to compute the present value of the
charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the
transfer is made, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality
tables. For purposes of section 2055 or 2106, the valuation date is the date of death unless the alternate valuation
date is elected in accordance with section 2032, in which event, and within the limitations set forth in section 2032
and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. If the decedent's estate elects
the alternate valuation date under section 2032 and also elects, under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b),
to use the interest rate component for one of the 2 months preceding the alternate valuation date, the month so elected
is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. The present value of an annuity
is computed under &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for transfers for which the
valuation date is after April 30, 1989, or under &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A (a) through (d) of this chapter, whichever
is applicable, for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b)
(relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). If the valuation date of a transfer
to a charitable remainder annuity trust is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice
89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700 (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter), in valuing the transferred interest.



Par. 12. 

Immediately following &sect;1.664&hyph;4 an undesignated center heading and &sect;1.664&hyph;4A are added to
read as follows:



Unitrust Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989



&sect;1.664&hyph;4A 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989.



(a) 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is before January 1, 1952. 

There was no provision for the qualification of a charitable remainder unitrust under section 664 until 1969. See
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(a) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for the determination of the present value of
a charitable interest for which the valuation date is before January 1, 1952.

(b) 

Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1951, and before January
1, 1971. 

No charitable deduction is allowable for a transfer to a unitrust for which the valuation date is after the effective
dates of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 unless the unitrust meets the requirements of section 664. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(b)
of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for the determination of the present value of a charitable remainder interest
for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971.

(c) 

Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation
date is after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983.

 For the determination of the present value of a charitable remainder unitrust for which the valuation date is after
December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983, see &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(c) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations)
and former &sect;1.664&hyph;4(d) (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994).

Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation
date is after November 30, 1983, and before May 1, 1989

_(1) 

In general. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, in the case of transfers made after November 30,
1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest that is dependent
on a term of years or the termination of the life of one individual is determined under paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(6)
of this section, provided that the amount of the payout as of any payout date during any taxable year of the trust is not
larger than the amount that the trust could distribute on such date under &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(v) if the taxable
year of the trust were to end on such date. The present value of the remainder interest in the trust is determined by computing
the adjusted payout rate (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) and following the procedure outlined in
paragraph (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section, whichever is applicable. The present value of a remainder interest that
is dependent on a term of years is computed under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The present value of a remainder
interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed under paragraph (d)(5) of this
section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for testamentary transfers for which the valuation date is after November
30, 1983, and before August 9, 1984.
(2) 

Rules for determining the present value for testamentary transfers where the decedent dies after November 30, 1983,
and before August 9, 1984.

 For purposes of section 2055 or 2106, if_
(i) The decedent dies after November 30, 1983, and before August 9, 1984; or
(ii) On December 1, 1983, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the disposition of the property could not be
changed, and the decedent died after November 30, 1983, without regaining competency to dispose of the decedent's
property, or died within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first regained competency, the present value determined
under this section of a remainder interest is determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) and paragraphs (d)(3)
through (d)(6) of this section, or &sect;1.664&hyph;4A(c), at the option of the taxpayer.


Par. 13. 

Section 1.664&hyph;4 is amended as follows:
1. Paragraph (a) is revised.
2. Paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) are redesignated as paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(6) of &sect;1.664&hyph;4A,
respectively. 3. Paragraph (b)(1) is redesignated as paragraph (b) and revised.
4. Paragraphs (c) and (d) are revised.
5. The authority citation at the end of the section is removed.
6. Paragraphs (e) and (f) are added.
7. The revisions and additions read as follows:


&sect;1.664&hyph;4 

Calculation of the fair market value of the remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust.


(a) 

Rules for determining present value. 

For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 2106, and 2522, the fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder
unitrust (as described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3) is its present value determined under paragraph (d) of this section.
The present value determined under this section shall be computed on the basis of_
(1) Life contingencies determined as to each life involved, from the values of 

lx 

set forth in Table 80CNSMT contained in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) in
the case of transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, or column 2 of Table LN, of &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(d)(6)
of this chapter in the case of transfers made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989.
See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A (a) through (c) of this chapter, whichever is applicable, for transfers for which the
valuation date is before December 1, 1983;
(2) Interest at the section 7520 rate in the case of transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, or
10 percent in the case of transfers to charitable remainder unitrusts made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation
date is before May 1, 1989. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A (a) through (c) of this chapter, whichever is applicable, for
transfers for which the valuation date is before December 1, 1983; and

(3) The assumption that the amount described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(

i

)(

a

) is distributed in accordance with the payout sequence described in the governing instrument. If the governing instrument
does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period for which the payment is made, for purposes of this
section, the distribution is considered payable on the first day of the period for which the payment is made.
(b) 

Actuarial Computations by the Internal Revenue Service. 

The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of actuarial factors and examples that illustrate
the use of the tables in determining the value of remainder interests in property. Section 1.7520&hyph;1(c)(2) refers
to government publications that provide additional tables of factors and examples of computations for more complex
situations. If the computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in this section, the Commissioner
may supply the factor upon a request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts
including the date of birth of each measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request for a ruling must
comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See
&sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner furnishes the factor, a copy of
the letter supplying the factor should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is claimed. If the Commissioner
does not furnish the factor, the taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the principles set forth
in this section.
(c) 

Statement supporting deduction required. 

Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust must
be supported by a full statement attached to the return showing the computation of the present value of such interest.
(d) 

Valuation. 

The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3)
for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is its present value determined under paragraph
(e) of this section. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described
in &sect;1.664&hyph;3) for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, is its present value determined
under the following sections:

Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation
date is after April 30, 1989

_(1) 

In general.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, in the case of transfers for which the valuation
date is after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest is determined under paragraphs (e)(3) through
(e)(6) of this section, provided that the amount of the payout as of any payout date during any taxable year of the trust
is not larger than the amount that the trust could distribute on such date under &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(v) if the
taxable year of the trust were to end on such date. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions
to the use of the prescribed tables under certain circumstances).
(2) 

Transitional rules for valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts.

 (i) If the valuation date of a transfer to a charitable remainder unitrust is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10,
1994, a transferor can rely upon Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B.
700, in valuing the transferred interest. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter.)
(ii) For purposes of sections 2055, 2106, or 2624, if on May 1, 1989, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the
disposition of the property could not be changed, and the decedent died after April 30, 1989, without having regained
competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or the decedent died within 90 days of the date that the decedent
first regained competency after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest determined under this section
is determined as if the valuation date with respect to the decedent's gross estate is either before May 1, 1989, or after
April 30, 1989, at the option of the decedent's executor.

(3) 

Adjusted payout rate

. For transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the adjusted payout rate is determined by using
the appropriate Table F, contained in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for the section 7520 interest rate applicable
to the transfer. If the interest rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the interest
rate is below 4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The adjusted payout rate is determined
by multiplying the fixed percentage described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(i)(

a

) by the factor describing the payout sequence of the trust and the number of months by which the valuation date for the
first full taxable year of the trust precedes the first payout date for such taxable year. If the governing instrument
does not prescribe when the distribution or distributions shall be made during the taxable year of the trust, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(a).
In the case of a trust having a payout sequence for which no figures have been provided by the appropriate table, and
in the case of a trust that determines the fair market value of the trust assets by taking the average of valuations on
more than one date during the taxable year, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). 

(4) 

Period is a term of years

. If the period described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(5) is a term of years, the factor that is used in determining the
present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is the factor
under the appropriate adjusted payout rate in Table D in paragraph (e)(6) of this section corresponding to the number
of years in the years. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors
are provided in Table D, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined
by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the appropriate valuation date) of the property placed in trust by the
factor determined under this paragraph. For purposes of this section, the valuation date is, in the case of an inter
vivos transfer, the date on which the property is transferred to the trust by the donor. However, if an election is made
under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b) to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the
interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the date of transfer falls, the month
so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. In the case of
a testamentary transfer under section 2055, 2106, or 2624, the valuation date is the date of death, unless the alternate
valuation date is elected under section 2032, in which event, and within the limitations set forth in section 2032
and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. If the decedent's estate elects
the alternate valuation date under section 2032 and also elects, under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b),
to use the interest rate component for one of the 2 months preceding the alternate valuation date, the month so elected
is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. If the adjusted payout rate
is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the adjusted payout rate is less than 4.2 percent
or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the
following example:

 




Example

. D transfers $100,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust on January 1, 1990. The trust instrument requires that the
trust pay 8 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st for a term of 12 years to D in quarterly
payments (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). The section 7520 rate of January 1990 is 9.6 percent. Under
Table F(9.6), the appropriate adjustment factor is .944628 for quarterly payments payable at the end of each quarter.
The adjusted payout rate is 7.557 (8%&times;.944628). Based on the remainder factors in Table D, the present value
of the remainder interest is $38,950.30, computed as follows:

Period is the life of one individual

. If the period described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(5) is the life of one individual, the factor that is used in determining
the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is the
factor in Table U(1) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the appropriate adjusted payout. For purposes of the
computations described in this paragraph, the age of an individual is the age of that individual at the individual's
nearest birthday. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors
are provided in the appropriate table, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest
is determined by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the valuation date as determined in paragraph (e)(4)
of this section) of the property placed in trust by the factor determined under this paragraph (e)(5). If the adjusted
payout rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the adjusted payout rate is below
4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated
by the following example:

 




Example. 

A, who will be 45 years old on February 19, 1990, transfers $100,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust on January 1,
1990. The trust instrument requires that the trust pay to A semiannually (on June 30 and December 31) 9 percent of the
fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st during A's life. The section 7520 rate for January 1990 is 9.6
percent. Under Table F(9.6), the appropriate adjustment factor is .933805 for semiannual payments payable at the
end of the semiannual period. The adjusted payout rate is 8.404 (9%&times;.933805). Based on the remainder factors
in Table U(1), the present value of the remainder interest is $11,098.00, computed as follows:

Actuarial tables for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989. 

For transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the present value of a charitable remainder unitrust
interest that is dependent on a term of years or the termination of a life interest is determined by using the section
7520 rate and the tables set forth below. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use
of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). Many actuarial factors not contained in the following tables
are contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial Values, Beta Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). A
copy of this publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC 20402.

(a) 

General actuarial valuations.

 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and in &sect;1.7520&hyph;3 (relating to exceptions to the use of
prescribed tables under certain circumstances), in the case of certain transactions after April 30, 1989, subject
to income tax, the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or for a term of years (including unitrust interests),
remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)
(and, for certain prior periods, &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter, Estate Tax Regulations, for the computation
of the value of annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions, other
than interests described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.

(2) For a transfer to a pooled income fund after April 30, 1989, see &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (or, for certain prior
periods, &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6A) with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest.

(3) For a transfer to a charitable remainder annuity trust after April 30, 1989, see &sect;1.664&hyph;2 with respect
to the valuation of the remainder interest. See &sect;1.664&hyph;4 (or, for certain prior periods, &sect;1.664&hyph;4A)
with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest in property transferred to a charitable remainder unitrust.

(b) 

Components of valuation_

(1) 

Interest rate component_

(i) 

Section 7520 Interest rate.

 The section 7520 interest rate is the rate of return, rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent, that is equal
to 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate, compounded annually, for purposes of section 1274(d)(1),
for the month in which the valuation date falls. In rounding the rate to the nearest two-tenths of a percent, any rate
that is midway between one two-tenths of a percent and another is rounded up to the higher of those two rates. For example,
if 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate is 10.30, the section 7520 interest rate component is 10.4.
The section 7520 interest rate is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin
(see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter).

(ii) 

Valuation date.

 Except as provided in &sect;1.7520&hyph;2, the valuation date is the date on which the transaction takes place.

(2) 

Mortality component.

 The mortality component reflects the mortality data most recently available from the United States census. As new
mortality data becomes available after each decennial census, the mortality component described in this section
will be revised periodically and the revised mortality component tables will be published in the regulations at that
time. For transactions with valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the mortality component table (Table 80CNSMT)
is contained in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations). See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A
for mortality component tables applicable to transactions for which the valuation date falls before May 1, 1989.

(c) 

Tables.

 The present value on the valuation date of an annuity, life estate, term of years, remainder, or reversion is computed
by using the section 7520 interest rate component that is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the mortality
component that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Actuarial factors for determining these present
values are included in tables in these regulations and in publications by the Internal Revenue Service. If a special
factor is required in order to value an interest, the Internal Revenue Service will furnish the factor upon a request
for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts, including the date of birth for
each measuring life and copies of relevant instruments. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for
requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;1, 1994&hyph;1
I.R.B. 10, and subsequent updates, and &sect;&sect;601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee.

(1) 

Regulation sections containing tables with interest rates between 4.2 and 14 percent.

 Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6(e)(4) contains Table S used for determining the present value of a single life remainder
interest in a pooled income fund as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5. Section 1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) contains Table
D (actuarial factors used in determining the present value of a remainder interest postponed for a term of years),
Table U(1) (actuarial factors for one life), and Table F (payout factors) used in determining the present value of
a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3. Section 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6)
of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) contains Table S (actuarial factors for one life), Table B (actuarial factors
used in determining the present value of an interest for a term of years), Table K (annuity end-of-interval adjustment
factors), Table J (term certain annuity beginning-of-interval adjustment factors), and Table 80CNSMT (mortality
components) used in determining the present value of annuities, life estates, remainders, and reversions. The regulations
will be revised periodically to include new mortality component tables and new tables of factors.

(2) 

Internal Revenue Service publications containing tables with interest rates between 2.2 and 26 percent.

 The following documents (with the exception of Publication 1459) have been published for sale by the Superintendent
of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402:

(i) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes
tables of valuation factors, as well as examples that show how to compute other valuation factors, for determining
the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions, measured by one or two lives.
These factors may also be used in the valuation of interests in a charitable remainder annuity trust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;2
of this chapter and a pooled income fund as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter.

of this chapter. 

(d) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective as of May 1, 1989. 



&sect;1.7520&hyph;2 

Valuation of charitable interests. 



(a) 

In general

_(1) 

Valuation. 

Except as otherwise provided in this section and in &sect;1.7520&hyph;3 (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed
tables under certain circumstances), the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or for a term of years,
remainders, and reversions for which an income tax charitable deduction is allowable is the present value of such
interests determined under &sect;1.7520&hyph;1. 

(2) 

Prior-month election rule. 

If any part of the property interest transferred qualifies for an income tax charitable deduction under section 170(c),
the taxpayer may elect (under paragraph (b) of this section) to compute the present value of the interest transferred
by use of the section 7520 interest rate for the month during which the interest is transferred or the section 7520 interest
rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month during which the interest is transferred. Paragraph
(b) of this section explains how a prior-month election is made. The interest rate for the month so elected is the applicable
section 7520 interest rate. If the actuarial factor for either or both of the 2 months preceding the month during which
the interest is transferred is based on a mortality experience that is different from the mortality experience at
the date of the transfer and if the taxpayer elects to use the section 7520 rate for a prior month with the different mortality
experience, the taxpayer must use the actuarial factor derived from the mortality experience in effect during the
month of the section 7520 rate elected. All actuarial computations relating to the transfer must be made by applying
the interest rate component and the mortality component of the month elected by the taxpayer. 

(3) 

Transfers of more than one interest in the same property. 

If a taxpayer transfers more than one interest in the same property at the same time, for purposes of valuing the transferred
interests, the taxpayer must use the same interest rate and mortality component for each interest in the property
transferred. If more than one interest in the same property is transferred in two or more separate transfers at different
times, the value of each interest is determined by the use of the interest rate component and mortality component in
effect during the month of the transfer of that interest or, if applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
either of the two months preceding the month of the transfer. 

(4) 

Information required with tax return. 

The following information must be attached to the income tax return (or to the amended return) if the taxpayer claims
a charitable deduction for the present value of a temporary or remainder interest in property_ 

(i) A complete description of the interest that is transferred, including a copy of the instrument of transfer; 

(ii) The valuation date of the transfer; 

(iii) The names and identification numbers of the beneficiaries of the transferred interest; 

(iv) The names and birthdates of any measuring lives, a description of any relevant terminal illness condition of
any measuring life, and (if applicable) an explanation of how any terminal illness condition was taken into account
in valuing the interest; and 

(v) A computation of the deduction showing the applicable section 7520 interest rate that is used to value the transferred
interest. 

(5) 

Place for filing returns. 

See section 6091 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder for the place for filing the return or
other document required by this section. 

(b) 

Election of interest rate component

_(1) 

Time for making election. 

A taxpayer makes a prior-month election under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by attaching the information described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the taxpayer's income tax return or to an amended return for that year that is
filed within 24 months after the later of the date the original return for the year was filed or the due date for filing
the return.

(2) 

Manner of making election. 

A statement that the prior-month election under section 7520(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is being made and that
identifies the elected month must be attached to the income tax return (or to the amended return). 

(3) 

Revocability. 

The prior-month election may be revoked by filing an amended return within 24 months after the later of the date the
original return of tax for the year was filed or the due date for filing the return. The revocation must be filed in the
place referred to in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. 

(c) 

Effective dates. 

Paragraph (a) of this section is effective as of May 1, 1989. Paragraph (b) of this section is effective for elections
made after June 10, 1994.

Par. 20. 

Immediately following &sect;20.2046&hyph;1 an undesignated 
center heading and &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A are added to read as follows: 



Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989 



&sect;20.2031&hyph;7A 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term 
of years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
before May 1, 1989. 



(a) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
before January 1, 1952. 

Except as otherwise provided in 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7(b), if the valuation date of the decedent's gross 
estate is before January 1, 1952, the present value of annuities, 
life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions is 
their present value determined under this section. If the 
valuation of the interest involved is dependent upon the 
continuation or termination of one or more lives or upon a term 
certain concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the 
present value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 
4 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies as 
to each life involved from values that are based on the 
Actuaries' or Combined Experience Table of Mortality, as 
extended. This table and related factors are described in former 
&sect;81.10 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 81 edition revised as of 
April 1, 1958). The present value of an interest measured by a 
term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 
4 percent a year. 

(b) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971.

 Except as 
otherwise provided in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(b), if the valuation date for 
the decedent's gross estate is after December 31, 1951, and 
before January 1, 1971, the present value of annuities, life 
estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their 
present value determined under this section. If the valuation of 
the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or 
termination of one or more lives, or upon a term certain 
concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the present 
value is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 31/2 
percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies as to 
each life involved are taken from U.S. Life Table 38. This table 
and related factors are set forth in former &sect;20.2031&hyph;7 (as 
contained in the 26 CFR Part 20 edition revised as of April 1, 
1984). Special factors involving one and two lives may be found 
in or computed with the use of tables contained in the 
publication entitled ``Actuarial Values for Estate and Gift Tax,'' 
Internal Revenue Service Publication Number 11 (Rev. 5&hyph;59). This 
publication is no longer available for purchase from the 
Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be obtained by 
requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 11), 
room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin 
Station, Washington, DC 20044. The present value of an interest 
measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest 
at the rate of 31/2 percent a year. 

(c) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983. 

Except as 
otherwise provided in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(b), if the valuation date of the 
decedent's gross estate is after December 31, 1970, and before 
December 1, 1983, the present value of annuities, life estates, 
terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their present value 
determined under this section. If the valuation of the interest 
involved is dependent upon the continuation of or termination of 
one or more lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or 
more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the 
basis of interest at the rate of 6 percent a year, compounded 
annually, and life contingencies are determined as to each male 
and female life involved, from values that are set forth in Table 
LN. Table LN contains values that are taken from the life table 
for total males and the life table for total females appearing as 
Tables 2 and 3, respectively, in United States Life Tables: 1959&hyph; 
1960, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, 
Public Health Service. Table LN and related factors are set 
forth in former &sect;20.2031&hyph;10 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 20 
edition revised as of April 1, 1994). Special factors involving 
one and two lives may be found in or computed with the use of 
tables contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 723,

(d) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
after November 30, 1983, and before May 1, 1989

_(1) 

In general.

 
(i) Except as otherwise provided in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(b), if the 
decedent died after November 30, 1983, and the valuation date for 
the gross estate is before May 1, 1989, the fair market value of 
annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversions is their present value determined under this section. 
If the decedent died after November 30, 1983, and before 
August 9, 1984, or, in cases where the valuation date of the 
decedent's gross estate is before May 1, 1989, if, on December 1, 
1983, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the 
disposition of the decedent's property could not be changed, and 
the decedent died on or after December 1, 1983, without having 
regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or if 
the decedent died within 90 days of the date on which the 
decedent first regained competency, the fair market value of 
annuities, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and 
reversions included in the gross estate of such decedent is their 
present value determined under either this section or &sect;20.2031&hyph;
7A(c), at the option of the taxpayer. The value of annuities 
issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, and of 
insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the 
decedent, is determined under &sect;20.2031&hyph;8. The fair market value 
of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as 
defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is its present value 
determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4 of this chapter. The fair market value 
of a life interest or term for years in a charitable remainder 
unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date 
of valuation less the fair market value of the remainder interest 
on such date determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4 of this chapter. The fair 
market value of the interests in a pooled income fund, as defined 
in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter, is their value determined under 
&sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6 of this chapter. 



* * * * * 



(iii) In all examples set forth in this section, the 
decedent is assumed to have died on or after August 9, 1984, with 
the valuation date of the decedent's gross estate before May 1, 
1989, and to have been competent to change the disposition of the 
property on December 1, 1983.

Par. 22. 

New &sect;20.2031&hyph;7 is added to read as follows: 



&sect;20.2031&hyph;7 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of 
decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is 
after April 30, 1989. 



(a) 

In general. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section and &sect;20.7520&hyph;3(b) (pertaining to certain 
limitations on the use of prescribed tables), the fair market 
value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversionary interests for estates of decedents is the present 
value of such interests, determined under paragraph (d) of this 
section. The regulations in this and in related sections provide 
tables with standard actuarial factors and examples that 
illustrate how to use the tables to compute the present value of 
ordinary annuity, life, and remainder interests in property. 
These sections also refer to standard and special actuarial 
factors that may be necessary to compute the present value of 
similar interests in more unusual fact situations. 

(b) 

Commercial annuities and insurance contracts.

 The value 
of annuities issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, 
and of insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the 
decedent, is determined under &sect;20.2031&hyph;8. See &sect;20.2042&hyph;1 with 
respect to insurance policies on the decedent's life. 

(c) 

Actuarial valuations before May 1, 1989.

 The present 
value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversions for estates of decedents for which the valuation date 
of the gross estate is before May 1, 1989, is determined under 
the following sections:

Actuarial valuations after April 30, 1989

_(1) 

In general.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and &sect;20.7520&hyph;3(b) (pertaining to certain
limitations on the use of prescribed tables), if the valuation date for the gross estate of the decedent is after April
30, 1989, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversionary interests
is their present value determined by use of standard or special section 7520 actuarial factors. These factors are
derived by using the appropriate section 7520 interest rate and, if applicable, the mortality component for the valuation
date of the interest that is being valued. See &sect;&sect;20.7520&hyph;1 through 20.7520&hyph;4. 

(2) 

Specific Interests

_(i) 

Charitable Remainder Trusts.

 The fair market value of a remainder interest in a pooled income fund, as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this
chapter, is its value determined under &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder
interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust, as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;2(a) of this chapter, is its present
value determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;2(c) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a
charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is its present value determined
under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or term of years in a charitable
remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of valuation less the fair market value of
the remainder interest on that date determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. 

(ii) 

Ordinary remainder and reversionary interests.

 If the interest to be valued is to take effect after a definite number of years or after the death of one individual, the
present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder interest
actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and remainder interest period)
in Table B (for a term certain) or Table S (for one measuring life), as the case may be. Tables B and S are included in paragraph
(d)(6) of this section and in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457. For information about obtaining actuarial
factors for other types of remainder interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 

(iii) 

Ordinary term-of-years and life interests.

 If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the income of certain property, or to use certain nonincome-producing
property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying
the value of the property by the appropriate term-of-years or life interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to
the applicable section 7520 interest rate and term-of-years or life interest period). Internal Revenue Service
Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors for an interest for a term of years in Table B and for the life of one individual
in Table S. However, term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6)
of this chapter. If Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of term-of-years and
life interest actuarial factors) is not conveniently available, an actuarial factor for the interest may be derived
mathematically. This actuarial factor may be derived by subtracting the correlative remainder factor (that corresponds
to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the term of years or the life) in Table B (for a term of years) or in Table
S (for the life of one individual) in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000. For information
about obtaining actuarial factors for other types of term-of-years and life interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this
section. 

(iv) 

Annuities.

 (A) If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the end of each year for
a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the aggregate
amount payable annually by the appropriate annuity actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section
7520 interest rate and annuity period). Internal Revenue Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors in Table B
(for an annuity payable for a term of years) and in Table S (for an annuity payable for the life of one individual). However,
annuity actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If Internal Revenue
Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of annuity actuarial factors) is not conveniently available,
a required annuity factor for a term of years or for one life may be mathematically derived. This annuity factor may
be derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest
rate and annuity period) in Table B (in the case of a term-of-years annuity) or in Table S (in the case of a one-life annuity)
in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, as the case may be, from 1.000000 and then dividing the result by the applicable
section 7520 interest rate expressed as a decimal number. 

(B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained
by multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment
factor set forth in Table K for payments made at the end of the specified periods. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B)
are illustrated by the following example:

 




Example.

 At the time of the decedent's death in January 1990, the annuitant, age 72, is entitled to receive an annuity of $15,000
a year for life payable in equal monthly installments at the end of each period. The section 7520 rate for January 1990
is 9.6 percent. Under Table S, the remainder factor at 9.6 percent for an individual aged 72 is .40138. By converting
the remainder factor to an annuity factor, as described above, the annuity factor at 9.6 percent for an individual
aged 72 is 6.2356 (1.00000 minus .40138, divided by .096). Under Table K, the adjustment factor under the column for
payments made at the end of each monthly period at the rate of 9.6 percent is 1.0433. The aggregate annual amount, $15,000,
is multiplied by the factor 6.2356 and the product multiplied by 1.0433. The present value of the annuity at the date
of the decedent's death is, therefore, $97,584.02 ($15,000&times;6.2356&times;1.0433).

<TEXT>
 

(C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term
of years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity
factor described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so obtained is then multiplied by the
adjustment factor in Table J at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified
periods. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for
one or more lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment plus the present value of a similar annuity,
the first payment of which is not to be made until the end of the payment period, determined as provided in this paragraph
(d)(2)(iv). 
(v) 

Annuity and unitrust interests for a term of years or until the prior death of an individual.

 See &sect;25.2512&hyph;5(d)(2)(v) of this chapter for examples explaining how to compute the present value of an
annuity or unitrust interest that is payable until the earlier of the lapse of a specific number of years or the death
of an individual. 
(3) 

Transitional rule.

 (i) If the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a taxpayer can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24,
1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700 (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). 
(ii) If a decedent dies after April 30, 1989, and if on May 1, 1989, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the
disposition of the decedent's property could not be changed, and the decedent dies without having regained competency
to dispose of the decedent's property or dies within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first regains competency,
the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions included in the gross
estate of the decedent is their present value determined either under this section or under the corresponding section
applicable at the time the decedent became mentally incompetent, at the option of the decedent's executor. For example,
see &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A(d). 
(4) 

Publications and actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service.

 Many standard actuarial factors not included in paragraph (d)(6) of this section are included in Internal Revenue
Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). Publication 1457 also includes examples
that illustrate how to compute many special factors for more unusual situations. A copy of this publication may be
purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
If a special factor is required in the case of an actual decedent, the Service may furnish the factor to the executor
upon a request for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including a statement
of the date of birth for each measuring life, the date of the decedent's death, any other applicable dates, and a copy
of the will, trust, or other relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting
a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see &sect;&sect;601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. 
(5) 

Examples.

 The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 







Example 1. Remainder payable at an individual's death.

 The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive certain property worth $50,000 upon the death of the
decedent's elder sister, to whom the income was bequeathed for life. The decedent died in February 1990. At the time
of the decedent's death, the elder sister was 47 years 5 months old. In February 1990, the section 7520 rate was 9.8 percent.
Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the remainder factor at 9.8 percent for determining the present
value of the remainder interest due at the death of a person aged 47, the number of years nearest the elder sister's actual
age at the decedent's death, is .11352. The present value of the remainder interest at the date of the decedent's death
is, therefore, $5,676.00 ($50,000&times;.11352). 



Example 2. Income payable for an individual's life.

 A's parent bequeathed an income interest in property to A for life, with the remainder interest passing to B at A's death.
At the time of the parent's death in October 1989, the value of the property was $50,000 and A was 30 years 10 months old.
The section 7520 rate in October 1989 was 10.2 percent. Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the remainder
factor at 10.2 percent for determining the present value of the remainder interest due at the death of a person aged
31, the number of years closest to A's age at the decedent's death, is .03753. Converting this remainder factor to an
income factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the factor for determining the present value
of an income interest for the life of a person aged 31 is .96247. The present value of A's interest at the time of the parent's
death is, therefore, $48,123.50 ($50,000&times;.96247). 



Example 3. Annuity payable for an individual's life.

 A purchased an annuity for the benefit of both A and B. Under the terms of the annuity contract, at A's death, a survivor
annuity of $10,000 a year payable in equal semiannual installments made at the end of each interval is payable to B for
life. A died in September 1989. For September 1989, the section 7520 rate was 9.6 percent. At A's death, B was 45 years
7 months old. Under Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the factor at 9.6 percent for determining the present
value of the remainder interest at the death of a person age 46 (the number of years nearest B's actual age) is .11013.
By converting the factor to an annuity factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the factor for
the present value of an annuity payable until the death of a person age 46 is 9.2695 (1.00000 minus .11013, divided by
.096). The adjustment factor from Table K in paragraph (d)(6) of this section at an interest rate of 9.6 percent for
semiannual annuity payments made at the end of the period is 1.0235. The present value of the annuity at the date of A's
death is, therefore, $94,873.33 ($10,000&times;9.2695&times;1.0235). 



Example 4. Annuity payable for a term of years.

 The decedent, or the decedent's estate, was entitled to receive an annuity of $10,000 a year payable in equal quarterly
installments at the end of each quarter throughout a term certain. The decedent died in February 1990. For February
1990, the section 7520 rate was 9.8 percent. A quarterly payment had just been made prior to the decedent's death and
payments were to continue for 5 more years. Under Table B in paragraph (d)(6) of this section for the interest rate of
9.8 percent, the factor for the present value of a remainder interest due after a term of 5 years is .626597. Converting
the factor to an annuity factor, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the factor for the present value
of an annuity for a term of 5 years is 3.8102. The adjustment factor from Table K in paragraph (d)(6) of this section at
an interest rate of 9.8 percent for quarterly annuity payments made at the end of the period is 1.0360. The present value
of the annuity is, therefore, $39,473.67 ($10,000&times;3.8102&times;1.0360). 





(6) 

Actuarial Tables.

 Except as provided in &sect;20.7520&hyph;3(b) (pertaining to certain limitations on the use of prescribed tables),
the following tables must be used in the application of the provisions of this section when the section 7520 interest
rate component is between 4.2 and 14 percent.

General Actuarial Valuations 


&sect;20.7520&hyph;1 

Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests 
for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary 
interests. 


(a) 

General actuarial valuations.

 (1) Except as otherwise 
provided in this section and in &sect;20.7520&hyph;3 (relating to 
exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain 
circumstances), in the case of estates of decedents with 
valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the fair market value of 
annuities, interests for life or for a term of years (including 
unitrust interests), remainders, and reversions is their present 
value determined under this section. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d) (and, for 
certain prior periods, &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) of this chapter for the 
computation of the value of annuities, unitrust interests, life 
estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions, other than 
interests described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
section. 
(2) In the case of a transfer to a pooled income fund with a 
valuation date after April 30, 1989, see &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (or, for 
certain prior periods, &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6A) of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations) with respect to the valuation of the remainder 
interest. 
(3) In the case of a transfer to a charitable remainder 
annuity trust with a valuation date after April 30, 1989, see 
&sect;1.664&hyph;2 of this chapter with respect to the valuation of the 
remainder interest. See &sect;1.664&hyph;4 (or, for certain prior periods, 
&sect;1.664&hyph;4A) of this chapter with respect to the valuation of the 
remainder interest in property transferred to a charitable 
remainder unitrust. 
(b) 

Components of valuation

_(1) 

Interest rate component

_(i) 

Section 7520 Interest rate.

 The section 7520 interest rate 
is the rate of return, rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one 
percent, that is equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal 
mid-term rate, compounded annually, for purposes of section 
1274(d)(1), for the month in which the valuation date falls. In 
rounding the rate to the nearest two-tenths of a percent, any 
rate that is midway between one two-tenths of a percent and 
another is rounded up to the higher of those two rates. For 
example, if 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate 
is 10.30, the section 7520 interest rate component is 10.4. The 
section 7520 interest rate is published monthly by the Internal 
Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See 
&sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). 
(ii) 

Valuation date.

 Generally, the valuation date is the 
date on which the transfer takes place. For estate tax purposes, 
the valuation date is the date of the decedent's death, unless 
the executor elects the alternate valuation date in accordance 
with section 2032, in which event, and under the limitations 
prescribed in section 2032 and the regulations thereunder, the 
valuation date is the alternate valuation date. For special 
rules in the case of charitable transfers, see &sect;20.7520&hyph;2. 
(2) 

Mortality component.

 The mortality component reflects 
the mortality data most recently available from the United States 
census. As new mortality data becomes available after each 
decennial census, the mortality component described in this 
section will be revised periodically and the revised mortality 
component tables will be published in the regulations at that 
time. For decedents' estates with valuation dates after 
April 30, 1989, the mortality component table (Table 80CNSMT) is 
included in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6). See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A for mortality 
component tables applicable to decedent's estates with valuation 
dates before May 1, 1989. 
(c) 

Tables.

 The present value on the valuation date of an 
annuity, life estate, term of years, remainder, or reversion is 
computed by using the section 7520 interest rate component that 
is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the 
mortality component that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Actuarial factors for determining these present values 
are included in tables in these regulations and in publications 
by the Internal Revenue Service. If a special factor is required 
in order to value an interest, the Internal Revenue Service will 
furnish the factor upon a request for a ruling. The request for 
a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts, 
including the date of birth for each measuring life and copies of 
relevant instruments. A request for a ruling must comply with 
the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically 
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;1, 1994&hyph;1 
I.R.B. 10, and the first Rev. Proc. published each year, and 
&sect;&sect;601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include 
payment of the required user fee. 
(1) 

Regulation sections containing tables with interest 
rates between 4.2 and 14 percent.

 Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6(e)(4) of 
this chapter contains Table S used for determining the present 
value of a single life remainder interest in a pooled income fund 
as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations). Section 1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) of this chapter contains 
Table D (actuarial factors used in determining the present value 
of a remainder interest postponed for a term of years), Table 
U(1) (actuarial factors for one life), and Table F (payout 
factors) used in determining the present value of a remainder 
interest in a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter. Section 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6)
contains Table S 
(actuarial factors for one life), Table B (actuarial factors used 
in determining the present value of an interest for a term of 
years), Table K (annuity end-of-interval adjustment factors), 
Table J (term certain annuity beginning-of-interval adjustment 
factors), and Table 80CNSMT (mortality components) used in 
determining the present value of annuities, life estates, 
remainders, and reversions. The regulations will be revised 
periodically to include new mortality component tables and new 
tables of factors.

(2) 

Internal Revenue Service publications containing tables 
with interest rates between 2.2 and 26 percent.

 The following 
documents (except for Publication 1459) have been published for 
sale by the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402: 
(i) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial 
Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes tables 
of valuation factors, as well as examples that show how to 
compute other valuation factors, for determining the present 
value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversions, measured by one or two lives. These factors may also 
be used in the valuation of interests in a charitable remainder 
annuity trust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;2 of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations) and a pooled income fund as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 
of this chapter. 
(ii) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial 
Values, Beta Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes term 
certain tables and tables of one and two life valuation factors 
for determining the present value of remainder interests in a 
charitable remainder unitrust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this 
chapter. 
(iii) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1459, ``Actuarial 
Values, Gamma Volume,'' (8&hyph;89) is no longer available for purchase 
from the Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be 
obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS 
Publication 1459), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, 
Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. This publication 
includes tables for computing depreciation adjustment factors. 
See &sect;1.170A&hyph;12 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations). 
(d) 

Effective date.

 This section is effective as of May 1, 
1989. 


&sect;20.7520&hyph;2 

Valuation of charitable interests. 


(a) 

In general

_(1) 

Valuation.

 Except as otherwise provided 
in this section and in &sect;20.7520&hyph;3 (relating to exceptions to the 
use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances), the fair 
market value of annuities, interests for life or for a term of 
years, remainders, and reversions for which an estate tax 
charitable deduction is allowable is the present value of such 
interests determined under &sect;20.7520&hyph;1. 
(2) 

Prior-month election rule.

 If any part of the property 
interest transferred qualifies for an estate tax charitable 
deduction under section 2055 or 2106, the executor may compute 
the present value of the transferred interest by use of the 
section 7520 interest rate for the month during which the 
interest is transferred or the section 7520 interest rate for 
either of the 2 months preceding the month during which the 
interest is transferred. Paragraph (b) of this section explains 
how a prior-month election is made. The interest rate for the 
month so elected is the applicable section 7520 interest rate. 
If the executor elects the alternate valuation date under section 
2032 and also elects to use the section 7520 interest rate for 
either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the interest 
is transferred, the month so elected (either of the 2 months 
preceding the month in which the alternate valuation date falls) 
is the valuation date. If the actuarial factor for either or 
both of the 2 months preceding the month during which the 
interest is transferred is based on a mortality experience that 
is different from the mortality experience at the date of the 
transfer and if the executor elects to use the section 7520 rate 
for a prior month with the different mortality experience, the 
executor must use the actuarial factor derived from the mortality 
experience in effect during the month of the section 7520 rate 
elected. All actuarial computations relating to the transfer 
must be made by applying the interest rate component and the 
mortality component of the month elected by the executor. 
(3) 

Transfers of more than one interest in the same 
property.

 If a decedent's estate includes the transfer of more 
than one interest in the same property, the executor must, for 
purposes of valuing the transferred interests, use the same 
interest rate and mortality components for each interest in the 
property transferred. 
(4) 

Information required with tax return.

 The following 
information must be attached to the estate tax return (or be 
filed subsequently as supplemental information to the return) if 
the estate claims a charitable deduction for the present value of 
a temporary or remainder interest in property_
(i) A complete description of the interest that is 
transferred, including a copy of the instrument of transfer; 
(ii) The valuation date of the transfer; 
(iii) The names and identification numbers of the 
beneficiaries of the transferred interest; 
(iv) The names and birthdates of any measuring lives, 
a description of any relevant terminal illness condition of 
any measuring life, and (if applicable) an explanation of 
how any terminal illness condition was taken into account in 
valuing the interest; and

(v) A computation of the deduction showing the applicable section 7520 interest rate that is used to value the transferred
interest.

(5) 

Place for filing returns.

 See section 6091 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder for the place for filing the return or
other document required by this section.

(b) 

Election of interest rate component

_(1) 

Time for making election.

 An executor makes a prior-month election under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by attaching the information described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the decedent's estate tax return or by filing a supplemental statement of the
election information within 24 months after the later of the date the original estate tax return was filed or the due
date for filing the return.

(2) 

Manner of making election.

 A statement that the prior-month election under section 7520(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is being made and that
identifies the elected month must be attached to the estate tax return (or by subsequently filing the statement as
supplemental information to the return).

(3) 

Revocability.

 The prior-month election may be revoked by filing a statement of supplemental information within 24 months after
the later of the date the original return of tax for the decedent's estate was filed or the due date for filing the return.
The revocation must be filed in the place referred to in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(c) 

Effective dates.

 Paragraph (a) of this section is effective as of May 1, 1989. Paragraph (b) of this section is effective for elections
made after June 10, 1994.

Par. 28.

 Immediately following &sect;25.2518&hyph;3 an undesignated center heading and &sect;25.2512&hyph;5A are added
to read as follows:



Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989



&sect;25.2512&hyph;5A

 Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests
transferred before May 1, 1989.



(a) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred
before January 1, 1952.

 Except as otherwise provided in &sect;25.2512&hyph;5(b), if the transfer was made before January 1, 1952, the present
value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under
this section. If the valuation of the interest involved is dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or
more lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the
basis of interest at the rate of 4 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies for each life involved
from values that are based upon the ``Actuaries' or Combined Experience Table of Mortality, as extended.'' This table
and many additional factors are described in former &sect;86.19 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 81 edition revised
as of April 1, 1958). The present value of an interest measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest
at the rate of 4 percent a year. 

(b) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred
after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971. 

Except as otherwise provided in &sect;25.2512&hyph;5(b), the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of
years, remainders, and reversions transferred after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971, is the present
value of such interests determined under this section. If the value of the interest involved is dependent upon the
continuation or termination of one or more lives, the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of interest
at the rate of 31/2 percent a year, compounded annually, and life contingencies for each life involved from U.S. Life
Table 38. This table and many accompanying factors are set forth in former &sect;25.2512&hyph;5 (as contained in
the 26 CFR Part 25 edition revised as of April 1, 1984). Special factors involving one and two lives may be found in or
computed with the use of tables contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication Number 11, ``Actuarial Values
for Estate and Gift Tax,'' (Rev. 5&hyph;59). This publication is no longer available for purchase from the Superintendent
of Documents. However, it may be obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 11), room 5228,
Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. The present value of an interest
measured by a term of years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 31/2 percent a year.

(c) 

Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of 
years, and remainder or reversionary interests transferred after 
December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983. 

Except as 
otherwise provided in &sect;25.2512&hyph;5(b), the present value of 
annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversions transferred after December 31, 1970, and before 
December 1, 1983, is the present value of such interests 
determined under this section. If the interest to be valued is 
dependent upon the continuation or termination of one or more 
lives or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more lives, 
the factor for the present value is computed on the basis of 
interest at the rate of 6 percent a year, compounded annually, 
and life contingencies determined for each male and female life 
involved, from the values that are set forth in Table LN. Table 
LN contains values that are taken from the life table for total 
males and the life table for total females appearing as Tables 2 
and 3, respectively, in United States Life Tables: 1959&hyph;61, 
published by the Department of Health and Human Services, Public 
Health Service. Table LN and accompanying factors are set forth 
in former &sect;25.2512&hyph;9 (as contained in the 26 CFR Part 25 edition 
revised as of April 1, 1994). Special factors involving one and 
two lives may be found in or computed with the use of tables 
contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 723, entitled 
``Actuarial Values I: Valuation of Last Survivor Charitable 
Remainders'' (12&hyph;70), and Internal Revenue Service Publication 
723A, entitled ``Actuarial Values II: Factors at 6 Percent 
Involving One and Two Lives'' (12&hyph;70). These publications are no 
longer available for purchase from the Superintendent of 
Documents. However, a copy of each may be obtained from: 
CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 723/723A), room 5228, Internal 
Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 
20044. The present value of an interest measured by a term of 
years is computed on the basis of interest at the rate of 6 
percent a year.

Par. 30. 

New &sect;25.2512&hyph;5 is added to read as follows: 


&sect;25.2512&hyph;5 

Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests 
for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary 
interests transferred after April 30, 1989. 


(a) 

In general. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section and &sect;25.7520&hyph;3(b), the fair market value of 
annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms of years, 
remainders, and reversions transferred by gift is the present 
value of the interests determined under paragraph (d) of this

Actuarial valuations after April 30, 1989_

(1) 

In general.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and &sect;25.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions
to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances), if the valuation date for the gift is after April 30,
1989, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions transferred after
April 30, 1989, is the present value of such interests determined by use of standard or special section 7520 actuarial
factors. These factors are derived by using the appropriate section 7520 interest rate and, if applicable, the mortality
component for the valuation date of the interest that is being valued. See &sect;&sect;25.7520&hyph;1 through 25.7520&hyph;4.
The fair market value of a qualified annuity interest described in section 2702(b)(1) and a qualified unitrust interest
described in section 2702(b)(2) is the present value of such interests determined under &sect;25.7520&hyph;1(c).

(2) 

Specific interests.

 When the donor transfers property in trust or otherwise and retains an interest therein, generally, the value of the
gift is the value of the property transferred less the value of the donor's retained interest. However, if the donor
transfers property after October 8, 1990, to or for the benefit of a member of the donor's family, the value of the gift
is the value of the property transferred less the value of the donor's retained interest as determined under section
2702. If the donor assigns or relinquishes an annuity, life estate, remainder, or reversion that the donor holds by
virtue of a transfer previously made by the donor or another, the value of the gift is the value of the interest transferred.
However, see section 2519 for a special rule in the case of the assignment of an income interest by a person who received
the interest from a spouse.

(i) 

Charitable remainder trusts.

 The fair market value of a remainder interest in a pooled income fund, as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this
chapter (Income Tax Regulations), is its value determined under &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) of this chapter. The
fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust, as described in &sect;1.664&hyph;2(a)
of this chapter, is its present value determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;2(c) of this chapter. The fair market value
of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is
its present value determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest
or term for years in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of transfer
less the fair market value of the remainder interest, determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter.

(ii) 

Ordinary remainder and reversionary interests.

 If the interest to be valued is to take effect after a definite number of years or after the death of one individual, the
present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder interest
actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and remainder interest period)
in Table B (for a term certain) or Table S (for one measuring life), as the case may be. Tables B and S are included in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6)
of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) and in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457. For information about
obtaining actuarial factors for other types of remainder interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

(iii) 

Ordinary term-of-years and life interests.

 If the 
interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the 
income of certain property, or to use certain nonincome-producing 
property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual, 
the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the 
value of the property by the appropriate term-of-years or life 
interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable 
section 7520 interest rate and term-of-years or life interest 
period). Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes 
actuarial factors for an interest for a term of years in Table B 
and for the life of one individual in Table S. However, term-of-
years and life interest actuarial factors are not included in 
Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If 
Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable 
source of term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors) is 
not conveniently available, an actuarial factor for the interest 
may be derived mathematically. This actuarial factor may be 
derived by subtracting the correlative remainder factor (that 
corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the 
term of years or the life) in Table B (for a term of years) or in 
Table S (for the life of one individual) in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as 
the case may be, from 1.000000. For information about obtaining 
actuarial factors for other types of term-of-years and life 
interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
(iv) 

Annuities.

 (A) If the interest to be valued is the 
right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the 
end of each year for a term of years or for the life of one 
individual, the present value of the interest is computed by 
multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the 
appropriate annuity actuarial factor (that corresponds to the 
applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period). 
Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes actuarial 
factors in Table B (for an annuity payable for a term of years) 
and in Table S (for an annuity payable for the life of one 
individual). However, annuity actuarial factors are not included 
in Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If 
Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable 
source of annuity actuarial factors) is not conveniently 
available, an annuity factor for a term of years or for one life 
may be derived mathematically. This annuity factor may be 
derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor (that 
corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and 
annuity period) in Table B (in the case of a term-of-years 
annuity) or in Table S (in the case of a one-life annuity) in 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000 and then 
dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate 
expressed as a decimal number. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(2)(iv) of this 
chapter for an example that illustrates the computation of the 
present value of an annuity. 
(B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual, 
quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained by 
multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable 
annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor 
set forth in Table K in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the 
appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the end 
of the specified periods. The provisions of this paragraph 
(d)(2)(iv)(B) are illustrated by the following example: 





Example.

 On July 1, 1989, the donor agrees to pay the 
annuitant the sum of $10,000 per year, payable in equal 
semiannual installments at the end of each period. The 
semiannual installments are to be made on each December 31st and 
June 30th. The annuity is payable until the annuitant's death. 
On July 1, 1989, the annuitant is 68 years and 5 months old. The 
donee annuitant's age is taken as 68 for purposes of computing 
the present value of the retained annuity. The section 7520 rate 
for July 1989 is 10.6 percent. Under Table S, the factor at 10.6 
percent for determining the present value of a remainder interest 
payable at the death of an individual aged 68 is .31371 Converting the remainder factor to an annuity factor, as 
described above, the annuity factor for determining the present 
value of an annuity transferred to an individual age 68 is 6.4744 
(1.00000 minus .31371 divided by 10.6). The adjustment factor 
from Table K in the column for payments made at the end of each 
semiannual period at the rate of 10.6 percent is 1.0258. The 
aggregate annual amount of the annuity, $10,000, is multiplied by 
the factor 6.4744 and the product multiplied by 1.0258. The 
present value of the annuity beneficiary's interest is, 
therefore, $66,414 ($10,000&times;6.4744&times;1.0258).




(C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, 
semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term of 
years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the 
aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity factor described 
in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so 
obtained is then multiplied by the adjustment factor in Table J 
in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the appropriate interest 
rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified 
periods. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, 
semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for one or more 
lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment 
plus the present value of a similar annuity, the first payment of 
which is not to be made until the end of the payment period, 
determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this 
section.

Annuity and unitrust interests for a term of years or until the prior death of an individual

_(A) 

Annuity interests.

 The present value of an annuity interest that is payable until the earlier to occur of the lapse of a specific number
of years or the death of an individual may be computed with values from the tables in 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) as described
in the following example:







Example. 

On January 1, 1991, the donor transfers $100,000 into a trust and retains the right to receive an annuity from the trust
in the amount of $6,000 per year, payable in equal semiannual installments at the end of each period. The semiannual
installments are to be made on each June 30th and December 31st. The annuity is payable for 10 years or until the donor's
prior death. On January 1, 1991, the donor is 59 years and 6 months old. The donor's age is taken as 60 for purposes of computing
the present value of the retained annuity. The section 7520 rate for January 1991 is 9.8 percent. The present value
of the annuity beneficiary's interst is $35,424.00, determined as follows:

Unitrust interests. 

The present value of a unitrust interest that is payable until the earlier to occur of the lapse of a specific number
of years or the death of an individual may be computed with values from the tables in &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) as described
in the following example:









Example. 

The donor who, as of the nearest birthday, is 60 years old transfers $100,000 to a unitrust on January 1, 1991. The trust
instrument requires that each year the trust pay to the donor, in equal semiannual installments on June 30th and December
31st, 6 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets, valued as of January 1st each year, for 10 years or until
the prior death of the donor. The section 7520 rate for January 1991 is 9.8 percent. Under Table F(9.8), the appropriate
adjustment factor is .932539 for semiannual payments payable at the end of the semiannual period. The adjusted payout
rate is 5.595 percent (6% &times; .932539). The present value of the unitrust beneficiary's interest is $40,495.00
determined as follows:

General Actuarial Valuations 


&sect;25.7520&hyph;1 

Valuation of annuities, unitrust interests, interests 
for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary 
interests. 


(a) 

General actuarial valuations.

 (1) Except as otherwise 
provided in this section and in &sect;25.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to 
exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain 
circumstances), in the case of gifts made after April 30, 1989, 
the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or for a 
term of years (including unitrust interests), remainders, and 
reversions is their present value determined under this section. 
See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d) (and, for certain prior periods, &sect;20.2031&hyph;7A) 
of this chapter, Estate Tax Regulations, for the computation of 
the value of annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms 
of years, remainders, and reversions, other than interests 
described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. 
(2) In the case of a gift to a beneficiary of a pooled 
income fund after April 30, 1989, see &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (or, for 
certain prior periods, &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6A) of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations) with respect to the valuation of the remainder 
interest. 
(3) In the case of a gift to a beneficiary of a charitable 
remainder annuity trust after April 30, 1989, see &sect;1.664&hyph;2 of 
this chapter with respect to the valuation of the remainder 
interest. See &sect;1.664&hyph;4 (or, for certain prior periods, &sect;1.664&hyph;4A) of this chapter (Income
Tax Regulations) with respect to the 
valuation of the remainder interest in property transferred to a 
charitable remainder unitrust. 
(b) 

Components of valuation

_(1) 

Interest rate component

_ 
(i) 

Section 7520 Interest rate.

 The section 7520 interest rate 
is the rate of return, rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one 
percent, that is equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal 
mid-term rate, compounded annually, for purposes of section 
1274(d)(1), for the month in which the valuation date falls. In 
rounding the rate to the nearest two-tenths of a percent, any 
rate that is midway between one two-tenths of a percent and 
another is rounded up to the higher of those two rates. For 
example, if 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate 
is 10.30, the section 7520 interest rate component is 10.4. The 
section 7520 interest rate is published monthly by the Internal 
Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See 
&sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter). 
(ii) 

Valuation date.

 Generally, the valuation date is the 
date on which the gift is made. For gift tax purposes, the 
valuation date is the date on which the gift is complete under 
&sect;25.2511&hyph;2. For special rules in the case of charitable 
transfers, see &sect;25.7520&hyph;2. 
(2) 

Mortality component.

 The mortality component reflects 
the mortality data most recently available from the United States 
census. As new mortality data becomes available after each 
decennial census, the mortality component described in this 
section will be revised periodically and the revised mortality 
component tables will be published in the regulations at that 
time. For gifts with valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the 
mortality component table (Table 80CNSMT) is contained in 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations). See 
&sect;20.2031&hyph;7A of this chapter for mortality component tables 
applicable to gifts before May 1, 1989. 
(c) 

Tables.

 The present value on the valuation date of an 
annuity, life estate, term of years, remainder, or reversion is 
computed by using the section 7520 interest rate component that 
is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the 
mortality component that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Actuarial factors for determining these present values 
are included in tables in these regulations and in publications 
by the Internal Revenue Service. If a special factor is required 
in order to value an interest, the Internal Revenue Service will 
furnish the factor upon a request for a ruling. The request for 
a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts, 
including the date of birth for each measuring life and copies of 
relevant instruments. A request for a ruling must comply with 
the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically 
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;1, 1994&hyph;1 
I.R.B. 10, and subsequent updates, and &sect;&sect;601.201 and 
601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include payment of the 
required user fee. 
(1) 

Regulation sections containing tables with interest 
rates between 4.2 and 14 percent.

 Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6(e)(4) of 
this chapter contains Table S used for determining the present 
value of a single life remainder interest in a pooled income fund 
as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations). Section 1.664&hyph;4(e)(6) of this chapter contains 
Table D (actuarial factors used in determining the present value 
of a remainder interest postponed for a term of years), Table 
U(1) (actuarial factors for one life), and Table F (payout 
factors) used in determining the present value of a remainder 
interest in a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter. Section 20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6)
of this chapter 
(Estate Tax Regulations) contains Table S (actuarial factors for 
one life), Table B (actuarial factors used in determining the 
present value of an interest for a term of years), Table K 
(annuity end-of-interval adjustment factors), Table J (term 
certain annuity beginning-of-interval adjustment factors), and 
Table 80CNSMT (mortality components) used in determining the 
present value of annuities, life estates, remainders, and 
reversions. The regulations will be revised periodically to 
include new mortality component tables and new tables of factors. 
(2) 

Internal Revenue Service publications containing tables 
with interest rates between 2.2 and 26 percent.

 The following 
documents (except for Publication 1459) have been published for 
sale by the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402: 
(i) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial 
Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes tables 
of valuation factors, as well as examples that show how to 
compute other valuation factors, for determining the present 
value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and 
reversions, measured by one or two lives. These factors may also 
be used in the valuation of interests in a charitable remainder 
annuity trust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;2 of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations) and a pooled income fund as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5. 
(ii) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial 
Values, Beta Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes term 
certain tables and tables of one and two life valuation factors 
for determining the present value of remainder interests in a 
charitable remainder unitrust as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this 
chapter. 
(iii) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1459, ``Actuarial 
Values, Gamma Volume,'' (8&hyph;89) is no longer available for purchase 
from the Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be 
obtained by requesting a copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS 
Publication 1459), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, 
Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. This publication 
includes tables for computing depreciation adjustment factors.

Effective date.

 This section is effective as of May 1, 
1989. 


&sect;25.7520&hyph;2 

Valuation of charitable interests. 


(a) 

In general

_(1) 

Valuation.

 Except as otherwise provided in this section and 
in &sect;25.7520&hyph;3 (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed 
tables under certain circumstances), the fair market value of 
annuities, interests for life or for a term for years, 
remainders, and reversions for which a gift tax charitable 
deduction is allowable is the present value of such interests 
determined under &sect;25.7520&hyph;1. 
(2) 

Prior-month election rule.

 If any part of the property 
interest transferred qualifies for a gift tax charitable 
deduction under section 2522, the donor may elect to compute the 
present value of the interest transferred by use of the section 
7520 interest rate for the month during which the gift is made or 
the section 7520 interest rate for either of the 2 months 
preceding the month during which the gift is made. Paragraph (b) 
of this section explains how a prior-month election is made. The 
interest rate for the month so elected is the applicable section 
7520 interest rate. If the actuarial factor for either or both 
of the 2 months preceding the month during which the gift is made 
is based on a mortality experience that is different from the 
mortality experience at the date of the gift and if the donor 
elects to use the section 7520 rate for a prior month with the 
different mortality experience, the donor must use the actuarial 
factor derived from the mortality experience in effect during the 
month of the section 7520 rate elected. All actuarial 
computations relating to the gift must be made by applying the 
interest rate component and the mortality component of the month 
elected by the donor. 
(3) 

Gifts of more than one interest in the same property.

 
If a donor makes a gift of more than one interest in the same 
property at the same time, the donor must, for purposes of 
valuing the gifts, use the same interest rate and mortality 
components for the gift of each interest in the property. If the 
donor has made gifts of more than one interest in the same 
property at different times, the donor must determine the value 
of the gift by the use of the interest rate component and 
mortality component in effect during the month of that gift or, 
if applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, either of 
the two months preceding the month of the gift. 
(4) 

Information required with tax return.

 The following 
information must be attached to the gift tax return (or to the 
amended return) if the donor claims a charitable deduction for 
the present value of a temporary or remainder interest in 
property_
(i) A complete description of the interest that is 
transferred, including a copy of the instrument of transfer; 
(ii) The valuation date of the transfer; 
(iii) The names and identification numbers of the 
beneficiaries of the transferred interest; 
(iv) The names and birthdates of any measuring lives, 
a description of any relevant terminal illness condition of 
any measuring life, and (if applicable) an explanation of 
how any terminal illness condition was taken into account in 
valuing the interest; and 
(v) A computation of the deduction showing the applicable 
section 7520 interest rate that is used to value the transferred 
interest. 
(5) 

Place for filing returns.

 See section 6091 of the 
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder for the 
place for filing the return or other document required by this 
section. 
(b) 

Election of interest rate component

_(1) 

Time for making 
election.

 A taxpayer makes a prior-month election under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section by attaching the information 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the donor's gift 
tax return or to an amended return for that year that is filed 
within 24 months after the later of the date the original return 
for the year was filed or the due date for filing the return. 
(2) 

Manner of making election.

 A statement that the prior-month election under section 7520(a) of the Internal Revenue Code 
is being made and that identifies the elected month must be 
attached to the gift tax return (or to the amended return). 
(3) 

Revocability.

 The prior-month election may be revoked 
by filing an amended return within 24 months after the later of 
the date the original return of tax for that year was filed or 
the due date for filing the return. The revocation must be filed 
in the place referred to in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. 
(c) 

Effective dates.

 Paragraph (a) of this section is 
effective as of May 1, 1989. Paragraph (b) of this section is 
effective for elections made after June 10, 1994.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding on a petition to list the bull trout (

Salvelinus confluentus

) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service finds that listing bull trout throughout
its range is not warranted at this time due to unavailable or insufficient data regarding the threats to and status
and population trends of the species within Alaska and Canada. Sufficient information is available, however, to
support a warranted finding to list bull trout within the conterminous United States. The Service, therefore, finds
that listing a distinct vertebrate population segment of bull trout residing in the conterminous United States is
warranted, but precluded due to other higher priority listing actions. The Service continues to seek data and comments
from the public on the status and threats to this species.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that for any petition to list a species as endangered or threatened that presents substantial scientific
or commercial information, a finding must be made within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether
the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from immediate proposal
by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month findings are to be published promptly
in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is warranted but precluded, the Service will, within 12 months of such finding, reevaluate the issue
and again make one of the three findings described above with regard to the petition. 
The bull trout was designated as a category 2 candidate for listing in the conterminous United States in the September
18, 1985, Animal Notice of Review (50 FR 37958). Category 2 species are species for which the Service has some evidence
of vulnerability but for which substantial information is not currently available to support a proposal to list the
species as endangered or threatened. 
On October 30, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the bull trout as an endangered species throughout its
range from the following conservation organizations in Montana: Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Inc., Friends of
the Wild Swan, and Swan View Coalition. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated for the
bull trout concurrently with the listing. They further requested an emergency listing and concurrent critical habitat
designation for bull trout populations in select aquatic ecosystems where the biological information indicates
that the species is in imminent threat of extinction. 
A 90-day petition finding, published May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28849), determined that the petitioners had provided substantial
information indicating that listing of the species may be warranted. The Service initiated a rangewide status review
of the species concurrent with publication of the 90-day finding. The period of the Service's status review was extended
due to insufficient staff. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present
and future threats facing the bull trout. The species historically was widely distributed throughout the major rivers
and tributaries of the Pacific Northwest, including seven States (Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon,
Nevada, and California) and two Canadian Provinces (Alberta and British Columbia). The species has been extirpated
from most of the large mainstem rivers in which it historically occurred. The majority of remaining individuals exist
within headwater streams. These fragmented and isolated populations are subject to local extirpation. 
The species is threatened with extinction within the conterminous United States as a result of aquatic habitat degradation
due to forest management practices, roadbuilding, dams, water diversions, mining, and grazing, as well as from isolation,
competition and hybridization with non-native fishes, and overharvest. Even populations occurring in wilderness
areas, where land use impacts are minimal, are threatened by non-native species and by isolation from other populations
such that stochastic events might, in time, result in extirpation. 
Different amounts of scientific and commercial data are available on the different populations of bull trout throughout
its range. There is little information available regarding the existence or status of bull trout in Alaska. Sufficient
monitoring data to document the possible declining population trend in Canada is not currently available in Service
files. As a result of the Service's status review for this species, the Service finds that listing bull trout throughout
its range is not warranted at this time due to unavailable or insufficient data regarding the threats to and status
and population trends of the species within Alaska and Canada. 
Sufficient information on the biological vulnerability and threats to the species is, however, available to support
a warranted finding to list bull trout within the conterminous United States. The Service has identified a national
interest in preserving species in the conterminous United States, even though they also occur in Canada and Alaska.
Examples of cases where the Service has used an international boundary to define a distinct vertebrate population
segment include: Grizzly bear, bald eagle, marbled murrelet, and woodland caribou. 
On September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43098), the Service published a system for prioritizing species for listing. This system
results in a listing priority number from 1 to 12 (with number 1 as the most threatened). Because of limited staff and
funding, the Service must give priority to the listing of species with a listing priority of 1 through 6. Given the moderate,
yet imminent threats facing bull trout residing in the conterminous United States, the Service assigns the listing
priority number of 9 to this distinct vertebrate population segment. 
Section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act provides that petitioned actions may be found to be warranted, but precluded by
other listing actions when it is found that the Service is making expeditious progress in proposing and listing species
of plants and animals that are imminently and highly threatened.

For the current fiscal year that began on October 1, 1994, the Service is making expeditious progress to propose and
list (within the six conterminous States where bull trout reside), at least 80 plant and animal taxa with listing priority
numbers between 2 and 8. The Service, therefore, finds that listing the distinct vertebrate population segment of
bull trout residing in the conterminous United States is warranted, but precluded due to other higher priority listing
actions. Such species are placed in category 1 of the candidate species list. 
More detailed information regarding the above decisions may be obtained from the Service's Olympia office (see

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations with request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to amend regulations
governing the requirements for non-competing continuation (NCC) discretionary grant awards. The amendments will
eliminate the requirement for recipients to submit an application for NCCs. Instead, the due dates for performance
reports will be adjusted so they may be used to determine whether a recipient has met the criteria for receiving a continuation
award. EDGAR is also amended to clarify the Department's policy for the use of funds that remain unobligated by the
recipient and carried over from one budget period of a project to the next budget period of a project. The action is being
taken to improve the effectiveness, integrity, and efficiency of the grant award process, and to contribute to the
effectiveness and integrity of the grants. Because these changes are procedural, the Secretary is not publishing
these regulations as a proposed rule. However, the Secretary is interested in comments from the public on ways to further
improve the non-competing continuation award process.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Effective Dates:

 These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments. Sections 75.118 and 75.590 will become effective after the information
collection requirements contained in those sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved
by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. If you want to know the effective date
of these regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective
date will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 




Applicability Dates:

 The final regulations published in this document will apply only to those competitions for new grants that will be
awarded on or after October 1, 1994 and that are announced in the 

Federal Register

 on or after June 10, 1994. The Department's Combined Application Notice (CAN) for fiscal year 1995 is published elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 and announces competitions that will be subject to the regulations contained in this document. For those competitions
announced before today's CAN, applicants are subject to the EDGAR regulations as they existed before this regulation
becomes effective regarding what had to be included in an application. 
Recipients that receive initial year awards on the basis of competitions that were conducted under the prior EDGAR
regulation will have to submit a continuation application, as they have in the past, for the first continuation award
made after October 1, 1994. That continuation application must include a complete budget for each of the remaining
budget periods of the project that is equivalent to the budget information that will be required under &sect;75.117
after the effective date of these final regulations. For any continuation awards made after this initial continuation
award, the recipient must submit a performance report, as required by these new regulations, rather than submitting
further continuation applications.

 

COMMENTS:

 Comments must be received on or before August 9, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 To improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for recipients the procedures and requirements
of the Department, the Secretary is amending sections in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations
(EDGAR) on non-competing continuation applications and the use of unobligated funds. 



Background 



In 1993 the Department chartered a Quality Improvement Team for Non-Competing Continuation Grants (the Team). The
Team studied the Department's process for awarding non-competing continuation grants. To conduct its analysis,
the Team collected information from a wide variety of sources within and outside the Department, including flowcharting,
analyzing data from the Department's automated grants management information system, conducting focus groups
and interviews of program and grants staff at all levels in the Department, and benchmarking the grant award processes
with other Federal agencies. The Team developed four options, ranging from retaining the current non-competing
continuation award process (with certain refinements and improvements) to establishing a new process for making
NCC awards. The outline of these options was shared with the public during the data gathering stage of the Team's work.


The public was given the opportunity to comment on improving the process for making non-competing continuation awards
by submitting written comments or presenting testimony at a public meeting. Both the meeting and the invitation to
submit written comments were announced in a notice published by the Department in the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1993 (55 FR 40630). Thirteen written comments were received in response to that request. The Team received
additional comments at a public meeting held on August 18, 1993. 

The information gained from these extensive data gathering activities allowed the Team to identify deficiencies
in the current process on which to base recommendations for modifying and improving the current process. 



Recommendation to Streamline the Non-competing Continuation Award Process 



Based on input from interested parties, both inside and outside the Department, the Team recommended that the Department
make non-competing continuation awards on the basis of acceptable and timely performance reports without requiring
the recipient to submit applications for those awards. The Team's recommendation is consistent with the goals of
the Government Performance and Results Act and the specific recommendations of the National Performance Review
to ``eliminate the continuation application process for budget years within the project period'' and that the process
``be replaced by yearly program progress reports focusing on program outcomes and problems related to program implementation
and service delivery.'' Instead, funding levels for each budget period of a project will be determined at the time
of the initial award.

Changes in funding will be made on an ``as needed'' basis using prior approval standards already in place under 34 CFR
74.105 and 34 CFR 80.30(c). Under these standards and the procedures in &sect;&sect; 74.102 and 80.30(f), a recipient
must seek prior approval for certain changes to a budget and submit the request to the Grants Division of the Grants
and Contracts Service. A request for a change in a recipient's budget should be made at the time that the recipient becomes
aware of the need for the change, whether the change affects the current budget period or any or all future budget periods.


If the change affects the next budget period and the recipient becomes aware of the need for the change at the time that
it submits its performance report, the recipient may submit the request at the time that it submits the performance
report. However, the Secretary notes that submission of proposed budget changes with, or after, the performance
report may delay the recipient's receipt of the continuation award. Any funding of a continuation award, whether
or not made in conjunction with a request for a budget change, is contingent upon the availability of funds. 

Annual awards will be made after approval of performance reports by the program offices. Based on public comment,
it was clear to the Team that recipients understand the importance of providing information about progress of grant
activities but feel that more timely performance reports would be preferable to an annual application timed to meet
the Department's award schedule. Also, there was a perception among recipients that the Non-competing Continuation
process demonstrates an ``enforcement'' mentality on the part of the Federal Government, at the expense of a collaborative
and assisting attitude. Recipients favored a new paradigm whereby performance reporting would be tied more to projects'
reporting on results and performance, and less to the threat of a cut-off in funding (even though extremely rare in
practice). This option was chosen to implement an entirely new paradigm for the NCC award process. 

Continuation funding will be based, as it has in the past, on evidence that the grantee has met the standards for continuation
contained in 34 CFR 75.253. These standards include requirements that Congress appropriate sufficient funds to
continue existing awards, that the grantee make substantial progress toward achieving the objectives of the project
or obtain approval from the Secretary for certain changes to the grant, that continuation of the project is in the best
interests of the Federal Government, and that the grantee submit, as required by &sect;75.118, every report that
it must submit to get the continuation award. This last standard will take on increased importance under the amended
regulations because the continuation award decision_including the decision about whether the grantee has made
substantial progress_will be based entirely on the submission of reports as specified by the Secretary, rather than
on the submission of a continuation award application. Moreover, having recipients submit their performance reports
closer to the date when funding decisions must be made will make the reports more valuable instruments than the previous
continuation applications. Until now, recipients often have been required to submit performance data in continuation
applications before their projects had completed more than a few months of activities. 

The Secretary stresses to recipients the increased importance of performance reports. Because these reports will
be key to the decision to continue funding, recipients will be expected to submit high quality reports. A performance
report must contain the most current performance information specified in EDGAR and any applicable program requirements.
These requirements include an evaluation of the grantee's progress in achieving the objectives of the approved application,
the effectiveness of the project in meeting the purposes of the program under which it was funded, and the effect of
the project on the participants it serves (&sect;75.590); and a discussion of the reasons for slippage if established
goals were not met, and a computation of the cost per unit of output if the output of the project can be quantified (&sect;&sect;74.82(c)
and 80.40(b)). 

If a recipient fails to submit a performance report as directed by the Secretary, the recipient will not receive a continuation
award. See &sect;75.253(a)(3). To merit receipt of a continuation award, the report must demonstrate that a recipient
has made substantial progress in fulfilling the objectives of the grant. The Secretary intends that employees of
the Department will scrutinize these reports closely to ensure that the recipient has, in fact, met this standard.
The Department currently is developing a generic performance report for approval by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB). 

The new process will provide many benefits to recipients. It will free up time previously spent on duplicative processes,
both internal and external. For example, certifications and assurances (

e.g., 

Lobbying; Debarment) must be submitted whenever an entity applies for funds. Since recipients will no longer submit
an application to receive continuation funding, they will no longer be required to resubmit these assurances annually
for the life of the project. The new process for making continuation awards should free up resources for both the recipients
and Department staff that can be reinvested in higher quality project management, technical assistance, and monitoring.




Section-by-Section Analysis 



Section 75.100 is revised to remove references to the application process that will no longer be used to make non-competing
continuation awards. 

Section 75.112 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to require an applicant for a new grant to describe in its application
how, in each budget period of the grant, the applicant plans to meet each objective of the project. 

Section 75.117 is revised to reflect the new procedure for determining the award amounts for all budget periods in
a multi-year grant at the time the initial award is made. The revision ensures that the applicant provides multi-year
budgetary information in its initial application since continuation applications will no longer be required.

<TEXT>
 

Section 75.118 is revised to remove references to items that were formerly required in a continuation application.
The items listed in paragraph (b) of this section are no longer needed because adequate information already will be
provided in the initial application in accordance with the revised &sect;75.117. The performance report now will
become due before the beginning of the continuation award, and will provide the information on which the funding decision
will be made. This section makes clear that a performance report must be submitted, prior to the next budget period,
for all multi-year awards, and that the Secretary will establish the specific due date for submission of the report.
In addition, this section changes any references to ``applicant'' so that it now will refer to the ``recipient'' because
an application will no longer be a part of the continuation award process.
Section 75.232 is revised to incorporate the new procedure under which the Department performs its cost analysis
on the basis of the initial application. The Department does a cost analysis to verify cost data in the detailed budget.
In doing so, it evaluates specific elements of cost, and examines an applicant's proposed costs to determine if they
are necessary, reasonable, and allowable under applicable statutes and regulations.
Section 75.253 is amended to make the performance reports due by the dates set by the Secretary (&sect;75.253(a)).
It is important that recipients understand that performance reports now will be due before the end of the current budget
period because this information will be used in lieu of continuation applications in deciding whether to make continuation
awards. If a recipient fails to submit a performance report as required by these regulations, the Secretary will not
continue funding for the project.
Paragraph (c) of &sect;75.253 also is amended to clarify the Department's policy regarding funds that remain unobligated
by a recipient. The current &sect;75.253(c) states when the Department would reduce the amount of new funds made available
for a continuation award to a recipient. Implicit in the current rule is the policy that the Department would, under
certain circumstances, add the unobligated funds to the amount of new funds made available for a continuation award.
Consistent with this policy, &sect;75.253(c) clearly indicates the circumstances under which the Department will
add the amount of unobligated funds to the amount of new funds made available for a continuation award, as well as the
circumstances under which it will reduce those funds.
Section 75.590 is revised to clarify that the grant recipient's annual evaluation is its performance report. The
current regulation in &sect;75.590 requires a recipient to evaluate the project annually but does not require the
recipient to submit the evaluation to the Department. Under this amended regulation, the criteria for the annual
evaluation required by &sect;75.590 is incorporated into the performance report. In this regard, the revised introduction
to this section now says that a ``recipient shall submit a performance report, or, for the last year of a project, a final
report, that evaluates [the project] at least annually *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This change is designed to make clear
that the performance report required under &sect;75.117, as amended by these regulations, must meet the standards
established in &sect;75.590. These standards require an evaluation of the recipient's progress in achieving the
objectives in its approved application, the effectiveness of the project in meeting the purposes of the program under
which it is funded, and the effect of the project on the participants being served by the project. Under the amended
&sect;&sect;75.590 and 75.117, a recipient will no longer have to submit a continuation application and also prepare
a separate evaluation of the project. Instead, a single performance report, meeting the standards of &sect;75.590
will be submitted. Also, the final report of a project required under &sect;&sect;74.82(b) and 80.40(b) must meet
the standards in &sect;75.590.


Executive Order 12866


These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Department's programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens, specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification


The Secretary certifies that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. For the most part these revisions are adopted to streamline the non-competing continuation
award process and the process of reviewing requests for the use of unobligated funds carried over from one budget period
to the next. The final revisions will not result in major changes in Departmental policy that might have significant
economic impact on small entities. Rather, the effect of these rules is to shift the time when certain information
is provided to the Department and eliminate the need for cumbersome continuation award applications.


Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980


Sections 75.112, 75.117, 75.118 and 75.590 contain information collection requirements. The information collection
requirements for &sect;&sect;75.112 and 75.117 have already been approved under the Office of Management and Budget
control number 1875&hyph;0102.

These regulations affect the following types of entities which are eligible, depending on the individual program,
to apply for discretionary grants: State and local governments, nonprofit institutions, institutions of higher
education, for profit organizations, and individuals. The Department needs the information in the performance
reports to enable the Secretary to determine if the recipient meets the criteria for an additional year of funding.
The performance report enables the Secretary to determine if the recipient has made substantial progress toward
meeting the objectives in its approved application. Substantial progress is one of the requirements for a recipient
to be eligible for continuation funds. Other requirements for continuation are described earlier in this preamble
in the discussion regarding 34 CFR 75.253. The annual reporting burden for these collections of information is estimated
to vary from 13 to 22 hours per response, with an average of 17.5 hours per response for 30,000 respondents, for a total
annual burden of 525,000 hours, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. (44 U.S.C.
3504(h)).
The revisions to &sect;&sect;75.118 and 75.590, have not been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980. The Department of Education will submit a collection submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
for its review of these sections under the law.
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.


Intergovernmental Review


Programs receiving multi-year continuation awards are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and
the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. However, for discretionary grants, the non-competing continuations referred
to in 34 CFR 79.8 will no longer be required. Therefore, the Secretary will notify the recipient that the performance
reports must be submitted for intergovernmental review. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental
partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination
and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.
In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for programs subject to 34 CFR part 75.


Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking


Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) the Secretary may waive proposed rulemaking for rules of agency procedure. These procedural
regulations do not affect the substantive rights of recipients to receive new or continuation awards. The procedures
established in these regulations merely reduce and shift burden regarding budget submissions and financial and
performance reports. Therefore, the Secretary has decided to waive proposed rulemaking for these procedural regulations
so that they may be used in the upcoming funding cycle to inform applicants for new awards what must be included in the
application for a new award.
Regarding the amendment to 34 CFR 75.253(c), this amendment merely restates the longstanding current regulation
in clearer language. The Department has interpreted the current 34 CFR 75.253 consistent with the language contained
in the revised paragraph 75.253(c). 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) also provides that an agency may waive proposed rulemaking
for interpretative rules. Because the amendment to 34 CFR 75.253(c) is consistent with current interpretation of
the existing 34 CFR 75.253(c), the Secretary has decided to waive proposed rulemaking regarding this provision as
well. Accordingly, the Secretary waives proposed rulemaking for the amendments to 34 CFR part 75 made in this final
rulemaking document.


Invitation To Comment


The amendments to these regulations are procedural in nature and intended to streamline discretionary grants administration.
However, interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these final regulations
because the Department is always interested in ways it can further improve its discretionary grant management practices.
All comments submitted will be considered in further streamlining and refining procedures for processing non-competing
continuation awards and requests for the use of funds that remain unobligated by the recipient and are carried over
to the next budget period. All comments submitted in response to these final regulations will be available for public
inspection, during and after the comment period, in room 3636, Regional Office Building No. 3, Seventh and D Streets
SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.


Assessment of Educational Impact


The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the final regulations in this document would require transmission
of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the Notices section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is granting an administrative exception to the general prohibition on early entry into pesticide treated areas
for hand labor contained in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). That exception allows, for a 2-year period, under specified conditions, early entry
by workers to harvest greenhouse-grown cut roses. To ensure that the regulated community is aware of that and future
administrative exceptions to the early-entry prohibition, EPA is amending the WPS to add a new &sect;170.122(e)(7)
that allows the regulated community to locate 

Federal Register

 notices that set forth the terms and conditions of the administrative exceptions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background and Purpose


EPA issued the WPS on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 38102, 40 CFR Part 170). The WPS includes a prohibition (&sect;170.112)
against routine early entry into pesticide treated areas to perform hand labor tasks during restricted-entry intervals
(referred to as ``early entry''). Section 170.112(e) of the WPS provides a process for EPA to consider and grant administrative
exceptions to this prohibition on early entry. In the Notice section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is granting the first such administrative exception for early entry to harvest cut roses. To ensure that the regulated
community is aware of, and able to locate, that and future administrative exceptions, EPA is amending &sect;170.112
by adding a new paragraph (e)(7) identifying the 

Federal Register

 citations and effective dates for administrative exceptions granted under &sect;170.112(e).
The addition of paragraph (e)(7) to &sect;170.112 is a technical amendment. It does not make any substantive changes
in the WPS or &sect;170.112. Accordingly, EPA finds that there is good cause to make this amendment effective without
notice and opportunity for public comment because they are unnecessary. Under &sect;170.112(e), EPA provides notice
and an opportunity for comment on proposed administrative exceptions. There is no need for separate comment on adding
a cross-reference to &sect;170.112(e) to those published exception decisions. In addition, EPA finds that there
is good cause to make this technical amendment effective immediately upon publication so that reference to the cut
rose administrative exception, which is itself effective immediately in this 

Federal Register

, will appear in the CFR immediately.


II. Regulatory Assessment Requirements


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51835, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the requirements of the Executive
Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this technical amendment is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 650(b)), EPA has determined that this technical amendment will not
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses since the technical amendment makes no substantive
changes in the WPS.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


This technical amendment contains no information collection requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction
Act (44 U.S.C. 3502 et seq.).


List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 170
