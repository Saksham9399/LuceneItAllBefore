<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;013P]</RINDOCK>



Fee Increase for Inspection Services



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection,
identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. The proposed fee increases
reflect the increased costs of providing these services due primarily to the increase in salaries of Federal employees
allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments must be received on or before: July 27, 1994.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Send written comments to the Policy Evaluation and Planning Staff, Attention: Diane Moore, FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room
3171, South Agriculture Building, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington,
DC 20250&hyph;3700. Oral comments as provided under the Poultry Products Inspection Act should be directed to Mr.
William L. West, (202) 720&hyph;3367. (See also ``Comments'' under Supplementary Information.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Executive Order 12866



This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The proposed fee increases reflect the increased costs of
providing certain inspection services due primarily to an increase in salaries of Federal employees allocated by
Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Since FSIS is required to recover the reimbursable
portion of the increase in employee salaries, FSIS is only providing a 30-day comment period for this proposed rule.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is intended
to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its
provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect unless so specified in the 

EFFECTIVE DATE

 section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions, all applicable administrative procedures
must be exhausted. Under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts, the administrative procedures are
set forth in 7 CFR part 1.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).
The fees provided for in this document reflect only a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities
which elect to utilize certain inspection services.



Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposal. Written comments should be
sent to the Policy Evaluation and Planning Staff and should refer to docket number 94&hyph;013P. Any person desiring
an opportunity for oral presentation of views as provided under the Poultry Products Inspection Act must make such
request to Mr. West so that arrangements may be made for such views to be presented. A record will be made of all views
orally presented. All comments submitted in response to this proposal will be available for public inspection in
the Policy Office from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.



Background



Mandatory inspection by Federal inspectors of meat and poultry slaughtered and/or processed at official establishments
is provided for under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

). Such inspection is required to ensure the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and poultry products;
the ordinary costs of inspection are borne by the U.S. Government. However, costs for these inspection services performed
on holidays or on an overtime basis may be incurred to accommodate the business needs of particular establishments.
All of these costs which are not a part of the mandatory inspection service are recoverable by the Government.

Each year the fees for certain services rendered to operators of official meat and poultry establishments, importers,
or exporters by FSIS are reviewed and a cost analysis is performed to determine if such fees are adequate to recover
the cost of providing the services.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The analysis relates to fees changed in connection with overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection,
identification, certification, or laboratory services. The proposed new fees discussed below were determined
by an analysis of data on the current cost of these services and by increases in costs due primarily to an increase in
the salaries of Federal employees allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990
which provided an average FSIS locality pay raise of 3.2 percent in January 1994. Other increases affecting Federal
employees, such as costs for benefits, are due to the increasing number of employees covered by the Federal Employees
Retirement System in 1994 which is subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, and increased health
insurance costs. Based on the Agency's analysis of the costs in providing these services, FSIS is proposing to increase
the fees relating to overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification, certification and
laboratory services.

9 CFR 307.5 of the Federal meat inspection regulations provides that FSIS shall be reimbursed for the cost of meat inspection
on holidays or on an overtime basis at the rate specified in 9 CFR 391.3, currently $30.72 per hour, per program employee.
Similarly, 9 CFR 381.38 of the poultry products inspection regulations provides that FSIS shall be reimbursed for
the cost of poultry inspection on holidays or on an overtime basis at the rate specified in 9 CFR 391.3, currently $30.72
per hour, per program employee. FSIS is proposing to increase the fee set forth in section 391.3 to $31.80 per hour,
per program employee.

FSIS also provides a range of voluntary inspection and certification services (9 CFR 350.7, 351.8, 351.9, 352.5,
354.101, 355.12, and 362.5); the costs of which are totally recoverable by the Government. These services, provided
under Subchapter B_Voluntary Inspection and Certification Service_are provided under the Agricultural Marketing
Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 

et seq

.) to assist in the orderly marketing of various animal products and byproducts not subject to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act.

The base time rate for providing voluntary inspection and certification services is currently $29.84 per hour, per
program employee, as specified in 9 CFR 391.2. The overtime and holiday rate for voluntary inspection services is
currently $30.72 per hour, per program employee, as specified in 9 CFR 391.3. As stated above, these fees would be increased
to $31.12 per hour and $31.80 per hour, per program employee, respectively.

The rate for laboratory services is currently $51.80 per hour, per program employee, as specified in 9 CFR 391.4. FSIS
is proposing to increase the fee set forth in section 391.4 to $52.04 per hour, per program employee.

Petitions for Rulemaking



Docket No.: 27371

Petitioner: Gerald A. Silver

Regulations Affected: 14 CFR 91.119

Description of Rulechange Sought:



To strike out the following language in subsection (d) of &sect;91.119: ``(d) 

Helicopters.

 Helicopters may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the operation
is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.'' Mr. Silver, on behalf of Homeowners of Encino,
proposes to add the following language in place of that deleted above: ``(d) 

Helicopters.

 Helicopters operated by any municipal, county, state, or federal authority for emergency services, rescue operations,
police or fire protection, may be operated at less than the minimum prescribed in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section
if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.''




Petitioners's Reasons for the Request:



The petitioner(s) feels that the helicopter noise problem, created by low flying helicopters overflying his/their
community conducting sightseeing tours (particularly at night), real estate caravan flybys to show homes to prospective
customers, and other short distance business travel, is a flagrant abuse of the constituency represented by the petitioner(s).
It is a recurring problem that has not been, heretofore, relieved by means of a pilot/industry cooperative endeavor;
and the proposed rulemaking change would provide acceptable relief.




Docket No.: 27736

Petitioner: City of Santa Monica

Sections of the FAR Affected: 14 CFR 91.119(d)

Description of Rulechange Sought:



To require that, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, helicopters operated over a congested area maintain
an altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft; helicopters
operated over non-congested areas would be required to maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the surface; and helicopters
operated over open water or sparsely populated areas would not be permitted closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel,
vehicle, or structure.




Petitioner's Reason for the Request:



The petitioner feels this change will increase the safety of helicopter operations by raising the altitude that they
fly; provide the Federal Aviation Administration greater authority to enforce minimum safe altitude regulations
similar to the provisions for all other aircraft; not unduly burden helicopter operators with increased costs or
loss of efficiency; and minimize the intrusion of helicopters in the community.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of withdrawal. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document withdraws proposed amendments to the 
Customs Regulations which would have provided that a person, having received written notice from a Customs official
of the Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number for imported merchandise, must provide that
designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms. The proposed amendments
also would have provided that a failure to furnish the required designation may subject the person to a claim for monetary
penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592. In view of the subsequent enactment of Customs modernization legislation which amended
the statutes upon which the published proposals were based, those proposals are now outdated and therefore should
be withdrawn.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On September 28, 1987, Customs published a document in the 

 Federal Register

 (52 FR 36279) proposing to amend &sect;141.61(e), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.61(e)) to provide that an importer
or customs broker, having received any of several specified types of written notice from a Customs official of the
Customs designation of the duty/statistical reporting number applicable to imported merchandise (or, in the case
of a broker, where the broker has actual knowledge that his importer-client received such notice), must provide that
designation to Customs on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) or other applicable forms filed by the importer or
broker. In addition, &sect;141.61(e) would have been amended to provide that a failure to provide the required designation
may subject the importer or broker to a claim for monetary penalty under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 1592). The document also proposed to amend &sect;177.8, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.8), by adding
thereto a cross-reference to the requirements in subpart E of part 141 relating to presentation of entry papers. 
In support of the proposed regulatory amendments, Customs noted at that time that: (1) Section 484(a)(1)(B), Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(1)(B)), required that an importer of record file with Customs documentation
to, among other things, enable a Customs officer to properly assess duties on imported merchandise, collect accurate
statistics, and determine whether any other applicable requirement of law is met; and (2) section 500, Tariff Act
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1500), placed the obligation on Customs to ``ascertain the classification and rate
of duty applicable to [imported] merchandise.'' Customs further pointed out that because of substantial increases
in annual import volume and as a result of the development of the Automated Commercial System (ACS), more accurate
reporting data had become necessary and Customs had to place increased reliance upon information contained in entry
documents. Thus, the proposed regulatory amendments, if adopted as a final rule, would have enabled Customs to better
carry out its statutory duty under 19 U.S.C. 1500 and would have assisted Customs in establishing one of the levels
of culpability necessary to constitute a violation under 19 U.S.C. 1592 in appropriate cases. 
As a result of the subsequent adoption of Customs modernization legislation (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182,
107 Stat. 2057, 2170), the legal basis for the proposals set forth in the published document has been altered somewhat.
In this regard Customs notes that, in furtherance of the principle of informed compliance, sections 637 and 638 of
Public Law 103&hyph;182 amended 19 U.S.C. 1484 and 1500, 

inter alia, 

by shifting, from Customs to the importer of record, the legal responsibility for initially valuing, classifying
and determining the rate of duty applicable to imported merchandise and by imposing on the importer of record a ``reasonable
care'' standard in carrying out that responsibility. 



Since the published proposals have become outdated by virtue of the statutory changes described above, Customs believes
it is preferable at this time to withdraw them. Customs intends to look at this matter further in connection with the
overall review of the Customs Regulations for purposes of implementing the Customs modernization provisions, with
a view to possible publication of new proposals for public comment at a future date. Until any such further public notice
procedures are concluded, Customs will enforce existing statutory and regulatory requirements in this matter on
a case-by-case basis.

Establishment of advisory committee.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As required by Section 9(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., the Department of the Interior
(Department) is giving notice of the establishment of the Federal Gas Valuation Negotiated Rulemaking Committee
(Committee) to develop specific recommendations with respect to Federal gas valuation pursuant to its responsibilities
imposed by the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, 30 U.S.C. 1701 

et seq

. (FOGRMA). The Department has determined that the establishment of this Committee is in the public interest and will
assist the Agency in performing its duties under FOGRMA. Copies of the Committee's charter will be filed with the appropriate
committees of Congress and the Library of Congress in accordance with section 9(c) of FACA.

Ms. Deborah Gibbs Tschudy, Chief, Valuation and Standards Division, Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management
Program, P.O. Box 25165, MS&hyph;3920, Denver, Colorado, 80225&hyph;0165, telephone number (303) 275&hyph;7200,

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Through an informal study group, MMS has conducted discussions to receive input on the current gas market and identify
the challenges facing royalty valuation of gas produced from Federal leases for royalty purposes. The discussions
have gone well and needs for regulatory changes have been identified. The MMS now believes that using a negotiated
rulemaking committee to make specific recommendations with respect to Federal gas valuation would help the agency
in developing a rulemaking. The Department is, therefore, establishing the Federal Gas Valuation Negotiated Rulemaking
Committee.



Background



Since the publication of the March 1, 1988, gas valuation regulations (30 CFR Part 206) many of MMS's constituents
have expressed concern about the current ``tracing method'' of valuing production from unit and communization agreements.
Of particular concern is determining the proper value, for royalty purposes, when the working interest owner sells
none of the production allocated to him under the agreement. Likewise, constituents have pointed out difficulties
with the current benchmark system utilized to value non-arm's-length and no-sales situations. Those difficulties
include issues of comparability, certainty, and access to information. As part of Vice President Gore's National
Performance Review (NPR), the Royalty Management Program recently initiated a Reinvention Laboratory Team to examine
ways to streamline the royalty management process. One of the recommendations of that team was to improve the valuation
benchmark system. The NPR Team recommended to the Royalty Management Advisory Committee (RMAC) that a pilot be conducted
to evaluate the use of spot prices as the second benchmark.

In commenting on the recommendations of the NPR Team, RMAC recommended that the entire benchmark system be evaluated
and that the evaluation be limited to gas produced from Federal leases.



Statutory Provisions



Pursuant to FOGRMA (30 U.S.C. 1701 

et seq

.), 30 CFR Part 206 (1993) and Federal oil and gas lease and agreement terms, certain principles of royalty accounting
will form the basis for a proposed rule:

Volume: Royalties must be paid each month on the volume of production allocated to or produced from the Federal lease
under the agreement terms.

Royalty Rate: Royalties must be paid in accordance with the royalty rate specified in each lease unless specified
otherwise under the terms of the agreement.

Value of Production: Value should be determined at the time of production. Value should be based on the fair market
value at the lease.

Payment Responsibility: Federal lessees or their working interest owners are ultimately responsible for paying
royalties, but other entities can be assigned the royalty payment responsibility.



The Committee and Its Process



During the winter and spring of 1994, MMS met with representatives of the oil and gas industry and States to receive
input about the current gas market and identify regulatory changes needed to add certainty and simplicity to valuation,
for royalty purposes, of gas produced from Federal leases in a new gas market. An informal study group format was used
to obtain and clarify varying viewpoints. The materials received to date during the input sessions are available
for inspection and copying at the address referenced above for Ms. Deborah Gibbs Tschudy.

Members of the study group include representatives of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Council of Petroleum
Accountants Societies (COPAS), the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association (RMOGA), the Independent Petroleum Association
of America (IPAA), the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), the Natural Gas Supply Association
(NGSA), an independent marketer, and representatives of the States of Utah, North Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico.
The MMS and the study group participants believe that the input sessions have been mutually beneficial. As a result,
MMS now believes it would be appropriate for the study group to transform itself and make specific regulatory recommendations
for implementing a rulemaking regarding Federal gas valuation. The Department is therefore establishing the Federal
Gas Valuation Negotiated Rulemaking Committee.

The recently enacted Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;648) contemplates a ``convening'' process
which involves identifying the potential parties and issues, publishing a notice of intent to form a committee, waiting
30 days for comments to be submitted responding to the notice, and only then proceeding with the establishment of the
committee provided it meets the criteria of the Act. In this case, the study group process has served the same function
as the convening_parties that would be significantly affected and the issues in controversy have been identified.
The study group's discussions have also enabled the MMS to determine that the criteria for negotiated rules, as spelled
out in the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, are met for this rule:
&bull;The rule is needed, since royalty payors are not able to comply with the current regulations particularly in
the current gas market.
&bull;A limited number of identifiable interests will be significantly affected by the rule. Those parties are oil
and gas companies who produce gas and pay royalties on Federal leases and States who receive royalties from gas produced
from Federal leases located in their State.
&bull;Representatives can be selected to adequately represent these interests, as reflected above.
&bull;The interests are willing to negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach a consensus on a proposed rule.
&bull;There is a reasonable likelihood that the Committee will reach consensus on a proposed rule within a reasonable
time. This determination has been made based on discussions of the study group, and hence is built on the developments
to date.
&bull;The use of the negotiation will not delay the development of the rule if time limits are placed on the negotiation.
Indeed, its use will expedite both development and ultimate acceptance of the rule.
The Department is not proposing to issue a separate notice of intent to form a negotiated rulemaking committee for
this rule. Given the evolution of this committee, the publication of such a notice would only show down the rulemaking
process and the functions of the notice of intent have either already been met or are provided for in this notice. Moreover,
the Negotiated Rulemaking Act specifically provides that its provisions are not mandatory.
The Negotiated Rulemaking Act does anticipate an outreach to ensure that people who were not contacted during the
convening process can come forward to explain why they believe they would be significantly affected and yet are not
represented on the Committee or to argue why they believe the rule should not be negotiated. The MMS believes that the
interests who would be significantly affected by this rule are represented by the informal study group already in
place which includes representatives from API, COPAS, RMOGA, IPAA, IPAMS, NGSA, an independent marketer, and the
states of Utah, Montana, North Dakota, and New Mexico. If anyone believes that their interests are not adequately
represented by these organizations, they must demonstrate and document that assertion through an application submitted
no later than 10 calendar days following publication of this notice. You may fax your documentation to (303) 275&hyph;7227.

Summary of Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. In this notice, the Commission invites further comments on its proposal to reexamine and revise the criteria used
to select among applicants for new broadcast facilities, set forth in 

Reexamination of the Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings

 57 FR 14683 (Apr. 22, 1992).

2. Numerous commenters, who responded to the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking, stated their views as to
(1) Whether the existing comparative criteria should be modified or eliminated; (2) whether the new criteria should
be adopted; and (3) whether the Commission should adopt a point system with a tie-breaker to decide comparative cases.
These comments are currently under consideration.

3. During this consideration, on December 17, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit issued a ruling that the integration criterion was arbitrary and capricious and therefore invalid. 

Bechtel

 v. 

FCC

, 10 F. 3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In light of the court's decision, the Commission must eliminate integration as a criterion
in the comparative evaluation.

4. The Commission believes that this proceeding provides an appropriate means of reassessing the comparative standards
in light of 

Bechgtel.

 The Commission finds it desirable, in resolving this proceeding, to have comments specifically addressing the impact
of 

Bechtel

 on the relevant issues for pending and future cases.

5. In particular, the Commission seeks comments on: (1) The nature of the criteria that should be employed in light
of 

Bechtel

, and the weight different factors should be given; (2) the procedural ramifications of applying a revised comparative
analysis to pending cases; and (3) how any proposed revision of the comparative criteria could be structured to satisfy
the kind of concerns expressed in 

Bechtel.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes endangered species status pursuant to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant 

Delissea undulata

 (No Common Name). This species is known only from one individual, located on the island of Hawaii. The greatest immediate
threats to the survival of this species are habitat degradation and predation by domestic and feral mammals, fire,
and competition with alien plants. The small population size of one individual with its limited gene pool also comprises
a serious threat to this species. This proposal, if made final, would implement the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act.

Background 





Delissea undulata

 was first described by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre from specimens he collected in the Hawaiian Islands (``Isles
Sandwich'') in 1819 (St. John 1959). He chose the specific epithet to refer to the undulating margins of the leaves.
F.E. Wimmer named a specimen J.F. Rock collected in 1911 from Kanahaha, Kona, as 

Cyanea arqutidenta,

 which H. St. John later moved to the genus 

Delissea

 (St. John 1959, Wimmer 1943). St. John also named a specimen collected in 1968 from the southern Kona District as 

D. konaensis

 (St. John 1986). The current treatment of the family (Lammers 1988, 1990) considers all of the above species to be synonymous
with 

D. undulata.

 Lammers recognizes three subspecies of 

D. undulata:

 subsp. 

niihauensis,

 subsp. 

kauaiensis,

 and subsp. 

undulata

 (Lammers 1988, 1990). 



Delissea undulata

 of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is a palm-like tree with unbranched woody stems 2 to 10 meters (m) (6 to 30
feet (ft)) tall. The leaves are long and narrow or elliptic with long petioles and undulate or flat, toothed margins,
about 5 to 21 centimeters (cm) (2 to 8 inches (in)) long and 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) wide. The flowering stalk bears 5 to 20 greenish-white,
slightly down-curved flowers 1.6 to 2.5 cm (0.6 to 1.0 in) long with one or two small knobs on the upper surfaces. The
fruits are ovoid to globose purple berries 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in) long. The three subspecies of 

D. undulata

 can be distinguished from each other by leaf shape and leaf margin characteristics: subsp. 

kauaiensis

 has ovate leaves with flat, sharply toothed margins; subsp. 

niihauensis

 has leaves with heart-shaped bases and shallow roundly toothed margins; and subsp. 

undulata

 has narrower, lance-shaped leaves with undulating margins and spreading, pointed teeth (Lammers 1988, 1990). The
species 

D. undulata

 is distinguished from closely related species in this genus by its broader leaf bases, larger flowers, and larger
berries (Lammers 1990). 

Historically, 

D. undulata

 is known from Niihau, Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. Subspecies 

kauaiensis

 was collected west of the Hanapepe River on the island of Kauai by A.A. Heller in 1895 and has not been relocated (Hawaii
Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a, Heller 1897, Lammers 1988). Subspecies 

niihauensis

 was collected twice in the 1800's on the island of Niihau and has not been located since (HHP 1991b, Hillebrand 1888,
St. John 1959). Both of these subspecies are considered extinct (HHP 1991a, 1991b; Lammers 1990). 

Delissea undulata

 subsp. 

undulata

 was reported from four valleys of southwestern Maui in the 1800's, and from the Kona region of the island of Hawaii (HHP
1991c1 to 1991c9). This subspecies was observed in 1971 at Puu Lehua and was subsequently thought to be extinct (HHP
1991c6, Lammers 1990). However, one individual plant was discovered on April 24, 1992, at Puu Waawaa, at a previously
unreported location on Hualalai on the island of Hawaii (Jon Giffin, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources
(Hawaii DLNR), 

in litt.

 1993). 



Delissea undulata

 grows primarily in dry and mesic forests at about 1,000 to 1,750 m (3,300 to 5,700 ft) elevation (Lammers 1990; J. Giffin,


in litt.

, 1993). The substrate is a thin organic soil layer over 'a'a or pahoehoe lava (Department of Geography 1983). The only
known individual grows on the brink of a collapsed lava tube at 1070 m (3520 ft) elevation. The vegetation is open 

Sophora chrysophylla

 (mamane)-

Metrosideros polymorpha

 ('ohia) forest with such associated species as 

Santalum ellipticum

 ('iliahi) and 

Acacia koa

 (koa). The endangered species 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

 ('aiea) also is found in the area of the one remaining individual of 

D. undulata.

 Introduced plants in the area include 

Pennisetum clandestinum

 (kikuyu grass), 

Passiflora mollissima

 (banana poka), and 

Senecio mikanioides

 (German ivy) (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993). 

The greatest immediate threats to the survival of 

D. undulata

 are damage from domestic and feral herbivores and competition with alien plants. Fire, whether started naturally
or by arson, poses a serious threat to the population. The small population size of one individual with its limited
gene pool also comprises a serious threat to this species (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993).

Previous Federal Action 



Federal action on this species began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January
9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of
the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In this and subsequent
notices, 

D. undulata

 var. 

undulata

 was included as extinct, and 

D. undulata

 var. 

argutidenta

 was included as endangered. As a result of this review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the


Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including 

D. undulata

, endangered pursuant to section 4 of the Act. In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years
old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service
published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) of the withdrawal of that portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with
four other proposals that had expired. 

The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480), including 

D. undulata

 as a category 1 candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that a listing proposal
was appropriate. In the updated Notice of Review for plants on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990
(55 FR 6183), 

D. undulata

 was included as a Category 1* candidate, meaning that the Service had substantial information indicating that this
taxon was vulnerable in the recent past but may already have become extinct. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the 1982 amendments
to the Act, requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt.
Section 2(b)(1) of the 
1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. The latter was the case for 

D. undulata

 because the Service had accepted the 1975 Smithsonian report as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found
that the listing of the species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding
requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October
of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. Publication of the present proposal constitutes the final
1-year finding. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set
forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened
species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to


Delissea undulata

 Gaud. (No Common Name) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



The habitat of 

Delissea undulata

 has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including deliberate and
accidental alien mammal and plant introductions and agricultural development. Natural disturbances such as the
collapse of lava tubes also destroy habitat and can have a significant effect on small populations of plants. Competition
with alien plants as well as destruction of individuals and modification of habitat by introduced animals are the
primary threats facing this species. 

Beginning with Captain James Cook in 1792, early European explorers introduced livestock, which became feral, increased
in number and range, and caused significant changes to the natural environment of Hawaii. The 1848 provision for land
sales to individuals allowed large-scale agricultural and ranching ventures to begin. Land was cleared for these
enterprises to such a great extent that climatic conditions began to change and the amount and distribution of rainfall
were altered (Wenkam 1969). 

Past and present impacts of introduced alien animals are the primary factor in altering and degrading vegetation
and habitats on the island of Hawaii as well as on Kauai and Maui, where populations of 

D. undulata

 previously existed. Feral ungulates trample and eat native vegetation and disturb open areas. This causes erosion
and allows the invasion of alien plant species (Cuddihy and Stone, 1990, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 

Delissea undulata

 is threatened by habitat degradation resulting from introduced ungulates (e.g., cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs).
Habitat degradation by these ungulates threatens the only known individual plant, any potential natural germination
of seedlings, as well as potential suitable habitat occurring throughout the historic range of the species.

Cattle (

Bos taurus

), native to Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern Asia, were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1793. Large
feral herds developed as a result of restrictions on killing cattle decreed by King Kamehameha I. Large ranches in
the tens of thousands of acres were created on Maui and Hawaii. Much of the land used in these private enterprises was
leased from the State or was privately owned. Feral cattle formerly existed on Maui and damaged the forests there.
Feral cattle are presently found on the island of Hawaii, and ranching is still a major commercial activity there.
Cattle eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, create disturbed areas into which alien
plants invade, and spread seeds of alien plants in their feces and on their bodies. The forest becomes degraded to grassland
pasture in areas grazed by cattle, and plant cover is reduced for many years following removal of cattle from an area.
Several alien grasses and legumes purposely introduced for cattle forage have become noxious weeds (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990, Tomich 1986). Cattle have altered and degraded the vegetation of much of Hawaii, including the areas where


D. undulata

 may have formerly grown, and where it is still known to exist (Tomich 1986; J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993). Hunting of feral cattle is no longer allowed in Hawaii (Hawaii DLNR 1985). 

Goats (

Capra hircus

), native to the Middle East and India, were successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792, and currently
there are populations on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. On Kauai, feral goats have been present in drier,
more rugged areas since 1820; they still occur in Waimea Canyon. On Hawaii, goats damage low elevation dry forest,
montane parkland, subalpine woodlands, and alpine grasslands. Goats are managed in Hawaii as a game animal, but many
herds populate inaccessible areas where hunting has little effect on their numbers. Goat hunting is allowed year-round
or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR n.d., 1985). Goats browse on introduced grasses and native
plants, especially in drier and more open ecosystems. They also trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote
the invasion of alien plants. They are able to forage in extremely rugged terrain and have a high reproductive capacity
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988, Tomich 1986). 

Delissea undulata

 currently is threatened by goats that use the area where the single known individual exists (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993). 

Sheep (

Ovis aries

) became firmly established on the island of Hawaii (Tomich 1986) following their introduction almost 200 years ago
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Like feral goats, sheep roam the upper elevation dry forests, including Puu Waawaa, causing
damage similar to that of goats (Stone 1985). Sheep have decimated vast areas of native forest and shrubland on Hawaii.
Sheep threaten the habitat of 

D. undulata

 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990; J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993) as well as individual plants. 

Pigs (

Sus scrofa

) are originally native to Europe, northern Africa, Asia Minor, and Asia. European pigs, introduced to Hawaii by Captain
James Cook in 1778, became feral and invaded forested areas, especially wet and mesic forests and dry areas at high
elevations. They currently are present on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii and inhabit rain forests and grasslands.
Pig hunting is allowed on all islands either year-round or during certain months, depending on the area (Hawaii DLNR
n.d., 1985). While rooting in the ground in search of the invertebrates and plant material they eat, feral pigs disturb
and destroy vegetative cover, trample plants and seedlings, and threaten forest regeneration by damaging seeds
and seedlings. They disturb soil substrates and cause erosion, especially on slopes. Alien plant seeds are dispersed
in their hooves and coats as well as through their digestive tracts, and the disturbed soil is fertilized by their feces,
helping these plants to establish (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985, Stone 1985, Tomich 1986, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Feral pigs pose a threat to 

D. undulata

 and its habitat (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993). 



B. Overutilization For Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to 

Delissea undulata,

 which is represented by only one known individual. The species is of some horticultural and ornamental interest.
Taking and vandalism are potential threats that could result from increased specific publicity. 



C. Disease or Predation



Cattle, goats, pigs, and sheep have been reported in the area where 

Delissea undulata

 is known to occur. As this taxon is not known to be unpalatable to these ungulates, predation is a probable threat where
these animals have been reported. The lack of seedlings and the occurrence of the only known individual in an area less
accessible to ungulates seem to indicate the effect that browsing mammals, especially cattle, have had in restricting
the distribution of this plant. Though not legally obligated to protect the species, the State fenced the one individual
to protect it from further damage by ungulates (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993). See Factor D. 

Of the four species of rodents which have been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, the species with the greatest impact
on the native flora and fauna is probably the roof or black rat (

Rattus rattus

), which now occurs on all the main Hawaiian Islands around human habitations, in cultivated fields, and in dry to wet
forests. Roof rats, and to a lesser extent house mouse (

Mus musculus

), Polynesian rat (

R. exulans

), and Norway rat (

R. norvegicus

) eat the fruits of some native plants, especially those with large, fleshy fruits. Many native Hawaiian plants produce
their fruit over an extended period of time, and this produces a prolonged food supply which supports rodent populations.
It is probable that rats damage the fleshy fruit of 

D. undulata.

 Introduced game birds also may eat the fruits (J. Giffin, 

in litt.

, 1993).

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 


The only known population of 

Delissea undulata

 occurs on State land. The species is not presently listed as an endangered species by the State of Hawaii. Therefore
no State regulatory protection is in effect for this species. State laws relating to the conservation of biological
resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs concerning
the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)). Hawaii's Endangered Species Act states,
``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant
to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''
(HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). Federal listing would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii State law, which
prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4).
The State also may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required for the conservation,
management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)). If listing were to occur,
funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative Agreements).

Conservation district lands (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4) are regarded, among other purposes, as necessary for the protection
of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Requests
for amendments to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies
and private landowners (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is mandated
to initiate changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora
and fauna within the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5.1). Hawaii environmental policy, and thus
approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;the State's unique natural environmental
characteristics .&blank;.&blank;.'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``protect endangered
species of individual plants and animals&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). Federal
listing, because it automatically invokes State listing, would also trigger these other State regulations protecting


D. undulata.

 Federal listing as endangered would offer additional protection to this species since it would be a violation of the
Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction
in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. 


E. Other Natural Or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence 


The fact that there is only one remaining individual of 

Delissea undulata

 increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor,
or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy the only known extant individual. This
constitutes a major threat to 

D. undulata.

 
Natural changes to habitat and substrate can result in the death of individual plants as well as the destruction of
their habitat. This especially affects the continued existence of taxa or populations with limited numbers and/or
narrow ranges and is often exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices (See Factor A). Additional collapse
of the lava tube where the only known individual of 

D. undulata

 occurs is a potential threat to this species (J. Giffin, 

in litt.,

 1993).

Three species of introduced plants threaten 

D. undulata.

 The historic native flora of Hawaii consisted of about 1,000 species, 89 percent of which were endemic. Of the total
native and naturalized Hawaiian flora of 1,817 species, 47 percent were introduced from other parts of the world and
nearly 100 species have become pests (Smith 1985, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Naturalized, introduced species degrade the Hawaiian landscape and compete with native plants for space,
light, water, and nutrients (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Some of these species were brought to Hawaii by various groups
of people, including the Polynesian immigrants, for food or cultural reasons. Plantation owners, alarmed at the
reduction of water resources for their crops caused by the destruction of native forest cover by grazing feral animals,
supported the introduction of alien tree species for reforestation. Ranchers intentionally introduced pasture
grasses and other species for agriculture, and sometimes inadvertently introduced weed seeds as well. Other plants
were brought to Hawaii for their potential horticultural value (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wenkam 1969). 


Passiflora mollissima

 (banana poka), a woody vine, poses a serious problem to mesic forests on Kauai and Hawaii by covering trees, reducing
the amount of light that reaches trees as well as understory, and causing damage and death to trees by the weight of the
vines. Animals, especially feral pigs, eat the fruit and distribute the seeds (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Escobar 1990).


P. mollissima

 is a threat to 

D. undulata

 and its habitat (J. Giffin, 

in litt.,

 1993. 


Senecio mikanioides

 (German ivy) is another vine that poses a serious threat to mesic and dry forests on Hawaii. It is becoming established
on Maui as well. 

Senecio mikanioides

 may be capable of establishing itself over vast areas of the island of Hawaii, including most of Hualalai. The vine
covers the forest canopy, which can result in structural damage and the reduction of available light. 

Senecio mikanioides

 also can form a significant ground cover in native forests of the southern Kona region of Hawaii where it may limit native
plant reproduction (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). 

Senecio mikanioides

 threatens 

D. undulata

 and its habitat (J. Giffin, 

in litt.,

 1993). 


Pennisetum clandestinum 

(Kikuyu grass), an aggressive, fire adapted, perennial grass introduced to Hawaii as a pasture grass, withstands
trampling and grazing and has naturalized on four Hawaiian Islands in dry to mesic forest. It produces thick mats which
choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings from becoming established. It has been declared a noxious weed
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (7 CFR 360) (O'Connor 1990, Smith 1985). Because Hawaiian plants were subjected
to fire during their evolution only in areas of volcanic activity and from occasional lightning strikes, they are
not adapted to recurring fire regimes and are unable to recover well following a fire. Fires may result from natural
causes, or they may be accidentally or purposely set by people. Vegetation on the slopes of Hualalai is particularly
vulnerable to fire due to the extensive invasion of 

P. clandestinum.

 Alien plants are often better adapted to fire than native plant species, and some fire-adapted grasses have become
widespread in Hawaii. Native shrubland can thus be converted to land dominated by alien grasses. The presence of such
species in Hawaiian ecosystems greatly increases the intensity, extent, and frequency of fire, especially during
drier months or drought. Fire-adapted alien species can reestablish in a burned area, resulting in a reduction in
the amount of native vegetation after each fire. Fire can destroy dormant seeds as well as mature plants and seedlings,
even in steep or inaccessible areas. The only known individual of 

D. undulata

 occurs in an area heavily grazed by cattle, and is offered some protection from fires since the cattle reduce the fuel
load of 

P. clandestinum.

 However, fire remains a potentially serious threat to the only known individual of 

D. undulata,

 its potential regeneration, and other suitable habitat (J. Giffin, 

in litt.,

 1993). 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by 

D. undulata

 in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list 

D. undulata

 as endangered. Only one individual of this species is known to exist, and it is threatened by habitat degradation by
feral ungulates and alien plants, fire, and lack of legal protection. Small population size makes this species particularly
vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events. Because this species is in danger
of extinction throughout all of its range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. 


Critical Habitat 





</TEXT>
</DOC>

<PARENT> FR940627-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit
to 

Delissea undulata. 

The extant population is on State land; State government agencies can be alerted to the presence of the plant without
the publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps. The publication of such descriptions and maps would potentially
increase the degree of threats from taking or vandalism because a live specimen of 

D. undulata 

 would be of interest to curiosity seekers or collectors of rare plants. Taking prohibitions are difficult to enforce,
and publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make 

D. undulata 

more vulnerable to taking and increase enforcement problems. All involved parties and landowners have been notified
of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through
the recovery process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known habitat of this species. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of this species. 


Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies,
private organizations, and individuals. Harold L. Lyon Arboretum of the University of Hawaii at Manoa is propagating
seeds collected from the one remaining individual as part of an 

ex situ 

conservation program. The Arboretum has over 300 seedlings growing as part of this conservation program, and has
sent approximately 20 individuals to the State's Hawaii forestry district for experimental outplanting in the Puu
Waawaa area (Charles H. Lamoureux, Harold L. Lyon Arboretum at University of Hawaii and J. Giffin, pers. comms.).
The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions
be carried out for all listed species. Since 

Delissea undulata 

is known to occur on State land, cooperation between Federal and State agencies is necessary to provide for its conservation.
The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants
are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7 of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that
is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No Federal involvement is known
or anticipated that would affect 

D. undulata, 

as the only known site is on State owned land. 

The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all
endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply to 

D. undulata. 

These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import
or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale
in interstate or foreign commerce, remove and reduce to possession an endangered plant species from areas under Federal
jurisdiction, maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction, or remove,
cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation
or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry
out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are
available for scientific purposes and to enhance the propagation and survival of the species. It is anticipated that
few trade permits would ever be sought or issued because the species is uncommon in cultivation and is very rare in the
wild. 

Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE 11th
Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503) 231&hyph;6131 . 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 

(1) biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

(2) the location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 

(3) additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and 

(4) current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species. 

The final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received
by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal. 

The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received
within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the
Pacific Islands Field Supervisor (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this
determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Proposed Revocation of Final Multi-substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to revoke the Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity
at 40 CFR 799.5050, promulgated under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), at 
58 FR 40262, July 27, 1993. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and the manufacturers
and processors of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. EPA is
proposing to revoke this rule as part of a settlement agreement reached with the manufacturers of these chemicals,
who have agreed to perform certain neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing on 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to
the final test rule, subject to execution of enforceable consent agreements (``ECA'') containing these studies.
Elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

, EPA is announcing an administrative stay of the final rule pending final action on this proposed revocation. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Written comments on the proposed revocation of the test rule must be received on or before July 27, 1994.




</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Submit written comments identified by the document control number, OPPTS&hyph;42134E, in triplicate to: TSCA Public

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to revoke the Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity
at 40 CFR 799.5050, promulgated under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), at 58 FR 40262, July
27, 1993. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and the manufacturers and processors
of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The manufacturers of
7 of the 10 chemicals subject to the final test rule have agreed, subject to certain conditions set forth in the settlement
agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct a set of neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing under enforceable consent agreements
(``ECA''). If ECA negotiations are successful, EPA believes that the previously issued final test rule would no longer
be needed. EPA believes that, under a negotiated ECA, neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing would be conducted
and results made publicly available more quickly, and EPA resources used more effectively, than if EPA continued
to litigate the merits of the final test rule.



The final test rule was published on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262), and requires manufacturers and processors of 10 substances
to conduct testing for neurotoxicity. It is anticipated that the following seven substances would be tested pursuant
to ECAs: acetone (CAS No. 67&hyph;64&hyph;1), technical grade 

n-

amyl acetate (CAS No. 628&hyph;63&hyph;7), 

n-

butyl acetate (CAS No. 123&hyph;86&hyph;4), ethyl acetate (CAS No. 141&hyph;78&hyph;6), isobutyl alcohol (CAS
No. 78&hyph;83&hyph;1), methyl isobutyl ketone (CAS No. 108&hyph;10&hyph;1), and tetrahydrofuran (CAS No. 109&hyph;99&hyph;9).
Testing is currently underway for 

n-

butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol. Pharmacokinetics testing would be conducted on butyl acetate to determine if
its test results for neurotoxicity can be used to assess the neurotoxicity of its metabolite, 1-butanol. EPA does
not anticipate entering into an ECA for 1-butanol (CAS No. 71&hyph;36&hyph;3), diethyl ether (CAS No. 60&hyph;29&hyph;7),
or 2-ethoxyethanol (CAS No. 110&hyph;80&hyph;5), three other substances for which testing is required under the
final test rule.

Elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

, EPA is soliciting interested parties for participation in or monitoring of ECA negotiations. The settlement agreement
signed by EPA and the parties to the lawsuit in April 1994 will be the starting point for the ECA negotiations. 




I. Background 



On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262) EPA issued a test rule under TSCA section 4 that required manufacturers and processors
of ten substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity (Ref. 1). The required testing was the same for all 10 substances
and included acute and subchronic functional observational battery and motor activity, and subchronic neuropathology
and schedule-controlled operant behavior. These 10 substances are listed below:

</TABLE>


The manufacturers of these substances petitioned for review of the final rule under TSCA section 19 in the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals (Ref. 2). Subsequent to the filing of this challenge to the rule, EPA, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (``CMA''), and authorized representatives of all parties challenging the rule, entered into settlement
negotiations to resolve the lawsuit.

As a result of these settlement discussions, CMA and the other parties to the lawsuit have agreed, subject to certain
conditions set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing
of seven chemical substances under negotiated ECAs, to be implemented by an order issued by EPA under TSCA section
4. Testing on two of the chemicals subject to the final rule, 

n-

butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol, is already underway. It is CMA's stated intent that such testing continue on schedule
during the pendency of this proceeding (Ref. 3).

In turn, EPA has agreed to propose to withdraw the final test rule. EPA is aware that the settlement agreement contemplates
a reduced set of testing on fewer chemicals than the testing regimen required by the final rule. Although EPA believes
that the rulemaking record contains substantial evidence to support the testing requirements in the final rule,
EPA has decided not to proceed with the litigation at this time. EPA believes that the uncertain outcome of the court's
decision is outweighed by the benefits of allowing testing to proceed immediately. EPA believes that the settlement
agreement is in the public interest as it will allow testing to proceed on an expedited basis, without the uncertainties
of protracted litigation. EPA notes that although CMA's lawsuit has been dismissed without prejudice by the 5th Circuit
Court of Appeals, in response to a joint motion for a stay, it can be reinstated by either party upon filing of a letter
with the court (Ref. 21). This Notice will allow all interested parties an opportunity to evaluate and comment on EPA's
proposed revocation of the final rule and decision to pursue an ECA as the mechanism for achieving testing.



II. Testing Program



The testing program required for all 10 substances by the final test rule includes the following tests conducted according
to the designated TSCA test guidelines:

l798.6500 

</TABLE>


In the above tests, the test substance is to be administered to rats by the inhalation route of exposure in either a single
exposure (acute) or repeated exposures over a 90&hyph;day period (subchronic). In both acute and subchronic studies,
the test substance is to be administered to several groups of experimental animals, one exposure concentration being
used per group. The animals are then to be observed under carefully standardized conditions with sufficient frequency
to ensure the detection of behavioral and/or neurologic abnormalities over the range of exposures and also to determine
the exposure level which results in no neurotoxic effect, i.e. no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). The non-invasive
functional observational battery is designed to detect gross functional deficits in young adult animals resulting
from exposure to the administered chemical. The non-invasive motor activity test is designed to examine changes
in the level and pattern of the animals' physical movement. These deficits and changes are also to be evaluated in the
context of changes in other organ systems. The test for neuropathology is designed to detect and characterize morphologic
changes in the tissue of the nervous system. The nervous system tissues are to be examined grossly and microscopically,
beginning with tissues from animals in the highest dose group and proceeding to lower dose groups until a no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) is determined. The non-invasive schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB) test
is intended to evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to a chemical on performance of a learned behavior by measuring
the rate and pattern of responding in relationship to the schedule of reinforcement.

In 1991 EPA updated its guidelines for neurotoxicity testing. The 1991 guidelines incorporate the functional observational
battery, motor activity, and neuropathology into a single guideline entitled ``Neurotoxicity Screening Battery.''
The SCOB test guideline remains a separate guideline. The 1991 guidelines evaluate the same endpoints as the older
guidelines and also provide for greater flexibility in the conduct of the testing.

In September 1993, CMA requested, on behalf of its member companies subject to the testing requirements of the final
rule, that EPA permit testing to be conducted according to the 1991 guidelines instead of the guidelines specified
in the final test rule (Ref. 4). EPA agreed to this modification (Ref. 5). CMA also requested modifications of the test
guidelines (Refs. 10, 14, 18 and 20) and modifications of the deadlines for submitting the test results (Refs. 10,
12, and 15). EPA granted most of these requests (Refs. 11, 13, 16, 17, and 19). The settlement agreement contemplates
the retention of all modifications to the final rule's testing requirements in the anticipated ECAs.

The settlement agreement contemplates the execution of ECAs to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing
of the following 7 chemical substances:

</TABLE>


Compared with the final rule, the above testing program represents a retention of the full set of tests for three chemicals
(

n-

butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate), a reduction in tests for four chemicals (acetone, 

n-

amyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran), and an elimination of testing for three chemicals (1-butanol,
diethyl ether, and 2-ethoxyethanol). It is anticipated, however, that the pharmacokinetics/metabolism test of


n-

butyl acetate may indicate that the separate testing of 1-butanol may not be necessary, and because of this 1-butanol
manufacturers have agreed to share in the cost of 

n-

butyl acetate testing. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of butyl acetate will be performed
in a study of its in vivo hydrolysis to 1-butanol. If the conversion of butyl acetate to 1-butanol is sufficiently rapid
and complete, EPA may determine that the neurotoxic effects of 1-butanol can be predicted from the results of butyl
acetate testing. If this is not the case, EPA may consider reproposing separate testing of 1-butanol.

The anticipated testing programs for acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) include only the SCOB; the neurotoxicity
screening battery for these two substances would be eliminated. EPA agreed to this change for the following reasons:
The body of available toxicity data on both chemicals is considerable, and the available studies, which might, at
some level, have shown the types of functional and morphologic effects which would be detected by the screening battery,
do not indicate such effects. Furthermore, the SCOB test, as a test of performance dependent on learning and memory,
evaluates a very different endpoint than those evaluated by the available toxicity studies. The SCOB may detect effects
not seen in existing studies and represents a greater data gap for these chemicals. In the case of acetone, there is
an additional reason for retaining the subchronic SCOB in the testing program. The acute SCOB test of acetone by Glowa
and Dews was positive (Ref. 6), and EPA believes this positive finding bears further investigation in a repeated-dose
test. For these reasons, EPA believes that this testing would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid
protracted litigation while still developing relevant data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these two
chemical substances.

MIBK is currently listed as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is considering initiating
a TSCA section 4 testing program for several CAA HAPs, including MIBK. If neurotoxicity testing of MIBK is proposed
under this HAPs testing effort, EPA believes that a delay of MIBK testing under the anticipated ECA would be warranted.
The delay, which would remain in effect pending the promulgation of the future HAPs test rule, would allow EPA and the
MIBK test sponsors to coordinate testing efforts under the consent order and the future test rule to achieve the most
efficient use of testing resources.

For both MIBK and acetone, EPA reserves the right to initiate future rulemaking or consent agreements if data from
the SCOB tests, other section 4 test programs, or any additional new information indicate the need for such a step.

The anticipated testing programs for 

n-

amyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran would include only the neurotoxicity screening battery; the SCOB tests would be
eliminated. Given the limited nature of neurotoxicity testing on these chemicals, EPA believes that, at this time,
the screening battery tests alone would represent an appropriate set of tests on these chemicals. Another factor
influencing EPA's decision is that 

n-

amyl acetate had the lowest production volume and lowest estimated exposure of all 10 substances in the final test
rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that this testing would represent a reasonable compromise which could avoid
protracted litigation while still developing relevant data necessary to determine the neurotoxicity of these two
chemical substances. EPA, however, reserves the right to initiate future rulemaking or consent agreements if new
information or the data developed from the screening battery tests of 

n-

amyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran indicate a need for such a step.

The decision to propose to revoke all testing requirements for diethyl ether and 2-ethoxyethanol (2-EE) is primarily
based on the estimated potential exposure to these substances. Diethyl ether has the second lowest production volume
of the 10 substances in the test rule, which should directly influence potential exposure. A second consideration
was that the available toxicity data on diethyl ether includes several human studies and more behavioral studies
than were available on the other 9 substances.

In the case of 2-ethoxyethanol, EPA anticipates a reduction in the potential exposure estimated by the proposed and
final rules. The environmental release of 2-ethoxyethanol has been confirmed to be on the decline by Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) data recently made available for the years 1990, 1991, and 1992 (Ref. 9). It is the only substance in
the final test rule for which current information indicates that there is no consumer exposure, i.e. the producers
of 2-EE who are parties to the settlement agreement have represented to EPA that there are no current consumer uses
of the chemical (Ref. 3). To monitor the possible reemergence of any consumer uses of 2-ethoxyethanol, in the near
future EPA intends to propose and promulgate a Significant New Use Rule (``SNUR'') under TSCA section 5(a)(2) to require
notification to EPA 90 days prior to the manufacture, import, or processing of 2-EE for use in a consumer product. The
parties to the agreement have agreed not to oppose such a rule (Ref. 3). Concerning occupational exposure to 2-ethoxyethanol,
EPA believes that if the recently proposed OSHA health standard for 2-ethoxyethanol (58 FR 15526, March 23, 1993)
becomes effective it should reduce the likelihood of occupational exposure (Ref. 7). OSHA's regulatory agenda schedules
this health standard to be finalized as soon as April 1995 (Ref. 8). Should the implementation of the OSHA health standard
be significantly delayed because of a legal challenge or if the consumer use of 2-ethoxyethanol reemerges, EPA may
feel compelled to reconsider proposing testing at that time. As stated earlier, EPA reserves the right to initiate
future rulemaking or consent agreements on these two 
substances if it appears warranted at that time. 



III. Proposed Revocation of Final Test Rule and Issues for Comment



Based upon the reasons stated above, EPA is proposing to revoke the final Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity
(40 CFR 799.5050). The decision to allow manufacturers of these substances to conduct neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing under ECAs should allow for the most timely development and public availability of data to assess the potential
neurotoxicity of these compounds. While EPA acknowledges that the testing that may be conducted under ECAs may not
be as extensive as that required by the final test rule, EPA believes that use of the ECA process will result in the fastest
development of data. Testing and data development will proceed without the potentially lengthy delay of testing
pending resolution of costly litigation on the merits of the final test rule.

V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis and review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this order, EPA has determined that this rule would not be ``significant.''




B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA is certifying that revocation of this test rule would
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses because only the 28 manufacturers who sign
the anticipated ECAs will be responsible for conducting and paying for the testing. None of these manufacturers are
small businesses. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



There are no information collection requirements associated with this proposed revocation covered under the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
