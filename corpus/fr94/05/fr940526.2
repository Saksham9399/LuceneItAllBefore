<DOCTITLE>Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Public Hearings for the Proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power
Project at Tracy Power Station, Nevada</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of draft environmental impact statement (draft statement) and notice of public hearings
on the draft.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (Department) announces the availability of the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project Draft Statement
(EIS&hyph;0215), prepared to assess the environmental effects of the design, construction, and operation of the
proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Project, a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired
power generating facility at Tracy Power Station, 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada. As one of the proposals selected under
Round IV of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would demonstrate an innovative
air-blown, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology. This technology, when compared to conventional
coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen,
and particles from a 104-Megawatt-electric coal-fired (800-ton-per-day) power plant. The proposed action is the
cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately $135 million (about 50 percent of the
total cost of approximately $270 million). The document assesses the long-term reliability, maintainability,
and environmental impacts of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle technology at a utility scale and setting.
The technologies to be demonstrated include a KRW Energy Systems Inc., pressurized, fluidized-bed gasifier with
in-bed limestone desulfurization and hot-gas clean-up processes, including an external regenerable desulfurization
system using zinc-based sorbents and fine particle filters.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties. Written comments or suggestions
regarding the adequacy, accuracy, and completeness of the Draft Statement will be considered in preparing the Final
Environmental Impact Statement (Final Statement) and should be received by July 23, 1994. Written comments received
after that date will be considered to the degree practicable.


The Department will also hold three public hearings at which agencies, organizations, and the general public are
invited to present oral comments or suggestions on the Draft Statement. Locations, dates, and times for the public
hearings are provided in the sections of this notice entitled ``PUBLIC HEARINGS.'' Written and oral comments will

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background and Need for the Proposed Action


The Department proposes to provide cost-shared funding support for the design, construction, and operation of a
104-Megawatt-electric (gross) coal-fired power plant at Tracy, Nevada, to demonstrate technology. The Pi&ntilde;on
Pine Power Project was proposed by Sierra Pacific Power Company and selected by the Department for negotiation of
a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance by the Clean Coal Technology program. The Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power
Project, when compared to conventional coal-fired power plant technologies, would demonstrate the cost effective
reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter from a 104-Megawatt-electric
coal-fired power plant using innovative Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle and hot gas cleanup technology.
Following a 42-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in August 2000, the facility would enter commercial
operation. The proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would be located at Sierra Pacific Power Company's existing
Tracy Power Station, a natural gas- and oil-fired 411-Megawatt-electric (estimate based on June 1994 projections)
power generation facility located on a rural 724-acre plot approximately 17 miles east of Reno, Nevada. The proposed
new facility would be built adjacent to these facilities.
On October 23, 1989, Public Law No. 101&hyph;121, ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1990,'' was signed into law. This Act, among other things, appropriated funds for the design, construction,
and operation of cost-shared, clean coal projects to demonstrate the feasibility of future commercial applications
of technologies capable of replacing, retrofitting or repowering existing facilities.

On January 17, 1991, the Department issued Program Opportunity Notice Number DE&hyph;PS01&hyph;91FE62271 for
Clean Coal Technology IV, soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared projects to demonstrate innovative, energy-efficient,
and economically competitive clean coal technologies. The Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project was one of the nine projects
selected from among the 33 proposals received.


Environmental Impact Statement Preparation


The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act, as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508)
and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). In accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Department determined that providing cost-shared funding for the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project
constitutes a major Federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore,
the Department has prepared a Draft Statement to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action and reasonable
alternatives to the proposed action on the human and natural environment.
A notice of intent (notice) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement and hold public scoping meetings in Nixon,
Fernley, and Reno, Nevada, was published by the Department in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1992 (57 FR 29067). The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of
the Environmental Impact Statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited public participation
in the National Environmental Policy Act process. Overall, 60 scoping comments were received that assisted in identifying
major issues for subsequent in-depth analysis in the Draft Statement. As a result of the scoping process, an Environmental
Impact Statement Implementation Plan was developed to define the scope and provide further guidance for preparing
the Environmental Impact Statement.
The Draft Statement considers the proposed action and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that
reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to atmospheric resources,
surface water, groundwater, biological resources (including threatened and endangered species), and socioeconomic
resources (including environmental justice) from construction and operation of the proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine
Power Project have been analyzed.
The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts
of the proposed construction and operation of the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project at the proposed site.


Floodplains Notification


Pursuant to Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with
Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR part 1022), the Department hereby provides notice
that a new primary electric switchyard proposed as one component of the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would be constructed
and operated in the 100-year floodplain as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (Panel Number 320033 0020B). Because of its proposed location in the 100-year floodplain, this switchyard
could potentially impede the flow of floodwaters. However, there is neither vegetation present in the affected area
nor wetlands or ecologically sensitive areas that would be involved. The electric switchyard, required to provide
an electrical connection between the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Plant and Sierra Pacific Power Company's existing
electrical system, would be approximately 75 square feet in size. The switchyard would be sited adjacent to and would
expand the existing switchyard for the Tracy Station Plant. The switchyard would directly impact the floodplain
because of site grading and filling and the permanent placement of switchyard equipment within the 100-year floodplain.
However, impacts to the 100-year floodplain such as flood storage, flood-flow conveyance, and wildlife habitat
are expected to be minimal due to the limited size and open structure of the switchyard. The potential environmental
impacts of site selection on the floodplain area are discussed in chapters 4 and 9 of the Draft Statement. Comments
regarding the effects of the proposed action on floodplains may be submitted to the Department in accordance with
the procedures described below.


Comment Procedures

Description of Project:

 The proposed pumped storage project would consist of: (1) An upper reservoir having a 580-acre surface area and a 26,000-acre-foot
storage capacity at water surface elevation 680 feet msl, created by a 225-foot-high, 9,800-foot-long dam, a 95-foot-high,
700-foot-long dike, and a 35-foot-high, 1300-foot-long dike; (2) a 300-foot-long, 110-foot-wide channel leading
to a submerged intake structure; (3) a shaft and tunnel trifurcating into three 20-foot-diameter steel-lined tunnels;
(4) an underground powerhouse containing three reversible pump-turbine units rated at 330&hyph;MW each operated
at a 450-foot head; (5) a 1,500-foot-long powerhouse access tunnel and an 18-foot- diameter vent and cable shaft;
(6) three concrete-lined tunnels leading to an outlet structure in Lake Clarke; (7) an above-ground switchyard;
(8) a three-mile-long, 250-kV transmission line; and (9) appurtenant facilities. Lake Clarke, an existing reservoir
formed by the Safe Harbor Dam (FERC Project No. 1025) would be utilized as a lower reservoir.

Core boring of the foundation overburden and underlying rock formation would be required. Applicant estimates that
the cost of the studies under the terms of the permit would be $235,000. Project energy would be purchased from and sold
to local utilities. A portion of the proposed project boundary for Project No. 11446 lies within the approved project
boundary for licensed project No. 1025. However, the proposed project facilities could be mutually compatible.

Docket No. CP82&hyph;537&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request
that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

CNG states that the proposed new tap will serve as a new delivery point to National, a local distribution company in
the vicinity, for transportation on an interruptible basis of up to 117,000 Dt of natural gas per day. It is stated that
National proposes to redeliver those volumes to Columbus Southern Power Company (Columbus Southern) for use in Columbus
Southern's electric generating plant located in Conesville, Coshocton County, Ohio (Conesville Plant).

It is stated that Columbus Southern is a subsidiary of American Electric Power Corporation (AEP), the second largest
investor-owned electric utility in the United States, and that AEP is required under the 1990 amendments to the Clean
Air Act to reduce its annual sulfur dioxide (S02) emissions. It is further stated that to reduce its S02 emissions,
the AEP has selected the option to convert the coal burning Conesville Plant, to burn natural gas, although Columbus
Southern will retain its ability to burn coal at the Conesville Plant.

CNG states that Columbus Southern has made arrangements to transport up to 117,000 Dt of natural gas per day on an interruptible
basis on CNG's interstate pipeline system. It is stated that CNG and Columbus Southern have signed an IT Rate Schedule
Service Agreement for up to 117,000 Dt per day, authorized under CNG's Part 284 Blanket Authorization.

CNG states further that in order for it to deliver Columbus Southern's gas to National for redelivery to the Conesville
Plant, a 16 inch tap, measuring and regulation station, and approximately 225 feet of 16 inch connecting line off of
CNG's TL&hyph;400 pipeline system in Coshocton County, Ohio must be constructed. CNG also stated that certain auxiliary
installations must be installed (gate valve assembly, a filter/separator, a line heater, various valves and yard
and station piping, and buildings) at the point of interconnection with TL&hyph;400.

CNG states that National has agreed to reimburse CNG for its cost, and that National will be the owner of the measuring
and regulation station and the 225 foot connecting line. However, CNG states that it will maintain and operate both
the measuring and regulation station and the connecting line.

<DOCTITLE>Williams Natural Gas Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>



May 20, 1994.




Take notice that on May 18, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (Williams), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed
in Docket No. CP94&hyph;554&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205, 157.208, and 257.216 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208 and 157.216) for authorization to replace approximately
9 miles of 4-inch lateral pipeline and appurtenant facilities with 6-inch pipeline located in Brown County, Kansas,
under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000, pursuant to sections 7(b) and (c) of
the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection.

Williams indicates that the existing 4-inch facilities were originally constructed in 1929 to serve the Cities of
Sabetha, Fairview, and Morrill, Kansas. Williams also states that, although the 4-inch facility is sufficient to
serve the three cities, there has been enough population growth in Sabetha over the years to cause an excessive pressure
drop during peak demands. It is alleged that replacing the 4-inch pipeline with 6-inch pipeline would alleviate the
pressure drop and assure adequate peak day deliveries for all three communities.


Williams indicates that it proposes to abandon the 4-inch pipeline in place with the exception of creek crossings
where the pipeline is exposed and where landowners request removal. Williams estimates the cost of the project at
approximately $1,011,690, which would be paid from available funds. Williams states that the total volume delivered
after installation of the new facilities is not expected to exceed the total volumes authorized prior to this request.

Williams states that it has included with its request a letter indicating that Kansas Power and Light, the local distributor
for the three towns, is aware of the planned pipeline replacement. Williams also indicates that it included with its
request letters acknowledging that eight of the ten residential customers served off the existing line are also aware
of the pipeline replacement. Williams also states that it anticipates that it would soon receive signed letters from
the other two domestic customers and that it would file those letters with the Commission.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

Closely Related to Banking Standard


Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' In determining whether a
proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 

inter alia

, the matters set forth in 

National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are 
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services;
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 

See

 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable
or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. 

Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y

, 49 FR 806 (1984). 
With respect to the proposal for Company to provide financial and transaction advice regarding the structuring and
arranging of swaps and similar transactions (including swap derivative products) relating to commodity prices
and commodity price indexes, Applicant maintains that the provision of such advice is functionally equivalent to
the provision of advice with respect to swaps and similar transactions based upon interest rates, currency exchange
rates, and economic and financial indices, an activity which the Board has determined to be closely related to banking.


See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(vi)(A)(2).


Proper Incident to Banking Standard


In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Company to offer its customers
a broader range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse
effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or
unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised
by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues
presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely
to meet the standards of the BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than June 10, 1994. Any request for a
hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices
of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

<DOCTITLE>Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to the </DOCTITLE>
Massachusetts Department of Public Health 


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds to
provide assistance to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), to conduct active rabies surveillance
in the vicinity of Cape Cod, to assess the efficacy of an oral vaccination program against wildlife rabies, to ascertain
the veterinary and human public health consequences that result, and to determine whether the program is cost beneficial.
Approximately $50,300 is available in FY 1994 to fund this award. It is expected that the award will begin on or about
July 8, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. A continuation award within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory
progress and availability of funds. 


The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to provide assistance to the MDPH to: 
(1) Conduct active rabies surveillance in the vicinity of Cape Cod; 
(2) Evaluate the efficacy of an oral wildlife rabies vaccine in Cape Cod; (3) Ascertain the epidemiologic determinants
and public health consequences of the study; and 
(4) Determine whether the cost of the program is beneficial towards rabies control in a region of high density of humans
and companion animals. 
The CDC will provide consultation and technical assistance in planning, conducting and evaluating the studies to
achieve program goals; provide serological and other appropriate laboratory assays to determine rabies status;
and collaborate with MDPH in applying the results of these studies to other appropriate venues. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Immunization and Infectious Diseases. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'') 


Authority 


This program is authorized under section(s) 301 [42 U.S.C. 241] 317(k)(1), and 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(1),
and 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Applicable program regulations are found in 42 CFR part
51b, Project Grants for Preventive Health Services and 42 CFR part 52, Grants for Research Projects. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicant 


Assistance will be provided only to MDPH. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application
kit have been sent to MDPH. The MDPH is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Issues surrounding the surveillance, diagnosis
and reporting of rabies throughout the State fall under the MDPH authority. The department promotes cooperative
efforts among the local town and county health departments of this State, shares knowledge on important public health
issues and is a central resource for the development and distribution of educational material for both professional
and technical development. 
During 1993, the MDPH supported a plan to promote the use of oral rabies vaccine among wildlife in the vicinity of Cape
Cod. The MDPH has developed appropriate educational materials, diagnostic criteria, methods for determining epidemiologic
factors which might be associated with rabies exposure and its consequent control throughout the State. In addition
to existing baseline data concerning rabies prevalence and already-developed educational vaccination campaign
materials, the MDPH has other characteristics which are essential to the study including: The authority to promote
active rabies surveillance and diagnosis in the region of study; ready access to major colleges and universities
and important cooperators such as wildlife rehabilitators in the vicinity of Cape Cod; for promotional and collaborative
activities access to community Cape Cod health centers which have the facilities necessary to gather and quantify
the needed statistics; and a system developed for veterinary and public health tracking of exposed animals and humans.
No other such oral wildlife rabies program having the geographical advantage offered by Cape Cod has been initiated
in the United States. Thus, the MDPH is uniquely qualified and the only eligible applicant for this study. 



Executive Order 12372 Review 


The application is subject to Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.)
12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications.
The applicant should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective
application and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. Information on the Massachusetts SPOC
is included in the application kit. If the SPOC has any State process recommendations on applications submitted to
CDC, they should forward them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement
and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Mailstop E&hyph;18,
room 314, Atlanta, Georgia 30305. (The receipt date for SPOC comments will be 60 days after the application deadline
date.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process recommendations it
receives after that date.

<DOCTITLE>State-Based Capacity Building Projects for the Prevention </DOCTITLE>
of Primary Disabilities and Secondary Conditions 



Introduction



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements for state-based capacity building projects to prevent primary disabilities and secondary
conditions. Financial assistance is being provided to develop or expand capacity of States to prevent disabilities
through public health leadership, coordination of services, public health surveillance, technical assistance,
and implementation and evaluation of community intervention programs. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the areas of Health Promotion, Health Protection, Preventive Services,
and Surveillance and Data Systems. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain
Additional Information.'') 


Authority 


This program is authorized by section 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and Section 317 (42 U.S.C. 247(b)) of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are the official public health departments of States or other State agencies or departments
that: (1) are not current recipients of an award under this program; or (2) are current recipients whose funding ends
in FY 1994. This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and
the Republic of Palau. 
Except in the case of currently funded States where programmatic relationships are established, State agencies
applying under this announcement that are other than the official State health department must provide written concurrence
from that agency. 
Only one application from each State may enter the review process and be considered for an award under this program.



Availability of Funds 


Approximately $4,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund 9 to 11 awards. It is expected that awards for States newly
funded under this announcement will range from $200,000 to $250,000. It is also expected that awards for currently
funded States that receive renewal funding under this announcement will range from $320,000 to $450,000. It is expected
that the awards will begin on or before September 30, 1994, and made for a 12-month budget period within a two year project
period. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will
be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 
The CDC currently funds 28 state-based capacity building projects. Ten of these States will complete their project
periods in September 1994. The CDC expects to make non-competing continuation awards to the remaining 18 States in
September 1994. Therefore, only a portion of the total FY 1994 national appropriations for State-based capacity
building projects will be available to support States competing under this announcement.

Use of Funds 



These awards may be used for personnel services, supplies, equipment, travel, subcontracts, and services directly
related to project activities. Project funds may not be used to supplant State or local funds available for disabilities
prevention, for construction costs, to lease or purchase facilities or space, or for patient care. Continuation
awards beyond the first budget year will be based on the availability of funds and on the satisfactory progress of recipients
in achieving project goals and objectives. 



Purpose 



The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to develop State capacity to reduce the incidence and severity of primary
disabilities and secondary conditions. These awards are being made to establish and maintain State leadership through
the development of basic State core capacity and conduct of special prevention projects in targeted disability groups.
Targeted disability groups are categories of primary disabilities and their associated secondary conditions.
These include selected developmental disabilities, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, and selected adult
chronic conditions. States may conduct special prevention projects in one or more of these targeted disability groups.
Core capacity activities should include appropriate collaborations with State and community agencies, advocacy
organizations, schools of public health, and other academia/universities including minority institutions. State-based
projects must provide technical assistance and increase the knowledge base necessary to design, implement, and
evaluate surveillance and interventions that prevent disabilities. State-based projects should become model
disability prevention programs capable of replication in other States. 



Program Requirements 



Applicants must indicate how their programs will meet this basic state-level core capacity for disabilities prevention.
State projects must include strong public health management, a representative advisory council and strategic planning
process, access to sound epidemiologic and public health surveillance capacity, and competence in guiding the conduct
of community intervention and health promotion activities. 

To that end, applicants must propose an office of disabilities prevention that includes a full-time manager/coordinator
position with the authority to carry out project requirements. The applicant should describe those project resources
and staff necessary to meet basic core requirements while also coordinating core-related functions and other activities
that reside outside of the office of disabilities prevention. 

Applicants should describe the organization structure and placement of the project and how this approach can maximize
the State's capacity to promote State policy and priority setting. The CDC prefers that State offices of disabilities
prevention have a 
program title that conveys their state-level coordination functions and responsibilities. However, applicants
may integrate this office into an established agency organization. 

Applicants should describe how they will meet both the requirements for basic core capacity and the implementation
of special prevention projects. Applications will be reviewed and ranked separately for basic state-level core
capacity and for special prevention projects. Special prevention projects will be funded only in States receiving
basic core capacity awards. 



Special Prevention Projects 



The following special prevention projects will be considered for funding. Other projects similar in scope considered
important by applicants should be included as basic state-level core capacity and presented in that section of the
application. The special prevention projects on this list must be completed prior to the start of the last quarter
of the project period. 

1. Assess the long-term morbidity and the consequences of specific secondary conditions associated with any of the
following primary disabling conditions: spina bifida, cerebral palsy, sickle cell disease, fetal alcohol syndrome,
traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, arthritis, osteoporosis, and urinary incontinence;

<DOCNO> FR940526-2-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940526-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Design, implement or evaluate new, or expand the use of an existing preventive intervention in one of the following
secondary conditions: (a) pressure sores in persons with mobility impairments; (b) progressive disability in persons
with arthritis; (c) behavioral problems in children with fetal alcohol syndrome;

3. Determine the preventive health care needs in consumer-managed activities such as centers for independent living,
assess the feasibility of conducting interventions, and/or implement health promotion programs in those settings;

4. Measure or evaluate the impact of one of the following: (a) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure on developmental disabilities;
(b) early intervention programs, e.g., home visiting programs, Head Start, educational child care, etc., in children
at environmental risk for mental retardation; or (c) early intervention programs for women at risk for having a child
with fetal alcohol syndrome;

5. Conduct a prevention program targeted to high risk groups in order to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome;

6. Develop model public health surveillance for mild and moderate traumatic brain injury;

7. Define the impact of firearm injury, especially related to traumatic brain and traumatic spinal cord injuries,
as to outcomes and secondary conditions;

8. Coordinate or conduct community interventions related to the prevention of bicycle injuries through increased
usage of bicycle helmets and prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased use of occupant protection;

9. Assess the prevalence of risk factors for osteoporosis and establish an intervention program addressing high-risk
groups;

10. Develop and conduct education programs for physicians and the public so that persons with urinary incontinence
will seek and receive proper treatment.

Detailed design and implementation guidance regarding these special prevention projects is available from CDC.
Please refer to the ``Where to Obtain Additional Information'' section.



Budget and Project Costs



This program has no statutory matching requirement; however, applicants should demonstrate their capacity to support
a portion of project costs, increase cost-sharing potential over time, and identify other funding sources for expanding
the project. Applicants must prepare separate budget requests for both the basic State core capacity and each special
prevention project (identifying both Federal and non-Federal sources).

While CDC has not set specific limits as to the proportion of the total application budget request that should be directed
to basic State core capacity, it anticipates that funds to support such core capacity will range from $200,000 to $330,000.

It is also anticipated that each special prevention project will have a budget ranging from $40,000 to $60,000. Applicants
may propose special prevention projects at a budget level below or above this range. The overall quality of proposed
special prevention projects, taking into account total funds available, will be the major factor as to those projects
that will be funded. The CDC expects that no State will receive awards for more than three special prevention projects.

In conducting activities to achieve the purposes of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities) and CDC shall be responsible for the activities listed under B. (CDC Activities).



A. Recipient Activities



1. Develop an identified, highly visible state-based program for the prevention of disabilities and secondary conditions

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s), 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s), 348(b)(5))), notice is
given that a food additive petition (FAP 4A4419) has been filed by Kuraray International Corp., c/o 1001 G St. NW.,
Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposes that the food additive regulations in &sect;172.864 

Synthetic fatty alcohols

 (21 CFR 172.864) be amended to provide for the safe use of 

n

-octanol produced by a new manufacturing process, the hydrodimerization of 1,3-butadiene.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs for Fiscal Year 1994</DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''

year (FY) 1994 Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs funded under the authority of section 831(a), title
VIII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992,
title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October
13, 1992. 


Purpose 


Section 831(a) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to cover the costs of projects
to develop and operate programs for the education of nurse anesthetists. 


Statutory Funding Preference 


In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_
(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 
(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 


Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 


A notice which announced this grant cycle was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1994 at 59 FR 769, and proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the
rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the 30 day
comment period. Therefore, the percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as
proposed. The final minimum percentages are shown below. 
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990&hyph;91, 1991&hyph;92 or 1992&hyph;93
who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing
care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted.
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.

 Notice of GNMA REMIC Program Implementation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Government National Mortgage Association (``Ginnie Mae'') is implementing a new program under which Ginnie
Mae will guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed securities issued by trusts, each of which will elect to be treated
as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (``REMIC''). The program is intended to: (1) Benefit borrowers using
federally insured or guaranteed mortgages by increasing investment demand for the single class Ginnie Mae guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') that are backed by these mortgages, and which will be the assets of the REMIC
trusts, thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and (2) raise revenues through the receipt of guarantee
fees by Ginnie Mae. The Ginnie Mae REMIC program will be implemented in two stages: An initial stage, which will have
a limited number of participants and REMIC transactions, and a full participation stage.



The statute authorizing the Ginnie Mae REMIC program provides for implementation of the program by publication of
a notice in the 

Federal Register

. This Notice is being published prior to implementation of the initial stage, and provides opportunity to submit
comments. A supplemental notice will be published prior to implementation of the full participation stage, and will
provide another opportunity to submit comments, after which a final rule will be issued.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background


Ginnie Mae was created in 1968 as a wholly-owned Government corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. As set out in Title III of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1716 

et seq.

), Ginnie Mae was established to assist in the movement of funds from investors into the housing market. Ginnie Mae's
most effective tool in accomplishing this mission has been the Ginnie Mae guaranteed MBS. Through its MBS program,
Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions
and backed by pools of mortgage loans which are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department
of Veterans Affairs, and the Farmers Home Administration (``Government mortgages''). Ginnie Mae MBS are sought
by investors because the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind the Ginnie Mae guarantee. 
Eligible mortgages are put into groups or pools by a ``Ginnie Mae issuer,'' an entity that has been approved by Ginnie
Mae to pool Government mortgages and sell, or ``issue,'' Ginnie Mae guaranteed securities. By selling the security
to investors, the issuer is able to recapture the outstanding balance of the mortgages, which can then be used to fund
more mortgages. Lenders that are not Ginnie Mae issuers also gain liquidity through the MBS program because they can
sell Government mortgages to Ginnie Mae approved issuers for inclusion in pools. 
Holders of Ginnie Mae MBS receive monthly payments made up of principal, including prepayments, and interest on the
underlying mortgage loans. The amount of interest ``passed through'' to security holders is reduced by payment of
a fee to cover servicing of the mortgages (in the case of single family mortgages, at an annual rate of 44 basis points
on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage) and a fee to Ginnie Mae for its guarantee (for single family mortgages,
at an annual rate of 6 basis points). 
Under the ``modified pass-through'' approach used by Ginnie Mae, the issuer of the MBS is initially responsible for
advancing scheduled but delinquent principal and interest payments to security holders. That is, if mortgagors
fail to make timely payments of principal and interest, the issuer of the Ginnie Mae MBS promises to advance the necessary
funds so that scheduled payments can be made to the security holders. If the issuer fails to advance or pass through
payments, Ginnie Mae makes timely payment under its guarantee. 
The Federal National Mortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``Freddie
Mac'') have issued REMIC securities which are backed by Ginnie Mae MBS (in addition to a substantial volume of REMIC
securities backed by their own MBS). However, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises,
they are not federal government entities, and neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac is authorized to issue a REMIC security
which is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some depository institutions, pension funds and
other types of investors are required or desire to invest a portion of their funds in instruments directly backed by
the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Because Ginnie Mae can provide such a full faith and credit guarantee,
Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC securities are likely to be attractive to such investors, even though other REMIC instruments
backed by Ginnie Mae MBS are presently available. 
Section 3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (``OBRA''), 107 Stat. 339, contains guidance for implementation
of a program under which Ginnie Mae will guarantee such multiclass securities and the use of contracts to ensure the
efficient commencement and continued operation of a multiclass securities program. Under this authority, Ginnie
Mae has employed a financial advisor (``Financial Advisor'') and a legal advisor (``Legal Advisor'') to assist in
the initiation of the program.

II. The Ginnie Mae Guaranteed REMIC Program


A. General Description 


The MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae have a single class of ownership interests. In a single class MBS, each security sold
bears the same coupon rate of interest, has the same scheduled maturity, and has the same expected average life. Each
holder of a single class MBS is the owner of an undivided beneficial interest in the mortgage pool and is entitled each
month to receive: (1) Interest at a fixed rate, and (2) a 

pro rata

 share of all principal payments, including prepayments, made on the underlying pool of mortgages. For this reason,
MBS are not attractive to certain investors who want to invest in securities tailored to their individual investment
goals. Multiclass securities, the most common of which today are REMICs, were developed to meet this need. 
The REMIC structure permits allocation of the underlying cash flow from MBS to multiple classes of securities with
differing maturities and interest rates. The cash flow allocation specified at creation of the transaction establishes
the rights of the various classes of security holders to receive interest and principal payments. These allocations
may result in REMIC investors receiving repayment of principal and/or interest at different times. For example,
the different maturity classes, which are commonly referred to as ``tranches,'' might have expected maturities
of 2, 5, 7, 10 and 20 years with each of these classes paying a different rate of interest. Because the amount and timing
of the pass-through of funds to the investor is tailored to the investor's specific financial goals, the value of the
REMIC tranches is increased. The timing and amount of payments on tranches may vary depending on the prepayments of
the mortgages backing the single class MBS. However, total payments to all REMIC investors correspond to the total
full and timely payments on the single class MBS in the REMIC pool or trust. REMIC trusts are not treated as separate
taxable entities and, thus, there is no double taxation, pursuant to sections 860A through 860G of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the ``Code''). 
The Ginnie Mae REMICs will be backed by Ginnie Mae guaranteed MBS. Government mortgages will continue to be pooled,
and a traditional single class Ginnie Mae MBS will be issued in the customary fashion by Ginnie Mae issuers. These Ginnie
Mae MBS will be pooled in a second stage transaction, and multiclass Ginnie Mae pass-through securities will be issued.
The second stage transaction will elect tax treatment under the REMIC provisions of the Code. Ginnie Mae will guarantee
the full and timely payment of principal and interest on the REMIC securities. 
The Ginnie Mae REMICs will be issued through single purpose trusts created by knowledgeable and financially sound
firms (the ``sponsors'') that assemble the Ginnie Mae MBS, take the initiative in forming the trust, in developing
the structure for the REMIC securities (i.e., how many tranches with what characteristics), in preparing the description
and disclosure for the offering documents and in marketing the REMIC securities. 
In a REMIC transaction, there must be an identifiable pool or trust (Ginnie Mae expects a separate trust to be used for
each REMIC) and a trustee of proven reliability and competence to ensure that amounts owed to the trust are collected
by it, that the correct amounts are paid out timely by the trust to the holders of the REMIC securities, and that accurate
records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, the IRS, and Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae
will require that the REMIC trustee make available to Ginnie Mae the full financial details of the REMIC trust and that
the trustee follow industry performance standards. Rules and procedures governing the trust and its operation,
including detailed rules as to distributions of principal and interest to each class, must be spelled out in trust
documents approved or prescribed by Ginnie Mae. Experienced trust counsel will be responsible for modifying the
standard documentation for each trust and issuing the customary trust counsel opinions for reliance by Ginnie Mae,
among others. Verification that the obligations of the REMIC securities pursuant to the terms of the trust documents
can be met under all possible patterns of cash flows (``structural integrity'') must be represented without qualification
to Ginnie Mae by the sponsor and Ginnie Mae's Financial Advisor. In addition, a qualified accounting firm must provide
Ginnie Mae with a customary comfort letter. 
Sponsors must indemnify Ginnie Mae, with interest, for any payments that Ginnie Mae makes pursuant to its REMIC securities
guaranty because of a defect or lack of structural integrity of the REMIC transaction. Trustees must indemnify Ginnie
Mae for losses caused by any breach of obligations to or for the benefit of Ginnie Mae as set forth in trust documents.



B. Eligible MBS


Ginnie Mae expects that Ginnie Mae REMIC trusts will be required to pass through cash electronically to REMIC security
holders on the same day that the trusts receive immediately available funds on the Ginnie Mae MBS they hold. To facilitate
this, only MBS with the following characteristics will be permitted: (1) Ginnie Mae I MBS issued on or after February
1, 1993; (2) backed by single family mortgages; (3) in book entry form; and (4) registered in the name of the designated
depository.

C. Depository



At the present time, as a program control element, Ginnie Mae has designated that REMIC securities be registered at
the same depository as is currently the depository for Ginnie Mae MBS, Participants Trust Company (``PTC'').



D. Ginnie Mae Guaranty Fees



The Ginnie Mae guaranty fee is initially set at 20 basis points. This fee may be adjusted upward or downward at such times
and in such manner as Ginnie Mae determines appropriate.



E. Payment Date



REMIC securities holders will be paid on the 16th day of each month, or if the 16th is not a business day, on the first business
day following the 16th.



F. Other Program Fees



During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will have no liability for payment of any fees or expenses (other than those of
Ginnie Mae's Legal Advisor; see below) in connection with Ginnie Mae REMIC transactions, such as those of trustees,
trust counsel and accounting firms, including payment of Ginnie Mae's Financial Advisor. These fees and costs will
be paid out of the sales proceeds, and closing will be contingent upon their payment, except for payments to the trustees,
which will be paid by the trust from the trust cash flow.



III. Authority



Ginnie Mae's authority to guarantee REMIC instruments is contained in section section 306(g)(1) of the National
Housing Act (``NHA'') (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(1)), which authorizes Ginnie Mae to guarantee ``securities *&blank;*&blank;*
based on or backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages *&blank;*&blank;* .'' The REMIC securities will be based
on or backed by mortgages since Ginnie Mae MBS will serve as the collateral. The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac REMIC programs
are authorized by substantially similar statutory provisions. Further, Ginnie Mae's authority to operate a REMIC
program has recently been confirmed in section 3004 of the OBRA which amended section 306(g)(3) of the NHA (12 U.S.C.
1721(g)(3)) to provide Ginnie Mae with greater flexibility for the REMIC program regarding fee structure, contracting,
industry consultation and program implementation. The General Counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development
will issue a legal opinion that, pursuant to section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, Ginnie Mae has the statutory
authority to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on the REMIC securities in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the trust agreement, and that this guaranty is backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States.

In appropriations legislation, Congress annually sets Ginnie Mae's commitment authority to guarantee MBS. The
amount of MBS commitment authority authorized by Congress is set forth in section 306(g)(2) of the NHA (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(2)).
Since the REMIC securities will be backed by Ginnie Mae MBS, Ginnie Mae has already guaranteed the collateral for the
REMIC. Accordingly, it has been determined that the section 306(g)(2) limitations are not affected by, and do not
limit the issuance of, Ginnie Mae's guarantees of REMIC securities. This determination was supported by the House
of Representatives Committee on Appropriations. (See H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;150, 103D Cong., 1st Sess. at 34.)



IV. Initial Stage



Ginnie Mae is beginning its REMIC program with an ``initial stage,'' which is expected to have a duration of several
months, until standard policies, procedures and documents are developed and the full participation stage can be
commenced. During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will guarantee REMICs that are issued by a small number of participants,
consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel and accounting firms, selected by Ginnie Mae through
the use of Competitive Application Proposals (``CAPs''). In addition, Ginnie Mae has obtained the services of a Legal
Advisor and a Financial Advisor through competitive proposals to provide Ginnie Mae with assistance in implementing
the REMIC program. In the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will develop documents that will serve as the basis for all subsequent
REMICs, as well as guidelines and procedures.

During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will establish an order of rotation for each of the five participant functions.
Teams, consisting of a sponsor, co-sponsor, trustee, trust counsel and accounting firm, will be created based on
the rotation. Ginnie Mae anticipates that several team rotations will be required before the full participation
stage can commence.



V. Full Participation Stage Notice



Following the initial stage, the Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC program will be opened to all approved sponsors. Ginnie
Mae will issue a REMIC Guide, which will contain Ginnie Mae's requirements for participation in the Ginnie Mae REMIC
program as well as Ginnie Mae's standard documents. Ginnie Mae will publish another notice, which will contain specific
procedures for initiating Ginnie Mae guaranteed REMIC transactions in the full participation stage.



VI. Terms and Conditions for Participants



As a condition of participation in the program, each participant must agree to the conditions set out below.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940526-2-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940526-2-00035 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. Participant Certification



Participants must certify, in a statement made under penalty of perjury, regarding all professionals working on
a transaction, whether for the participant or for a contractor of a participant, that neither the corporate or partnership
entity nor any officer, partner, or professional presently employed and who will work on the subject matter of this
Notice has been convicted of, or found liable in a civil action for, fraud, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction
of records, making false statements or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity that seriously and
directly affects the present responsibility of the officer, partner or professional and is not currently suspended
or debarred by any government agency.



B. Maintaining Eligibility.



Participants will provide Ginnie Mae annually with such documentation as Ginnie Mae shall require demonstrating
that the participant continues to meet the eligibility requirements for participation in the Ginnie Mae REMIC program.



C. Disclosures



A participant shall provide disclosures of the following:

(1) Any indictments, convictions, civil suits or judgments described in Section V, within 30 days of their occurrence;

(2) Material adverse changes in status including voluntary and non-voluntary terminations, defaults, fines, and
agency findings of material non-compliance or non-conformance with agency rules and policies with state and federal
agencies and government sponsored enterprises within 5 business days of their occurrence; and

(3) A change in control within 30 days of its occurrence. In a merger, consolidation, acquisition, division, issuance
of securities, sale, or other business combination where the control of the original participant has changed materially,
the surviving party shall demonstrate to Ginnie Mae's satisfaction its qualification to act as a participant and
its ability and agreement to assume all previously incurred obligations and liability to Ginnie Mae of the original
approved participant.



D. Suspension From the Ginnie Mae REMIC Program



The participant's eligibility may be suspended upon written notice from Ginnie Mae, which shall include the reasons
for the suspension. Upon such notice, the participant shall have the opportunity to present a written submission
to the President of Ginnie Mae in support of its reinstatement, which submission shall exhaust the participant's
administrative remedies.



VII. Default



If Ginnie Mae is required to perform under its guarantee of any REMIC security, Ginnie Mae intends to pursue all available
avenues of recovery.



VIII. Minority and Women-Owned Business Participation



Ginnie Mae requests comments on how Ginnie Mae can best meet its goals for participation by minorities and women. For
the initial stage, the CAP for sponsors provides for the selection of both sponsors and minority and women-owned businesses
(``MWOB'') co-sponsors. Ginnie Mae will require that sponsors include a MWOB co-sponsor selected by Ginnie Mae in
each initial stage Ginnie Mae REMIC transaction. It is Ginnie Mae's understanding that a similar mandatory co-sponsor
approach for MWOBs is used by the Resolution Trust Corporation (``RTC'') and Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'')
for their REMIC programs.

However, Ginnie Mae anticipates that the full participation stage of its REMIC program may involve 100 or more REMIC
transactions per year, which is much larger than the RTC and VA programs. The RTC and VA REMIC programs also are distinguishable
in that RTC and VA own the collateral and actively participate in the issuance of REMIC securities. In contrast, during
the full participation stage of the Ginnie Mae program, collateral will be assembled and REMIC transactions will
be presented to Ginnie Mae for guaranty approval with the participants and the proposed terms of the transactions
already in place.



A. Types of MWOB Participation



GNMA requests comments on the type of MWOB participation in the GNMA REMIC program. For example, should there be an
aggregate MWOB goal for each transaction (e.g., accounting firm, trust counsel, and others), or should the Ginnie
Mae REMIC program include a co-sponsor component only, as in the initial stage.

If a commentor believes that Ginnie Mae should have an MWOB co-sponsor component, Ginnie Mae requests comments on
how a co-sponsor component could be coordinated in the full participation stage and whether there are other programs
comparable to the Ginnie Mae REMIC program that use a co-sponsor component (including information on the size of such
other programs and contact persons and telephone numbers).

Also, Ginnie Mae solicits detailed comments on what the role of any co-sponsor should be and how Ginnie Mae should oversee
arrangements between sponsors and co-sponsors. Comments should address: (1) Whether Ginnie Mae should specify
a minimum percentage for co-sponsor participation and, if so, what the percentage should be and to what it should apply;
(2) whether co-sponsors should be required to take harder-to-sell REMIC tranches as well as easier-to-sell tranches;
(3) whether co-sponsors should be required to share in the capital risk of accumulating MBS; (4) whether Ginnie Mae
should specify the discount at which co-sponsors acquire their REMIC securities and, if so, what that discount should
be; (5) whether Ginnie Mae should specify the consequences of a co-sponsor's failure to fulfill its obligations to
the lead sponsor and, if so, what those consequences should be; and (6) the process that Ginnie Mae should employ before
consequences are imposed upon a co-sponsor.

In the comments on these issues, Ginnie Mae requests that commentors include a discussion of the feasibility of their
proposals, and the advantages and disadvantages of each proposal.



B. Types of Incentives



Ginnie Mae requests comments on: (1) What might be appropriate incentives to encourage participants to include MWOB
participation in the Ginnie Mae REMIC transactions, either in the aggregate or as co-sponsors; (2) whether a mandatory
or an encouragement/goal oriented system should be used; (3) the current state of the law, including the recent cases

During the initial stage, Ginnie Mae will consider the comments received in response to this Notice, and will make
a determination for the full participation stage. 



IX. Publication of Final Rule 



Pursuant to section 3004 of the OBRA, final regulations for the Ginnie Mae REMIC program must be published within twelve
months of the publication of this notice. This notice will be supplemented by further publication in the 

Federal Register

 prior to publication of the final regulations in order to provide additional information for procedures applicable
to the full participation stage. 



X. Other Matters 



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 



Since this document ultimately will serve as the foundation for development of a final rule and is the basis for a new
program, it was sent to the OMB for review under Executive Order 12866 and was approved for publication. 



Environmental Review 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276,
451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this notice does not have ``federalism implications'' because it does not have substantial direct effects on
the States (including their political subdivisions), or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among
the various levels of government. This notice only affects participants and investors in Ginnie Mae guaranteed single
and multiclass securities industry. States and their political subdivisions would not be affected. 



Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
notice does not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being because
it only affects participants and investors in Ginnie Mae guaranteed single and multiclass securities. 



Lobbying Activities 



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 

Section 13 was implemented by a final rule codified as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the
regulation. 

Any questions about that rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815; TDD: (202)
708&hyph;1112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from
the local HUD office.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that Clark County and the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, and Boulder
City, Nevada (Applicants) have applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an amendment to their existing
permit (PRT 756260) authorizing incidental take of desert tortoises (

Gopherus agassizii

) pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The proposed amendment
would extend the term of the existing permit one year, to July 31, 1995 and allow disturbance of 8,000 additional acres
within the existing permit area. The number of desert tortoises taken would not increase above what is currently authorized
under the existing permit, which is up to 3,710 tortoises. The permit application is accompanied by amendments to
the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and Implementation Agreement (IA).




The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed amendment to the
permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations
(40 CFR 1506.6).



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Written comments on the permit application and EA should be received on or before June 27, 1994.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESS: 

Comments regarding the application or adequacy of the EA should be addressed to Mr. David Harlow, Field Supervisor,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Reno Field Office, 4600 Kietzke Lane, Building C, room 125, Reno, Nevada 89502. Please
refer to permit no. PRT&hyph;756260 when submitting comment.



</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Ms. Sheryl Barrett, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Reno Field Office, 4600 Kietzke Lane, Building C, room 125, Reno,
Nevada 89502 (702&hyph;784&hyph;5227). Individuals wishing copies of the application or EA for review should immediately
contact the above individual. Documents will be available for public inspection, by appointment, and during normal
business hours at the Reno Field Office (address given above). Documents will also be available for review at the reference
desks of all public libraries in Clark County, Nevada.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



Under section 9 of the Act, and implementing regulations, ``taking'' of desert tortoises a threatened species, is
prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take threatened wildlife species
if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits
for threatened species are in 50 CFR 17.32.

The Applicants propose to amend their existing permit, and have proposed amendments to the HCP and IA for their permit,
which authorizes incidental take of desert tortoises in the Las Vegas Valley and Boulder City. The existing permit
was issued July 24, 1991, and authorizes the incidental take of up to 3,710 desert tortoises on 22,352 acres of desert
tortoise habitat, within the specified permit area. As of December 1993, 701 desert tortoises have been taken pursuant
to the existing permit and approximately 15,383 acres of tortoise habitat have been developed. By the time the existing
permit expires, disturbance of all or nearly all of the 22,352 acres of habitat authorized by the existing permit is
expected to occur, but the number of tortoises expected to be taken is well below 3,710. To minimize and monitor the
incidental take authorized under the existing permit, the Applicants have implemented procedures to survey and
remove tortoises located on development properties; placed these tortoises in research, education, and adoption
programs; implemented audit procedures; and conducted a public information program. To mitigate for impacts to
the desert tortoise authorized by the existing permit, the Applicants have implemented a tortoise habitat conservation
program in Clark County. As of December 1993, the Applicants have preserved approximately 330,000 acres of habitat
for the long-term management of desert tortoises in the Piute-Eldorado Desert Wildlife Management Area. The Applicants
will conserve an additional 70,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat prior to the expiration date of the existing permit.
The conserved habitat is located primarily on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the National
Park Service. Management actions, including increased law enforcement, above and beyond what is legally required
of the Federal land managers, are funded by the Applicants through a $550-per-acre mitigation fee on development
projects covered by the existing permit.

To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the additional 8,000 acres of desert tortoise habitat proposed to be developed
under the permit amendment, the applicants propose to amend the existing HCP by: (1) Assessing a $550-per-acre mitigation
fee on the additional 8,000 acres of habitat disturbance; (2) adding an additional $100,000 to the research monies
established under the existing permit; (3) adding $100,000 to the public education fund established under the existing
permit; (4) increasing the current $3,125,000 trust fund for income to manage and monitor conserved habitat by $1,000,000;
and (5) adding approximately 140,000 acres of conserved habitat to the tortoise management area established under
the existing permit.

The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including amendment of the permit as proposed,
extension of the permit with no additional habitat disturbance, and no action.

ACTION:

 Notice of decision.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 25, 1994,, the Commission served a decision to update its estimate of the railroad industry's cost of capital
for 1993. The composite cost of capital rate for 1993 is found to be 11.4%, based on a current cost of debt of 6.9%, a cost
of preferred equity capital of 3.9%, a cost of common equity capital of 13.2%, and a 25.7% debt, 2.0% preferred equity,
and 72.3% common equity capital structure mix. The cost of capital finding made in this proceeding will be used in a
variety of Commission proceedings.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<RINDOCK>[Docket Nos. 50&hyph;438 and 50&hyph;439]</RINDOCK>



Bellefonte Nuclear Plant; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of extensions of the latest construction
completion dates specified in Construction Permit Nos. CPPR&hyph;122 and CPPR&hyph;123 issued to Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA, applicant) for the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant (BLN), Units 1 and 2, respectively. The facility is located
at the applicant's site on the west shore of Guntersville Reservoir, about 6 miles east-northeast of Scottsboro,
Alabama.



Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action




The proposed action would extend the latest construction completion date of Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;122
from July 1, 1994 to October 1, 2001 and the latest construction completion date of Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;123
from July 1, 1996 to October 1, 2004. The proposed action is in response to the applicant's request dated April 19, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed action is needed because the construction of the facility is not yet fully completed. The applicant requested
the extensions because construction activities had been deferred in 1988 due, in part, to a lower than expected load
forecast. On March 23, 1993, TVA notified NRC that it planned to resume completion activities 120 days from the date
of the letter. As a result of the delay from the inactivity during the construction deferral, TVA is unable to complete
the construction of the two units before the expiration dates of the construction permits, therefore extensions
are now necessary. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, TVA is currently engaged
in an Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process to consider the least cost options for providing an adequate supply
of electricity to TVA's customers. As part of this planning process, TVA will evaluate the completion of the BLN units
along with other generating options. The IRP process is presently scheduled for completion in November 1995. Additional
delays associated with the above efforts to ensure that BLN meets regulatory requirements and licensing commitments
make it necessary for TVA to request extensions of the expiration dates for Construction Permit Nos. CPPR&hyph;122
and CPPR&hyph;123.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The environmental impacts associated with the construction of the facility have been previously discussed and evaluated
in the staff's Final Environmental Statement (FES) issued in June 1974 for the construction permit stage which covered
construction of both units.

The proposed extensions will not allow any work to be performed that is not already allowed by the existing construction
permit. The only change is that the environmental impacts discussed and evaluated in the FES will be gradual and extend
to longer periods of time than the construction periods considered in the FES. The probability of accidents has not
been increased and post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined, nor do the
proposed extensions otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that
there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed extensions.

Based on the foregoing, the NRC staff has concluded that the proposed action would have no significant environmental
impact. Since this action would only extend the period of construction activities described in the FES, it does not
involve any different impacts or a significant change to those impacts described and analyzed in the original environmental
impact statement. Consequently, an environmental impact statement addressing the proposed action is not required.



Alternatives Considered



A possible alternative to the proposed action would be to deny the request. Under this alternative, the applicant
would not be able to complete construction of the facility. This would result in a denial of the benefit of power production.
This option would not eliminate the environmental impacts of construction already incurred.

If construction were halted and not completed, site redress activities would restore some small areas to their natural
states. This would be a slight environmental benefit, but much outweighed by the economic losses from denial of use
of a facility that is nearly completed. (Unit 1 is about 85% complete, and Unit 2 is about 45% complete). Therefore,
this alternative is rejected.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the FES for Bellefonte.



Agencies and Persons Contacted



The NRC staff reviewed the applicant's request and applicable documents referenced therein that support the extensions.
The NRC did not consult other agencies or persons.




Finding Of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this action. Based upon the environmental
assessment, the staff concludes that this action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

For details with respect to this action, see the request for extensions dated April 19, 1994, which is available for
public inspection at the Commission Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC and at the Local Public
Document Room, Scottsboro Public Library, 1002 South Broad Street, Scottsboro, Alabama 37402.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval extensions and/or proposed revisions for
the following rules and forms:

Form N&hyph;4 is the registration form used by separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts. The form is
used to register the separate accounts as unit investment trusts under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act)
and to register the securities issued by the separate accounts under the Securities Act of 1933. There are approximately
288 registrants currently filing Form N&hyph;4. It is estimated that it would take 139.3 hours per respondent with
a total annual burden of 40,118 hours.

Form N&hyph;17f&hyph;1 is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 17f&hyph;1
under the 1940 Act by management investment companies maintaining securities or other investments with companies
that are members of a national securities exchange. There are approximately 23 registrants currently filing accountant
examination certificates. The time necessary for investment companies to comply with the form's requirements is
less than three minutes.

Form N&hyph;17f&hyph;2 is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 17f&hyph;2
under the 1940 Act by management investment companies maintaining custody of securities or other investments. There
are approximately 130 registrants currently filing accountant examination certificates. The time necessary for
investment companies to comply with the form's requirements is less than three minutes.

Form ADV&hyph;E is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 206(4)&hyph;2
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) by investment advisers retaining custody of client securities
or funds. There are approximately 752 registrants currently filed accountant examination certificates. The time
necessary for investment advisers to comply with the form's requirements is less than three minutes.

Rule 6a&hyph;1 and Form 1 prescribes the form for registration as a national securities exchange. New filings on Form
1 are very rare, with an estimated burden of 45 hours per response.

Rule 22d&hyph;1 requires that any scheduled variation be applied uniformly to all offerees. Absent adequate public
notice, shareholders would not necessarily learn about new scheduled variations in sales load. The rule imposes
a burden of 15 minutes annually, per respondent.

Rule 12b&hyph;1 requires registered open-end investment companies that intend to distribute their own securities
and pay the expenses of distribution to adopt a distribution plan, provide directors with quarterly reports of expenditures
pursuant to that plan and keep certain records. The rule imposes an annual burden of 40 hours per registrant to maintain
a distribution plan.

Form S&hyph;1 is used by issuers that are not eligible to use any of the specialized forms to register securities pursuant
to the federal securities laws. It is estimated that approximately 1,239 respondents would file Form S&hyph;1 annually
at 1,275 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 1,579,725 hours.

Form S&hyph;4 is used by issuers to register securities issued in business combination transactions pursuant to
the federal securities laws. It is estimated that approximately 505 respondents would file Form S&hyph;4 annually
at 1,235 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 623,675 hours.

Form 10 registers securities pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for classes
of issuers for which no other form is prescribed. It is estimated that approximately 110 respondents would file Form
10 annually at 99 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 10,890 hours.

Form 10&hyph;K elicits information concerning the financial condition and business operations for each fiscal
year for issuers of publicly-traded securities pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. It is estimated that approximately 6,261 respondents would file Form 10&hyph;K annually at 1,692.5 burden
hours per response with a total annual burden of 10,596,742.5 hours.

Form F&hyph;1 is used by foreign issuers to register securities pursuant to the federal securities laws. It is estimated
that approximately 13 respondents would file Form F&hyph;1 annually at 2,190 burden hours per response with a total
annual burden of 28,470 hours.

Form F&hyph;2 is used by foreign private issuers to register securities pursuant to the federal securities laws.
It is estimated that approximately 3 respondents would file Form F&hyph;2 annually at 764 burden hours per response
with a total annual burden of 2,292 hours.

Form F&hyph;3 is used by foreign private issuers to register securities pursuant to the federal securities laws.
It is estimated that approximately 5 respondents would file Form F&hyph;3 annually at 214 burden hours per response
with a total annual burden of 1,070 hours.

Form F&hyph;4 is used by foreign private issuers to register securities issues in connection with business combinations
pursuant to the federal securities laws. It is estimated that approximately 2 respondents would file Form F&hyph;4
annually at 1,309 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 2,618 hours.

Form 20&hyph;F elicits material information concerning the financial condition and operations of foreign private
issuers in order to permit investors to make informed investment decisions. It is estimated that approximately 133
respondents would file Form 20&hyph;F annually at 1,995 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 265,335
hours.

Regulation S&hyph;X has been assigned one burden hour for administrative convenience, since the regulation simply
prescribes the disclosure that must appear in other filings under the securities laws.

General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to OMB Clearance Officer for the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden
hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549 and OMB Clearance Officer for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Management and Budget, room 3208, New Executive Office Building,

No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Priority of Agency Orders to Cross Blocks of 25,000 Shares or More Under Rule
126(g), Commentary .01 and .02.</DOCTITLE>


May 19, 1994.


I. Introduction


On November 23, 1992, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to amend Amex Rule 126(g) relating to the priority and precedence of bids and offers. The proposed
rule specifies that agency block cross transactions,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 where both buy and sell orders are for accounts other than that of a member or member organization, can be effected without
interference at the proposed cross price. The proposal, however, would allow the cross to be broken up at a price that
is better than the proposed cross price for one side or the other. The proposed rule change is known as the ``clean cross''
proposal. On March 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in
order to increase the minimum size of agency crosses that would be entitled to priority under the proposal from 10,000
to 25,000 shares.

In a cross transaction, a member who has an order to buy and an order to sell an equivalent amount of the same stock wishes
to execute the orders against each other. Because the member already has both sides of the trade, the member does not
wish to interact with other market interest. The member, however, must comply with the provisions of Amex Rule 151
and make a public bid and offer on behalf of both sides of the cross before effecting the transaction. The offer must
be made at a price which is higher than the bid by the minimum fractional change permitted in the security. See Amex Rule
127.

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33835 (March 30, 1994),
59 FR 16247 (April 6, 1994). The Commission received no comment letters. This order approves the proposed rule change,
including Amendment No. 1.


II. Background


The Exchange's auction market procedures are codified in Amex Rule 126, which provides for the manner in which bids
and offers at the same price will be sequenced for execution. A member who makes the first bid or offer at a particular
price has ``priority'' at that price, which means that the member is the first one in the market entitled to receive
an execution at that price.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 If no member can claim priority, all members who are bidding or offering at a particular price are deemed to be on ``parity''
with each other, or equivalent in status.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 When members are on parity, a member with orders to cross blocks of 25,000 shares or more may claim ``precedence based
on size'' and thereby be entitled to the next execution at that price.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See Amex Rule 126(e)(1).

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
See Amex Rule 126(e)(2)&hyph;(4). Members are on parity with each other when two or more bids or offers are announced
simultaneously, or after a trade takes place leaving several bids or offers unfilled at the same price as the executed
trade.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>
See Amex Rule 126(g), Commentary .01.
</FOOTNOTE>


Currently, members attempting to effect a ``cross'' transaction may be required to yield either some or all of one
side of their cross in accordance with these rules. More specifically, a cross transaction may be ``broken up'' (

i.e.,

 participated in by another member) if that other member trades with either the bid or the offer side of the transaction.
The Amex states that the proposed amendments to Rule 126 would facilitate the ability of members to execute certain
types of cross transactions on the Exchange at the cross price, while still providing the opportunity in the auction
market for another member to offer price improvement to the buyer or seller, as the case may be.


III. Description of the Proposal


The Amex proposes to amend its priority rules to allow a member who has an order to buy and an order to sell 25,000 shares
or more of the same security,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 where neither order is for the account of a member or a member organization, to cross those orders at a price that is at
or within the prevailing quotation without being broken up at the cross price, irrespective of pre-existing bids
and offers at that price.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal will allow another member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross transaction to provide
a price that is better than the proposed cross price, but the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer
at a price which is the same as the cross price. Moreover, the proposal will require that the member who is providing
a better price to one side of the cross transaction must trade with all other market interest having priority at that
price before trading with any part of the cross transaction.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
8

</FOOTNAME>
Amendment No. 1, 

supra

 note 4, increased the minimum size of a ``clean cross'' to 25,000 shares.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
9

</FOOTNAME>
The Amex will continue to require that the member follow the crossing procedures of Amex Rule 151 and make a public bid
and offer on behalf of both sides of the cross. See 

supra

, note 3. Unlike existing block cross procedures under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01, See 

infra

 note 11, orders to be crossed under proposed Rule 126(g), Commentary .02 will not be required to be on parity with other
orders on the floor; that is it will not be required that the priority of earlier bids and offers first be removed, by
means of a sale, before effecting the cross.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
10

</FOOTNAME>
The proposal also will require that transactions effected at the cross price in reliance on Commentary .02 be printed
as ``stopped stock.''

<PARENT> FR940526-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To avoid conflict with the Amex's proposed clean cross rule, as discussed above, Commentary .01 to Rule 126(g) will
be amended so as to afford size precedence to orders to cross 25,000 shares or more only when members or member organizations
are involved as principal on one or both sides of the cross. In addition, the amendments to Commentary .01 will clarify
that such orders to cross are entitled to precedence only when they are on parity with other orders on the Floor (

i.e.

, both sides of the cross must be represented at the specialist's post when a sale clearing the floor takes place).
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
11

</FOOTNAME>
In this respect, size precedence differs from priority. See 

supra

 note 9.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Amex states that the proposal is intended to facilitate the execution of agency cross transactions on the Exchange.
According to the Amex, confining the proposed size priority threshold to block size orders of 25,000 shares or more
will limit the effects of the rule primarily to actively traded, liquid securities. In addition, the Exchange states
that the proposal furthers the important auction market principle of price improvement by allowing another member
to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross price.
The Amex also suggests that the proposal preserves the auction market principle of priority by requiring that a member
who wants to break up a cross by providing a better price must first satisfy all other market interest having priority
at that better price before trading with any part of the cross transaction.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objective(s) of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.



IV. Discussion



The Amex clean cross proposal is designed to facilitate the execution of cross transactions on the Exchange. As discussed
below, due to the Amex's current priority rules, some Amex members have developed the practice of transporting cross
trades to the regional exchanges for execution, avoiding exposure to the Amex's active trading crowd and to limit
orders on the Amex's specialists' books. The clean cross proposal, in contrast, should encourage Amex members to
execute their cross transactions on the Amex because the proposal will allow a member who has a customer order to buy
and a customer order to sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security to cross those orders at a price that is at or within
the prevailing quotation, irrespective of pre-existing bids or offers at that price. The proposal will allow another
member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross
price, but the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price.
Moreover, the proposal will uphold traditional auction market principles of priority and price improvement because
it will require that the member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross must trade with all other market
interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross.

The Commission recognizes that the Amex's clean cross proposal was prompted by the competition that exists between
the Amex and the regional exchanges for order flow and, in particular, for block business. The Commission also recognizes
that the Amex's current priority rules may restrict the ability of Amex members to execute agency block cross transactions
on the Exchange. Under the current rules, a member who tries to execute a block-sized agency cross on the Amex faces
the possibility that another member will break up the cross at the cross price. As a result, the member may take block-sized
orders in Amex-listed securities to a regional stock exchange for execution. The relatively smaller number of limit
orders on the books of the regional stock exchange specialists and the virtual absence of a trading crowd at the regional
exchanges helps to ensure that member firms will be able to execute their cross transactions on the regional exchanges
with little or no interference. Indeed, the regional exchanges compete aggressively with the Amex for block transactions.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, blocks go to the regional exchanges because of the low probability that a block will be broken up on the
regional exchange.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
12

</FOOTNAME>
See 

infra,

 note 15.

</FOOTNOTE>


The clean cross proposal should facilitate the ability of Amex members to execute block agency cross transactions
on the Amex by giving such orders priority over orders at or within the prevailing quotation. At the same time, the proposal
preserves the auction market principle of price improvement by permitting the cross transaction to be broken up at
a better price. The proposal also preserves the principle of priority by requiring that a member who breaks up a cross
by providing a better price must first satisfy all existing market interest having priority at that better price before
trading with any part of the cross.

The Commission recognizes that approval of the clean cross proposal could disadvantage orders on the book, or in the
trading crowd, at the same price as the cross transaction. This is the only aspect of the proposal that really represents
a departure from existing auction market principles. Thus, under the proposal, a clean cross could be executed while
a public investor's limit order on the book remains unexecuted. For example, if a public customer left a limit order
on the specialist's book at 10 a.m., bidding for 500 shares of 

XYZ

 at 40, a so-called clean cross could be executed at 10:10 at a price of 40 without satisfying the public customer order.

The Commission recognizes that the Amex proposal may not be the ideal means to address the current situation, in which
a block transaction can be effected on one of the regional stock exchanges or in the third market and completely avoid
the Amex's limit order book. A preferable approach would be to establish a means of intermarket price protection for
all limit orders in all market centers.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 However, with no means of intermarket price protection for public limit order, and given Commission approval of the
NYSE's identical clean cross proposal,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 as well as certain regional exchange proposals designed to minimize interference with cross transactions,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 it could be unfair to preclude the Amex from adapting to the present competitive environment by facilitating the execution
of agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Thus, the Commission believes that it is not unreasonable or inconsistent
with the Act for the Amex to react to competitive pressures for block business by permitting large agency crosses to
occur at or within the bid or offer price. The proposed rule change should further competition among exchanges and
other competing market centers and increase opportunities for the more efficient execution of block-sized agency
cross transactions.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission originally attempted to address the underlying issues of limit order protection and competition
among the exchanges through an integrated national market system rule. Specifically, the Commission proposed Rule
11Ac1&hyph;3 under the Act in 1979 to require that all limit orders that are collected in a particular market center
receive intermarket price protection against executions at inferior prices. See Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 15770 (April 26, 1979), 44 FR 26692 (addressing the practice of transporting block orders from one market to another
to avoid limit orders in the former market). Due to the lack of interest from the relevant markets and potential difficulties
in implementing a system for intermarket price protection, the Commission withdrew proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3.
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31344 (October 21, 1992), 57 FR 48581 (October 27, 1992).

As described above, members who do not believe that they can execute their block-sized agency orders on the Amex currently
take their orders to the regional stock exchanges, completely avoiding exposure to limit orders on the Amex specialist's
book. The Commission believes that approval of the proposal will not result in incremental harm to public customers.
Assume, for example, that the market in XYZ is quoted 201/4 bid, 203/8 offer, 100,000 shares by 100,000 shares. Investor
A has a limit buy order on the book at 201/4 for 1,000 shares of XYZ. In today's environment, a member intending to effect
a 100,000 share agency cross transaction at a price of 201/4 could go to another market to execute the cross, thereby
avoiding exposure to Investor A's limit buy order of 201/4. As a result of the proposed rule change, the member would,
to comply with Rule 151, bid 201/4 for 100,000 shares and offer 100,000 shares at 203/8 on the Amex floor. The member's
100,000 share clean cross of 201/4 would have priority, and the cross could not be broken up at that price. Although
Investor A's limit buy order would not be executed, this is the same result as if the block was done on another market
under the Amex's current rules.

The commission also believes that the proposal restricts sufficiently the circumstances in which members may execute
clean cross transactions on the Exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the share size threshold of
25,000 shares or more should help to ensure that the clean cross proposal will apply primarily to larger block-sized
orders where the depth of the prevailing bid or offer may be less likely to satisfy either side of the clean cross. In
addition, because the proposal is limited to non-member orders only, the proposal should assist public customers
in effecting cross transactions on the Amex and should not give any special advantage to members and member organizations
in their proprietary trading.

Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed amendments to Commentary .01 will eliminate potential confusion
by specifying that the Amex's existing size precedence rule does not apply to those agency crosses of 25,000 shares
which can be executed pursuant to Commentary .02. The Commission also has concluded that the Amex proposal will clarify
the procedures for claiming precedence based on size, and should help to ensure that bids or offers with priority are
not disadvantaged.



V. Conclusion



For the above reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, as amended, is not inconsistent with
Sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act.

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Description of the Proposal


A. Cross-Netting Under Previous Rules


Under OCC and ICC rules, a joint clearing member (

i.e.,

 a clearing member which is a clearing member of both OCC and ICC) may elect to cross-net its OCC exercise and assignment
settlement obligations in OCC-cleared foreign currency options (``OCC obligations'') with its delivery obligations
in ICC-cleared foreign currency futures (``ICC obligations'') on the same foreign currency. Cross-netting occurs
when OCC obligations settle on a date that also is a delivery date for ICC obligations. Because such dates coincide
only one day each month, cross-netting is performed only one day each month.
Previously, a joint clearing member that had elected to settle by cross-netting selected either OCC or ICC as its designated
clearing organization (``DCO'') and settled its cross-netted obligations with its DCO in accordance with the rules
of the DCO. (OCC and ICC have virtually identical rules regarding the settlement of foreign currency obligations.)
The DCO, in turn, performed its ordinary clearance and settlement activities and acted as agent for the other clearing
organization in settling the cross-netted obligations.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
For a more detailed description of cross-netting, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24781 (August 6, 1987),
53 FR 30268 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;86&hyph;14].
</FOOTNOTE>


The agreement by one clearing organization to act as agent for the other was contained in the Mutual Agency Agreement
for Foreign Currency Settlement (``Mutual Agency Agreement'') between OCC and ICC. The Mutual Agency Agreement
set forth the rights and obligations of OCC and ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements and the effect of the default
of a joint clearing member on such rights and obligations.


B. Cross-Netting Under Newly Approved Rules


ICC no longer desires to be a cross-netting DCO; therefore, OCC and ICC are eliminating the ability of a joint clearing
member to select ICC as a DCO. These rule changes will have no effect: (1) On the basic procedures under which cross-netted
obligations are settled or (2) upon any joint clearing member because no joint clearing member currently or has ever
selected ICC as its cross-netting DCO.
To accomplish the rule changes, OCC and ICC are amending OCC Rule 1605(c) and ICC Rule 1205(c). The two rules deal with
the cross-netting of foreign currency obligations and are being modified to state that henceforth joint clearing
members can only designate OCC to act on their behalf with respect to cross-netting settlement. OCC and ICC also are
deleting from OCC By-Laws Article XV, Section 1 and from ICC Rule 1202 the term and definition of ``designated clearing
organization.''
OCC and ICC are replacing the existing Mutual Agency Agreement with the Agreement for Cross-Netting Foreign Currency
Settlements (``Cross-Netting Agreement''). The Cross-Netting Agreement, which is based on the Mutual Agency Agreement,
has been drafted by OCC and ICC to implement the above-described rule changes. Specifically, the Cross-Netting Agreement
provides that: (1) OCC and ICC will furnish a form notice by which a joint clearing member may elect to cross-net its
OCC and ICC obligations and which will provide that only OCC will effect the cross-netted settlements; (2) OCC agrees
to act as agent for ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements with a joint clearing member; and (3) neither OCC nor
ICC will change its rules relating to the margining and to the settling of foreign currency obligations without the
consent of the other. The Cross-Netting Agreement also sets forth settlement, default, indemnity, and termination
procedures. Those procedures are basically unchanged from the Mutual Agency Agreement except for modifications
made to reflect that only OCC can effect cross-netted settlement.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds in the custody or control
of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. The proposed modifications to the OCC and ICC rules, in essence,
eliminate a cross-netting option that has never been used. Accordingly, the rule changes should have no significant
effect on either OCC's or ICC's ability to safeguard securities or funds.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Applications to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Winstar Communications, Inc., Common
Stock, $.01 Par Value; Series A Redeemable Common Stock Purchase Warrants; Series B Redeemable Common Stock Purchase
Warrants) File No. 1&hyph;10726</DOCTITLE>



May 20, 1994.



Winstar Communications, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the Boston
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, its Common Stock, Series A &amp; B Redeemable Common Stock Purchase Warrants are listed
on the BSE and quoted in the NASDAQ SmallCap Market under the symbols ``WCII,'' ``WCIIW'' and ``WCIIZ,'' respectively.
The Company now seeks to withdraw the securities from listing on the BSE.

According to the Company, the decision to withdraw the securities is based on the limited and sporadic trading activity
of the securities on the BSE since the date of listing. The Company's primary trading market has been and continues
to be the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. The Company believes that the benefits of remaining listed on the BSE do not outweigh
the costs involved in maintaining such listing, since the NASDAQ SmallCap Market represents the primary trading
market for the securities.

Any interested person may, on or before June 13, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

note), popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. In order
to share ``straw man'' implementation proposals specific to carrier manifest requirements and entry and clearance
procedures, remote filing, and general order procedures, and to invite informal dialogue relative to implementation
plans and issues, Customs will hold open meetings in (1) Buffalo, New York, on June 21, 1994, at the Radisson Hotel and

<DOCTITLE>Summary of Precedent Opinions of the General Counsel </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is publishing a summary of legal interpretations issued by the Department's
General Counsel involving veterans' benefits under laws administered by VA. These interpretations are considered
precedential by VA and will be followed by VA officials and employees in future claims matters. It is being published
to provide the public, and, in particular, veterans' benefit claimants and their representatives, with notice of
VA's interpretation regarding the legal matter at issue.



</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Jane L. Lehman, Chief, Law Library, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420,
(202) 273&hyph;6558.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

VA regulations at 38 CFR 2.6(e)(9) and 14.507 authorize the Department's General Counsel to issue written legal opinions
having precedential effect in adjudications and appeals involving veterans' benefits under laws administered
by VA. The General Counsel's interpretations on legal matters, contained in such opinions, are conclusive as to all
VA officials and employees not only in the matter at issue but also in future adjudications and appeals, in the absence
of a change in controlling statute or regulation or a superseding written legal opinion of the General Counsel. 


VA publishes summaries of such opinions in order to provide the public with notice of those interpretations of the
General Counsel which must be followed in future benefit matters and to assist veterans' benefit claimants and their
representatives in the prosecution of benefit claims. The full text of such opinions, with personal identifiers
deleted, may be obtained by contacting the VA official named above. 


O.G.C. Precedent 1&hyph;94


Question Presented 




Whether, in computing annual income for improved pension purposes, the $2,000 exclusion provided by 25 U.S.C. 1407
for certain Native American tribal per-capita payments applies to the sum of all payments received during an annual
reporting period or applies to each individual payment received during the reporting period. 


Held



For purposes of computing annual income under the improved-pension statutes, 25 U.S.C. 1407 authorizes the exclusion
from a claimant's income of no more than $2,000 of the aggregate amount received during the relevant twelve-month
period as per capita distributions from a Native-American tribal trust fund. 

Effective date: January 19, 1994. 


O.G.C. Precedent 2&hyph;94


Question Presented



Does a temporary total relating based on convalescence, under 38 CFR 4.30, satisfy the requirement in 38 U.S.C. 1114(s)
of a disability rated as total for entitlement to special monthly compensation? 


Held 



The plain and unambiguous language of 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) does not restrict the nature of total ratings that may serve
as a basis of entitlement to the special rate of disability compensation which section 1114(s) authorizes. A temporary
total rating based on convalescence, under 38 CFR 4.30, satisfies the requirement in section 1114(s) of a disability
rated as total. 

Effective date: February 2, 1994. 


O.G.C. Precedent 3&hyph;94


Question Presented



May the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) consolidate monthly benefits of National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)
beneficiaries into one annual payment in order to protect against misuse of benefit checks?


Held 



No statutory authority exists which would allow VA to accumulate monthly NSLI benefits, other than monthly payments
of less than $5 on policies which matured prior to August 1, 1946, into a single annual payment. 

Effective date: February 8, 1994.


O.G.C. Precedent 4&hyph;94


Question Presented


Under what circumstances may withheld pension benefits be paid to the children of a veteran's surviving spouse (now
deceased) where the surviving spouse's benefits were withheld due to the surviving spouse's residence in the People's
Republic of China? 


Held 



a. Following the death of a veteran's surviving spouse, payment of pension benefits withheld from the surviving spouse
under 31 U.S.C. 3329 (which bars sending Government checks to certain foreign countries) and deposited in the special
deposit account in the Department of the Treasury is governed by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3330 (c) and (d). Under
section 3330(d)(1)(A), payment of such benefits is precluded where a claim is not filed within one year following
the surviving spouse's death. Further, under 31 U.S.C. 3330(d)(2), payment may only be made on the basis of a rating
or decision existing at the time of the surviving spouse's death.

b. After the death of the surviving spouse, amounts withheld due to the surviving spouse's foreign residence and deposited
in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3330(b), and amounts not paid as a result of 38 U.S.C.
5308 (which bars payment of non-contractual veterans' benefits to aliens located in the territory of an enemy of the
United States), may only be paid in accordance with the accrued-benefit provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5121. Those provisions
require that an application have been filed within one year of the surviving spouse's death. They also limit benefits
to those to which the surviving spouse was entitled at death based on existing ratings or decisions or on evidence in
the file on the date of death and only authorize payment of benefits due and unpaid for a period not to exceed one year.

Effective date: February 8, 1994.



O.G.C. Precedent 5&hyph;94



Questions Presented



How, if at all, are the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5101(a), 5110(a), and 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114(a) to be applied in establishing
an effective date for service connection of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) based on an original claim made pursuant
to 38 CFR 3.313?



Held



An effective date for service connection of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma under 38 CFR 3.313 may generally be based on the
date of receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs of an original claim for that benefit filed on or after August
5, 1964, regardless of whether the claim had previously been denied, if the claimant was otherwise eligible on the
date of claim. As a practical matter, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114(a) permitting payment of
retroactive benefits for periods prior to the date of receipt of a claim under certain circumstances could not be applicable
in determining the effective date of an award of service connection under &sect;3.313 because no one could have met
all eligibility requirements for benefits under &sect;3.313 on its effective date of August 5, 1964.

Effective date: February 18, 1994.



O.G.C. Precedent 6&hyph;94



Questions Presented



a. Prior to March 10, 1976, did Diagnostic Code 5296 contain a system for rating skull loss under which single skull
holes were rated exclusively by comparison to coin size and multiple skull holes were rated exclusively based on reference
to a specified area in square inches?

b. If so, what was the rationale for such a system and was it legally supportable?



Held



a. Former Diagnostic Code 5296, as in effect prior to March 10, 1976, established a bifurcated system of assigning
disability ratings for partial skull loss, under which ratings could be assigned either on the basis of the aggregate
of two or more areas of skull loss or on the size of a single area of skull loss. Prior to the 1976 revision, this diagnostic
code provided for assignment of a 50-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more areas of skull loss whose aggregate
area exceeded 2 square inches, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was greater in size than a 50-cent piece.
Similarly, the prior provisions of the diagnostic code provided a 30-percent rating where: (1) There were two or more
areas of skull loss whose aggregate area exceeded 1 square inch, or (2) there was a single area of skull loss which was
greater in size than a 25-cent piece.

<TEXT>
 

b. The establishment of such rating criteria necessarily implies a finding that a single area of skull loss greater
than a specified size was considered to represent a greater impairment of earning capacity than two or more smaller
areas having a greater aggregate area. We cannot conclude that establishment of such criteria was outside the scope
of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs' discretion under statutory provisions authorizing establishment of
a rating schedule.
Effective date: February 24, 1994.


O.G.C. Precedent 7&hyph;94


Question Presented


Does the amount of a Federal Tort Claims Act settlement to be set off against benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151 include
the amount of attorney fees paid out of the settlement proceeds?


Held


When an individual is awarded a judgment or enters into a compromise on a Federal Tort Claims Act claim subject to 38
U.S.C. 1151, that individual's future veterans' disability compensation benefits based on the same disability
must be offset by the entire amount of the judgment or settlement proceeds, including the amount of any attorney fees
paid out of such proceeds.
Effective date: March 1, 1994.


O.G.C. Precedent 8&hyph;94


Questions Presented


a. If no claim has been filed under the Vocational Rehabilitation program authorized by chapter 31, title 38, United
States Code, does Vocational Rehabilitation Service, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) have statutory authority
to evaluate a veteran for purposes of determining the individual's eligibility for compensation benefits under
chapter 11, title 38, United States Code?
b. If such statutory authority exists, is an implementing regulation also required pursuant to section 501(a)(3),
title 38, United States Code?
c. If Vocational Rehabilitation Service within VBA does not have statutory authority to provide a rehabilitation
assessment for purposes of the VA compensation benefits program, is there statutory and regulatory authority for
requesting an equivalent VA examination (

e.g.,

 a fee-basis consultation by a psychologist who specializes in vocational assessments)?


Held


a. Vocational Rehabilitation evaluations conducted under authority of chapter 31, title 38, United States Code,
may be provided only to eligible persons applying for benefits under that chapter and only for the specific purposes
of that chapter.
b. The Secretary has authority under section 501(a)(3), title 38, United States Code, to conduct a ``vocational rehabilitation
assessment'' for purposes of determining the existence of facts to support an IU rating. Further, 38 U.S.C. 512 authorizes
the Secretary to delegate to any VA component the responsibility for making such assessments.
c. Under 38 U.S.C. 513, the Secretary theoretically may, subject to procurement rules, contract with third parties
for such assessments if he deems them to be necessary for proper administration of the compensation benefits program.
However, as noted in the [Office of General Counsel unpublished decision, dated July 25, 1988], the Congress has previously
considered and failed to enact legislation mandating use of such assessments. Therefore, Congress may perceive
that administrative implementation of such a requirement by the Secretary is an attempt to circumvent the legislative
will of Congress by providing for a procedure which the latter, to date, has rejected.
d. If the Secretary elects to exercise all or any of the statutory authority cited in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this holding,
the Secretary must, as a prerequisite, promulgate appropriate implementing regulations consistent therewith
and with the dictates of due process. In particular, substantive regulations first would have to be promulgated detailing
the scope, purpose, criteria for, and potential legal effect of such assessments and should include a delegation
of the task of administering the requirement to a particular agency activity.
e. As to the case which precipitated this inquiry, we believe that the assessment agreed to by the parties and incorporated
in the COVA remand may be conducted on an ad hoc basis by any agency activity competent to do so as informally designated
by the Secretary. Absent such a consensual arrangement, however, and without appropriate regulatory authority,
imposing that assessment on a case-by-case basis would violate due process and would be ultra vires. Moreover, absent
a policy determination on the use of an employability assessment in deciding IU claims, and absent appropriate regulations,
administrative procedures, and delegation of authority implementing such a policy, we would recommend against
inviting or encouraging even consensual use of the assessment on an ad hoc basis in future cases. Among other legal
concerns, such action could provoke claims of unequal treatment under the law.
Effective date: March 25, 1994.


O.G.C. Precedent 9&hyph;94


Question Presented


Do decisions of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals (CVA or court) invalidating Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
regulations or statutory interpretations have retroactive effect?


Held


Decisions of the CVA invalidating VA regulations or statutory interpretations do not have retroactive effect in
relation to prior ``final'' adjudications of claims, but should be given retroactive effect as they relate to claims
still open on direct review.
Effective date: March 25, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Advisory Committee for Cooperative Studies, Health Services, and Rehabilitation Research and Development Subcommittee
on Scientific Review and Evaluation for Health Services Research and Development Service; Meeting </DOCTITLE>



The Department of Veteran Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, gives notice under Public Law 92&hyph;463,
that a meeting of the Advisory Committee for Cooperative Studies, Health Service, and Rehabilitation Research and
Development Subcommittee on Scientific Review and Evaluation for Health Services Research and Development will
be held at The Best Western Boston, Inn at Children's, 342 Longwood Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, June 1 through
June 3, 1994. The session on June 1, 1994, is scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. and end at 5 p.m. The sessions scheduled for
June 2 and 3 are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review research and development
applications concerned with the measurement and evaluation of health care systems and with testing new methods of
health care delivery and management. Applications are reviewed for scientific and technical merit and recommendations
regarding their funding are prepared for the Associate Chief Medical Director for Research and Development. 

The meeting will be open to the public (to the seating capacity of the room) at the start of the June 1 session for approximately
one hour to cover administrative matters and to discuss the general status of the program. The closed portion of the
meeting involves discussion, examination, reference to, and oral review of staff and consultant critiques of research
protocols, and similar documents. During this portion of the meeting, discussion and recommendations will deal
with qualifications of personnel conducting the studies, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy, as well as research information, the premature disclosure of which would be likely
to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action regarding such research projects. As provided
by the subsection 10(d) of Public Law 92&hyph;463, as amended by Public Law 94&hyph;409, closing portions of these
meetings is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(6) and (9)(B). 

Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should contact Mr. Bill, Judy,
Review Program Manager (12B3), Health Services Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs,
810 Vermont Avenue, Washington, DC 20420 (phone: 202&hyph;523&hyph;7425) at least five days before the meeting.

the Securities and Exchange Commission will hold the following meetings during the week of May 30, 1994.
An open meeting will be held on Wednesday, June 1, 1994, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 1C30. A closed meeting will be held on Wednesday,
June 1, 1994, following the open meeting.
Commissioners, Counsel to the Commissioners, the Secretary to the Commission, and recording secretaries will attend
the closed meeting. Certain staff members who have an interest in the matters may also be present.
The General Counsel of the Commission, or his designee, has certified that, in his opinion, one or more of the exemptions
set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (4), (8), (9)(A) and (10) and 17 CFR 200.402(a) (4), (8), (9)(i) and (10), permit consideration

Commissioner Schapiro, as duty officer, voted to consider the items listed for the closed meeting in a closed session.

The subject matter of the open meeting scheduled for Wednesday, June 1, 1994, at 10:00 a.m., will be: 



Consideration of proposed rule 3a12&hyph;11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') exempting
debt securities listed on a national securities exchange from the restrictions on borrowing of Section 8(a) and the
proxy, shareholder communications, and information statement rules of Sections 14(a), 14(b), and 14(c) of the Exchange
Act. Other proposed amendments would provide for the automatic effectiveness of Form 8&hyph;A registration statements
for listed debt securities and the elimination of the filing fee associated with Form 8&hyph;A registration statements
for listed debt. The Commission will also consider whether to authorize a one-step filing procedure for Exchange
Act registration on a combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application for debt securities that are to be listed on a national

Report on Summer 1993 Surveys Used To Determine Cost-of-Living Allowances in Selected Nonforeign Areas





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice publishes the ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Hawaii, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, and in the Washington, DC, Area, March 1994,'' prepared by Runzheimer
International under Government contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. This report provides the basis for the increases
in certain cost-of-living allowances (COLA's) being proposed by OPM in the notice of proposed rulemaking immediately
preceding this notice.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Consistent with the deadline on comments in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking immediately preceding
this notice, OPM requests that comments on the report be submitted on or before July 25, 1994.




</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Send or deliver comments to Allan G. Hearne, Methodology Development Branch, Office of Compensation Policy, Personnel
Systems and Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, room 6H31, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415.



</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Allan G. Hearne, (202) 606&hyph;2838.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 5 CFR 591.206(c), COLA survey summaries must be published in the 

Federal Register

. Accordingly, OPM is publishing the complete ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Hawaii, Guam and the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Virgin Islands, and the Washington, DC, Area, March 1994,''
produced by Runzheimer International. The Runzheimer report describes the surveys that were conducted for OPM in
the summer of 1993 in Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Washington, DC, area. It also explains
in detail the methodologies, calculations, and findings.



OPM is publishing the survey results at this time to expedite the implementation of potential COLA rate adjustments.
This notice does not cover the winter 1994 living-cost surveys conducted in Alaska. The results of the winter 1994
surveys will be published in a separate notice later this year after OPM has fully analyzed the results of the Alaska
surveys.

Based on the summer 1993 living-cost surveys, Runzheimer computed index values of relative living costs in allowance
areas using an index scale where the living costs in the Washington, DC, area are set at 100. (See the Executive summary
of the March 1994 Runzheimer report accompanying this notice.) OPM notes that the summer surveys indicated that COLA
rates in three allowance areas are above levels otherwise warranted. However, the Treasury, Postal Service, and
General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141), bars any reduction in COLA rates through December
31, 1995. Thus, the only rate adjustments to be made are rate increases, as described in the notice of proposed rulemaking
immediately preceding this notice.

Executive Summary



This report culminates the fourth living-cost comparison study undertaken by Runzheimer International for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. The contract requires Runzheimer
to:

(1) Survey living costs in 7 cost-of-living allowance (COLA) areas and the Washington, DC, area, and 

(2) Compare living costs between the areas and the DC area.

To determine living costs in the identified areas and build this report, Runzheimer researched over 3,000 outlets
and gathered more than 12,000 price quotes.

This report presents the results of the living-cost surveys conducted during the summer of 1993. The results of the
winter 1994 living-cost surveys will be presented in a subsequent report to be provided to OPM in mid-1994.

To ease interpretation of the research results, we display the outcome of the comparisons as living-cost indexes
in the table below. In addition, the table shows living-cost indexes for federal employees who have unlimited access
to commissary and exchange facilities because of their employment. The index for the Washington, DC, area (not shown)
is 100.00 because it is, by definition, the reference area.

One of the changes OPM requested this year was to separate the reporting of the summer and winter living-cost surveys.
As noted earlier, this has been done. The purpose of this change was to allow OPM to adjust COLA where warranted in a more
timely manner.

Another change was to combine the St. Croix and St. Thomas, Virgin Island, data to form a single index for the U.S. Virgin
Islands. This change was made to address concerns about the quantity of data, obtained in the Virgin Islands. Combining
the two areas significantly increases the data base and improves price comparisons.

For the 1993 summer surveys, OPM asked Runzheimer to change of its data collection procedures and data analyses relative
to last year's surveys. Runzheimer also initiated other changes with OPM's approval. Some of these changes included:

&bull;Using a moving average approach to introduce new Federal employment weights;

&bull;Increasing the quantity of housing data obtained in certain areas_most notably parts of the Virgin Islands;

&bull;Making minor changes in pricing sources for certain items to refine the comparisons of D.C. and allowance area
prices;

&bull;Taking into account the effects of the earthquake in Guam by ensuring that goods &amp; services pricing_most
notably fresh produce_was not abnormally skewed;

&bull;Taking into account the effects of Hurricane Iniki in Kauai by ensuring that prices_particularly housing
costs_were not abnormally skewed;

&bull;Employing a new methodology for collecting and analyzing Virgin Island, Guam, and Puerto Rico automobile
insurance rates; and

&bull;Employing a new methodology for determining automobile maintenance costs.

In addition, to monitor, fine-tune, and maintain effective control of the data-gathering efforts in both the Pacific
and Caribbean regions, two of Runzheimer's senior research staff traveled to these regions to visit retail outlets,
Runzheimer research associates, housing data sources, and living communities.

We discuss these and other adjustments in appropriate sections throughout this report.



Report to OPM on Living Costs in Hawaii, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S.
Virgin Islands, and in the Washington, DC Area



1. Introduction



1.1&blank;Report Objectives



This comprehensive report culminates data-gathering and research work undertaken in 1993 as required by Task 2 of
contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705 between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Runzheimer International.
The report details the results of Runzheimer International's surveys of over 3,000 outlets to obtain more than 12,000
price quotes and the analyses of the data.

This is the fourth report Runzheimer has produced for OPM under this contract. In 1990, in fulfillment of Task 1 of the
contract, Runzheimer worked with OPM to design a model for estimating comparative living costs between the allowance
areas and the Washington, D.C., area. Task 2 of the contract required that Runzheimer apply the model by conducting
living-cost surveys, analyzing the results, and developing living-cost comparative indexes. On February 26, 1991,
OPM published that model and the results of the first surveys conducted under the model in the Federal Register

. On December 10, 1992, OPM published in the 

Federal Register

 the second report, which covered the summer 1991 and winter 1992 surveys. On August 30, 1993, OPM published in the 

Federal Register

 the next report that covered the summer 1992 and winter 1993 surveys.

Unlike previous reports, this report provides only the results of the summer 1993 surveys. This change was made to
allow OPM the opportunity to adjust COLA rates where warranted in a more timely manner. Results of the 1994 winter surveys
(i.e., the Alaska surveys) will be presented in a separate report to be provided to OPM in mid-1994.

The analyses in this report establish the comparative cost differences between the allowance areas listed below
and the Washington, D.C., area. By law, Washington, D.C., is the base of ``reference'' area for the nonforeign-area
COLA program.

Under OPM regulations, federal civilian employees who have unlimited access to commissaries and post exchanges
due to their employment by the government may receive a different allowance rate than other federal employees. This
regulation does not apply to federal employees who have limited access or unlimited access for other reasons_e.g.,
being married to active or retired military personnel.

Task 2 of the OPM contract also required Runzheimer International to calculate comparative living costs in the areas
listed below and the Washington, D.C., area for federal civilian employees who have access to military commissaries
and post exchanges.




1. City and County of Honolulu, HI
2. Guam/CNMI
3. Puerto Rico



1.2&blank;Changes in This Year's Survey



Runzheimer and OPM made several changes to the surveys and analyses, including_

&bull;reporting the results of the summer and winter surveys separately;

&bull;using a moving average approach to introduce new Federal employment weights;

&bull;combining St. Croix and St. Thomas data to produce indexes for the Virgin Islands as a whole;

&bull;increasing the sample size of housing information in several areas, including Hawaii, San Juan, St. Croix,
and the Maryland suburbs of the Washington, D.C., area;

&bull;developing a percent-to-market value formula to calculate real estate taxes for San Juan because tax assessment
data were no longer available as a result of a decentralization of property tax function in Puerto Rico;

&bull;increasing the comparability of automobile insurance in the Virgin Islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico, compared
with the Washington, D.C., area;

&bull;surveying only the cash price at branded gas stations unless only non-branded stations are available; and

&bull;more accurately defining the distinguishing differences between family dining and fine dining.

Runzheimer has continued to include catalog sales in its survey. Since the Sears catalogs have been discontinued.
Runzheimer has researched hundreds of catalogs to determine which are most appropriate. Runzheimer researchers
found that most catalogs have uniform shipping charges. Only catalogs that sell merchandise in the allowance areas
and the Washington, D.C., area were used.

Appendix 3 identifies Goods &amp; Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing Related pricing changes. Current
housing data can be found in appendix 9A and Appendix 9B. Other changes are discussed where applicable in the report.



1.3&blank;Pricing Period



Consistent with last year's tropical-area surveys. Runzheimer collected data for the Hawaii, Guam/CNMI, Puerto
Rico, and Virgin Islands allowance areas (and the Washington, D.C., area) in August, September, and October of 1993,
pricing most items during August. Also during August, our research associates priced durable goods, such as cars,
and, in October, items such as homeowner insurance, which depend on the pricing of other items (i.e., housing).

To ensure consistent seasonable catalog pricing, Runzehimer used spring/summer catalogs for the catalog items
covered in these surveys.



1.4&blank;Living Cost Components



In accordance with federal regulations, expense components Runzheimer costed to develop analyses, comparisons,
and the report were:





1. Housing and Housing Related Expenses
2. Transportation
3. Consumption Goods &amp; Services
4. Miscellaneous Expenses






Runzehimer factored sales, excise and property taxes into the analysis where applicable. However, in keeping with
previous reports, we did not factor federal, state and local income taxes into the analysis. Because income taxes
significantly affect living-cost analyses, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes
in future surveys.

Educational opportunities vary significantly among locations in terms of availability, quality, and other factors.
Runzheimer analyst and OPM officials agree that, without additional information, attempts to measure cost differences
in education in the selected areas would be highly subjective and would not add to the integrity of the model. Therefore,
education expense is not included in the model or surveys.

2. Overall Model



2.1&blank;Measurement of Living-Cost Differences



The most common and most widely accepted way to measure living-cost differences between and among locations is to
select representative items that people purchase in these locations and to calculate the respective cost differences,
combining them according to their importance to one another (as measured by relative percentage of expenditures).
Runzheimer applied this methodology to compare the living costs in each of the allowance areas with the living costs
in the Washington, D.C. area.

To move from this basic concept to computing comparative living costs between each allowance area and the Washington,
D.C., area, Runzheimer followed five main processes or steps:

Step 1&blank;Identify the segment of the population for which this analysis is being targeted (i.e., the target population).

Step 2&blank;Determine how these people spend their money.

Step 3&blank;Select items to represent the expense categories for which these people spend their money.

Step 4&blank;Conduct pricing surveys of the selected items in each area.

Step 5&blank;Analyze cost ratios for the selected items and aggregate them according to the relative importance
of each item.



2.1.1&blank;Target Population: Federal Employees



Runzheimer's living-cost model measures living-cost differences for non-military Federal employees having annual
base salaries between $10,000 and $80,000, the salary range of the 1990 General Schedule (GS) of the Federal Government.
Because living-cost differences may vary depending on an employee's income level, Runzheimer designed its analytical
model to identify living costs at three income levels.

In its first report to OPM, Runzheimer used the salary distribution of all General Schedule employees as of March 31,
1990, which OPM supplied, to determine the income levels that most accurately represent the Federal employee population.
After analyzing the array of salary data, Runzheimer picked the midpoints of the lower, middle and upper thirds of
the distribution as its three income levels ($18,000, $28,400 and $45,200 respectively).

Runzheimer applied the same income levels for this report as it did for the first. In previous reports, Runzheimer
recommended that OPM consider introducing changes in income levels and weights on a gradual basis. OPM agreed, and
this year OPM introduced new Federal employment weights that are based on a moving average. OPM has informed Runzheimer
that OPM plans to introduce other changes, such as in the representative income levels and Consumer Expenditure Survey
(CES) weights, in future surveys.

Runzheimer uses Federal employment weights in the model in two ways: (1) to combine survey data from multiple survey
areas within a single allowance area and (2) to combine relative living costs by income level within each allowance
area into a single index for the area (as required by section 591.205(c) of title 5, Code of Federal regulations).

OPM's moving average allows the gradual introduction of new employment distribution data over time. The weights
are based on a three-year average of GS employment. Each year, the latest GS employment data will be added to the three-year
average, the oldest data will be deleted, and a new three-year average will be computed. This will keep the weights
current while mitigating any fluctuations due to short-term changes in Federal employment.

In this first application of the moving average, OPM is departing slightly from the process described above in that
the three employment distributions used are for the periods of 1990, 1992, and 1993. The 1990 rather than 1991 employment
distribution is used because the model previously used 1990 data only. (See Appendix 13.)



2.1.2&blank;Determination of Expenditure Patterns

2.1.2.1&blank;Source of Expenditure Data



Conforming with last year's process, Runzheimer used the ``prepub'' statistical reports from the 1988 CES dated
February 13, 1990 (see Appendix 1) as the basis for weighting expenditure patterns.



2.1.2.2&blank;Income Level Adjustments



Because the CES reflected 1988 expenditure levels, Runzheimer reduced the three 1990 incomes back to 1988 levels
before beginning the expenditure analysis. To calculate estimated 1988 income levels, Runzheimer used the average
percentage salary increases of Federal employees for the two-year period in question as supplied by OPM officials
(4.1% increase 1988&hyph;89 and 3.6% increase 1989&hyph;90, resulting in a 7.85% two-year increase). This adjustment
reduced the 1990 income levels to estimated 1988 levels of $16,700, $26,300, and $41,900.

2.1.2.3&blank;Family Size Considerations



A family size of 2.6 was inherent in the weighting scheme Runzheimer employed to price all allowance areas. Derived
from CES research, the number represented an average for the nation.



2.1.2.4&blank;Analysis of the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey



From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer used the statistical report entitled ``Table 2. Income before Taxes,'' which listed
average expenditures for families earning similar incomes, organized into eight income ranges. Runzheimer analyzed
these data to develop typical spending patterns for the three income profiles identified in 2.1.2.2. (The table below
displays the results of the analysis.)

Seven income categories encompassed these three income profiles:




$10,000 to $14,999
$15,000 to $19,999
$20,000 to $29,999
$30,000 to $39,999
$40,000 to $49,999
$50,000 and over
All respondents combined




The 1988 CES grouped expenses into small, logical families of items. For example, the report divided money spent by
families on beef into four groups: ground beef, roast, steak and other beef. The steak and roast groupings were further
separated into smaller clusters of items (e.g., sirloin and round steak, chuck and round roast).

Drawing on this survey of expenditure data, Runzheimer sorted the item groupings into the four main cost components
specified in the OPM regulations: Consumption Goods &amp; Services, Transportation, Housing, and Miscellaneous
Expenses. Runzheimer observed that families in the lower income ranges spent more of their money, as a percentage
of total expenses, on goods and services and housing than families in higher income ranges. Also, families spent approximately
the same percentage of their total expenses on transportation, regardless of income. Consequently, the Miscellaneous
Expense component_which includes such things as medical-care expenses, contributions, gifts to non-family members,
pension funds, long-term savings and investments, and life insurance premiums_increased as a percentage of total
expenses as income increased.

To develop accurate and defensible weighting patterns for the three income levels, Runzheimer performed linear
regression analysis on the selected 1988 CES data. Listed below are the results of Runzheimer's analysis for the income
ranges listed on the preceding page:



<TABLE>

Runzheimer further sorted Goods &amp; Services into ten categories and used linear regression techniques to provide
ratios of renters to homeowners at each income level. Statistics on these component groupings appear later in this
report.



2.2&blank;General Formulae and Applications



An ```index'' is a mathematical way to compare one price (or set of data) with another. For example, if a price index
for a can of green beans is 110, that means that a can of green beans costs 10% more in the pricing area (i.e., allowance
area) than in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area).

Runzheimer computed indexes for hundreds of items. To combine these indexes, Runzheimer applied weights from the
CES that reflected the relative amount consumers normally spend on the items. For example, the price of a can of green
beans has a lower weight than the price of a pound of apples because, according to the CES, people generally spend less
on canned green beans than on apples.

Runzheimer employed an indexing methodology known as Laspeyres to derive total cost indexes for each of three income
levels and for each costed location. As applied to living-cost research, the Laspeyres index reflects the expenditure
patterns of the people in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area) to weight the prices. Because detailed
CES data by income level are not published for the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer used nationwide CES data to compute
weights. Consequently, Runzheimer did not technically apply the Laspeyres index methodology in its pure form. Nevertheless,
Runzheimer firmly believes that this nuance does not invalidate the price comparisons presented in this report.

As described in the example above and in greater detail in sections 3.2 and 6.2, Runzheimer applied the Laspeyres methodology
to compute price indexes for the Goods &amp; Services and the Miscellaneous Expenses components, respectively.
For the Transportation and the Housing components, Runzheimer used a combination of a cost-build-up approach and
the Laspeyres methodology to compute component indexes.

In conformance with section 591.205(c), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Runzheimer followed a five-step process
to derive the overall total indexes for each allowance area. First, Runzheimer used the CES data and the income ranges
described in section 2.1.2.4 above to derive the amount of money consumers typically spend on each component at each
income level. These amounts appear in the table below and in Appendix 14.

Note: Values may not total because of rounding.

</TABLE>



Second, for each allowance area, Runzheimer multiplied the values above by the component indexes for the allowance
area. Because the Housing component consisted of two indexes (one for owners and another for renters), we produced
two sets of total relative costs_one for owners and another for renters.

Third, for each allowance area and income level, Runzheimer combined the total relative costs for owners and renters
using the proportion of owners and renters as identified in the CES to weight the costs. (See section 4.2.1) This produced
an overall, average, relative living cost at each income level in each allowance area.

Fourth, for each allowance area, the overall, average relative costs by income level were combined using federal
employment weights based on the employment at each income level in the allowance area. Applying the same allowance-area
employment weights, Runzheimer computed an overall, average cost for the reference area.

The last step was to divide the overall, average relative cost for the allowance area by the overall, average cost for
the reference area to produce the final index. (See Appendix 14 for the calculations for each index.)

2.3&blank;Data Collection Process 


As noted earlier, Runzheimer obtained price information on over 12,000 items from over 3,000 outlets. To accomplish
this important research effort, we selected the most efficient and effective information-gathering approaches
possible. This section describes the various approaches. 



2.3.1&blank;In-house Research Staff 


Runzheimer research personnel at its corporate headquarters in Rochester, Wisconsin, played a major role in all
data-collection activities. These professionals: 

&bull;Contacted manufacturers, trade associations, governmental agencies, and retail establishments to ensure
that suitable items were selected and priced; 

&bull;Contacted professionals in the real estate business in each of the costed locations to obtain general information
as well as specific rental rates and home market values; 

&bull;Conducted pricing surveys on site and by telephone for many items; 

&bull;Served as a liaison for field researchers; 

&bull;Performed hundreds of quality control checks in conformance with editing rules communicated by Runzheimer
to OPM once the data had been collected (these checks often involved verification of the survey data through telephone
calls as well as comparing current data-gathering results with those from the 1992-1993 survey); and 

&bull;Analyzed and computed the category, component and total comparative cost indexes. 



2.3.2&blank;Field Researchers_``Research Associates'' 



Collection of most price data was best accomplished through personal visits to retail outlets (e.g., grocery, clothing,
automobiles). For these activities, Runzheimer hired residents of each allowance area as independent contractors
(``research associates''). For years, when measuring living costs for its clients, Runzheimer has applied this
approach to data collection in over 80 countries worldwide. 

To avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest, Runzheimer did not hire persons as research associates who were
either employees of the federal government, or who had immediate family who were employees of the federal government.




2.3.3&blank;On-site Visits by Runzheimer Research Personnel 



Full-time Runzheimer research professionals travelled to selected allowance areas to supervise data-collection
activities and perform various quality-control checks on the data as necessary. Each such visit occurred during
the pricing period. 

The researchers visited living communities within the allowance areas to look at housing accommodations personally
and to talk with local real estate professionals. They also visited numerous retail outlets to verify item quality,
selection and price levels in general. 

In addition, these researches met with Runzheimer's research associate(s) to answer any data-collection questions
and to provide any additional training and instruction as necessary. 



2.4&blank;Editing and Quality Control Procedures 



Runzheimer's experience in measuring living-cost differences enabled us to establish editing and quality-control
procedures at all stages of collecting and analyzing data. All data provided by research associates were manually
reviewed by analysts prior to being entered into Runzheimer's computer system. Data elements were subsequently
checked through software programs. 

Federal regulations in section 591.205(b)(1)(i), title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, state that, ``Whenever
possible, exact brands and models are priced in each location.'' Every effort was made to satisfy this objective.
(See section 3.3 for a discussion of brand and model selection.) Nevertheless, in a number of the allowance areas,
the exact brands and models were either not readily available or not available at all. In these instances, editing
decisions and substitutions were needed. 

Runzheimer defines ``editing'' as the removal and/or replacement of a price quote based on consistent and logical
criteria. In all areas, Runzheimer was concerned that items of lesser or greater quality than the item specified might
inadvertently be included in the analysis and bias the results. Therefore, any price quote that varied significantly
from other price quotes for the item was flagged, verified, and if necessary, eliminated from the analysis. 

Removing an item from a location analysis causes redistribution of its weight to other items in its subcategory (or
category when no subcategory exists). Consequently, whenever possible, Runzheimer avoided removing an unpriced
item from a location analysis. When the review process revealed a missing price for an item, Runzheimer resurveyed
to obtain a price wherever possible. 



2.5&blank;Pricing Surveys in Hawaii County, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands 



Three allowances areas have multiple survey areas within each allowance areas. The three allowance areas are Hawaii
County, Hawaii; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For each of these areas, OPM provided Runzheimer GS employment
distribution data based on the moving-average approach described in section 2.1.1. 

In the Hawaii County allowance area, two areas are surveyed: Hilo and Kailua Kona. The OPM data indicated that approximately
82% of the GS employees worked in the Hilo area, and the remaining 18% worked in the Kailua Kona area. To combine prices
from both cities, Runzheimer used approximately an 82% Hilo and 18% Kailua Kona weighting. (See Appendix 13.) 

Similarly, in the Puerto Rico allowance area, two areas are surveyed: Mayaguez and San Juan. The OPM data indicated
that approximately 84% of the GS workforce in Puerto Rico work at facilities within or near the San Juan-Caguas-Areciro
Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. The remaining 16% is distributed throughout Puerto Rico without any
particular concentration. However, more of these remaining employees generally appeared to live closer to Mayaguez
than any other large Puerto Rican city. Therefore, with OPM's approval, Mayaguez was chosen for the survey. To combine
the prices from both cities, Runzheimer used approximately an 84% San Juan and 16% Mayaguez weighting. 

As noted earlier, this year OPM asked Runzheimer to combine survey data from St. Croix and St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
The same approach used in Hawaii County and Puerto Rico was applied to the Virgin Islands data. OPM's data indicated
that approximately 46% of the GS employees worked on St. Croix, and that the remaining 54% worked on St. Thomas and St.
John. Therefore, to combine the prices from these areas, Runzheimer used approximately a 46% St. Croix and 54% St.
Thomas/St. John weighting. 



2.6&blank;Surveying the Washington, DC, Area 



OPM defined the Washington, DC., area in the federal regulations as the Washington DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA Metropolitan
Statistical Area. Because federal employees who work in this area reside in Virginia, in Maryland, and in the District
of Columbia, Runzheimer selected retail outlets and living communities from all three. Runzheimer's model gave
equal weight to the average prices in each geographic area.

Because of the size and diversity of the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer conducted substantially more pricing
surveys there than in other areas. For the Goods &amp; Services component, Runzheimer generally surveyed to obtain
six times as many price quotes in the Washington, D.C., area as in the typical allowance area. For the Housing, Transportation
and Miscellaneous Expense components, data collection was generally triple that of the typical allowance area.


3. Consumption Goods &amp; Services


3.1&blank;Component Overview


Based on the CES data, the Goods &amp; Services component consisted of ten categories of family expense:



Food at Home
Food Away from Home
Tobacco
Alcohol
Furnishings &amp; Household Operations
Clothing
Domestic Services
Professional Services
Personal Care
Recreation



To aid in quality control and analysis of future pricings, Runzheimer further subdivided four of the largest categories_food
at home, furnishings and household operations, clothing, and recreation_into subcategories. Specific examples
of products and services from these four subdivided categories can be found below. These examples only represent
a minor portion of the total number of items (products and services) Runzheimer priced within each subdivided category.
(See Appendix 2 for a complete description of all marketbasket items.)

From its ten categories of expense (which include the four subdivided categories above), Runzheimer selected a marketbasket
of items on which to base its goods and services analysis. A ``marketbasket'' is a selected group of products and services
that represent hundred or even thousands of other items. Pricing every item available to consumers in a given locale
would be unnecessary and inefficient. 


Runzheimer selected typically purchased items and weighted these according to their relative importance in terms
of consumer expenditure patterns. Each marketbasket item represented a specific group of related expense items.
Using CES data, we determined the relative importance (weight) of each item. We compared the average price of each
marketbasket item in each allowance area with the average price in the Washington, D.C., area. The price differences
(expressed as indexes) were aggregated based on the item, subcategory and category weighting, resulting in a total
Goods &amp; Services component index at each income level. 


In 1991, OPM directed Runzheimer to include catalog pricing (including applicable shipping costs) to reflect this
common purchasing option in allowance areas. OPM identified items to survey based on comments received on the 1990
survey. Runzheimer identified items to survey that were either unavailable or difficult to find in each allowance
area. Together, OPM and Runzheimer agreed to survey five marketbasket items by catalog: For the 1992&hyph;1993 survey,
OPM asked Runzheimer to survey additional items by catalog; for example, furniture. For this year's survey, Runzheimer
has added additional catalog items. For the 1992&hyph;1993 survey, Runzheimer found that the cost to ship certain
catalog items to Guam varied between catalog outlets. With OPM's approval Runzheimer continued to price a private
freight company that specializes in shipments to Guam for shipping costs. 

In each survey area, Runzheimer generally requested three price quotes for each item (and sometimes more than three)
from the local economy_one from each of three different outlets. It should be remembered that Hawaii County, Hawaii;
Puerto Rico; and the Virgin Islands each have two separate survey areas. Therefore, Runzheimer generally doubled
the number of price quotes obtained in these allowance areas.

3.2.1&blank;Expenditure Research_Category Weightings 



Ruzheimer tabulated the expense data from the 1988 Consumer Expenditure Survey according to the ten categories of
goods and services. As in the component analysis, Runzheimer used the expense data from the seven most appropriate
income ranges as input into a linear regression analysis. From that analysis, Runzheimer calculated the category
weightings for each income level as listed belows:

3.2.2&blank;Expenditure Research_Subcategory and Item Weightings



Runzheimer also drew upon the expense data from the 1988 CES to determine proper subcategory and item weightings and
to identify marketbasket items. Logical groupings of family expenditures provided the basis for subcategory and
item weights. Unlike category weightings, which vary by income level, subcategory and item weightings are computed
from national aggregate expenditures only (i.e., all three income levels used the same set of subcategory and item
weightings) as this approach is most common in similar public and private sector cost-of-living analyses.

Runzheimer's expenditure research process included procedures to ensure that no marketbasket item had an overwhelmingly
large or insignificantly small item weighting.



3.3&blank;Marketbasket Item Specifications



From each logical expense grouping, Runzheimer selected one or more marketbasket items to represent all items in
the grouping. When selecting specific items for the marketbasket, Runzheimer worked to satisfy these three criteria:

&bull;Items should be readily available in all locations if possible or should be items of local significance.

&bull;Item price levels should logically represent the price levels of unselected items in the ``logical grouping.''

&bull;Items should have the same or nearly the same application in all locations.

Appendix 2 lists Runzheimer's marketbasket items. Once an item was selected, Runzheimer's research analysts identified
the specific brand and/or model/size of each item available in all (or most) locations. For some items, this involved
contacting manufacturers, trade associations, retail establishments, etc. For other items, isolating specifications
was quite straight forward because of their nature (e.g., bread, nonprescription pain reliever). Appendix 3 identifies
changes in the current items selected for pricing in the Goods &amp; Services, Miscellaneous Expense, and Housing
Related categories, along with explanation for the changes.



3.3.1&blank;Exchange and Commissary Expenditure Research



Runzheimer used the same marketbasket items to price commissaries and exchanges as were used for the local pricings.
We obtained one price quote for each marketbasket item surveyed in these facilities.

Runzheimer did not assume that people with access to military facilities made all purchases in these facilities.
Instead, we used OPM's 1980 Living Pattern Survey of federal employees to determine the percentage of purchases that
families typically make in military facilities versus local outlets. For example, as the following table shows,
in Honolulu, 52.7% of Food at Home is purchased at a PX or commissary. These percentages were used to aggregate the local
and commissary/exchange prices into one set of appropriate blended prices. (The blended prices were compared to
the local prices in the Washington, DC, areas just as each allowance area's local prices were.)

3.4&blank;Goods &amp; Services Data Collection Procedures 



3.4.1&blank;Data Collection Materials 



The living-cost surveys conform with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and are approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). 

Runzheimer collected data with OMB-approved data collection materials (see Appendix 5). All Runzheimer-developed
worksheets conformed to the OMB-approved materials. 



3.4.2&blank;Outlet Selection 



Proper outlet selection is crucial to measuring living-cost differences accurately because misjudgment can seriously
affect survey results. Runzheimer paid particular attention to choosing appropriate outlets, focusing on three
key guidelines to ensure proper outlet selection. 

First, for areas that had numerous outlets from which to choose, Runzheimer identified targets in several different
geographic areas. For example, in the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer selected outlets in and around six different
geographic areas: that is, two areas in Virginia, two in Maryland and two in the District of Columbia. 

Runzheimer's second guideline was that for any one marketbasket item, all outlets be similar in type. For example,
wherever possible, Runzheimer surveyed the prices of blue jeans at department stores, hammers at hardware stores,
and refrigerators at appliance stores. Gathering prices for the same item from hardware stores in one area and discount
stores in another could have distorted price comparisons. 

The last guideline involved the diversity of outlets in Runzheimer's sample. We believe that pricing different items
in different types of outlets more accurately portrays living-cost differences. For example, for efficiency, Runzheimer
could have priced all clothing items in department stores. However, to incorporate price levels at other types of
outlets that sell clothing items, whenever possible, Runzheimer surveyed some items in men's and women's clothing
stores, some items in department stores, other items in shoe stores and still other items in discount department stores.


Runzheimer's research analysts selected outlets on the basis of: 

&bull;Personal experience of Runzheimer on-site research associates and travelling researchers; 

&bull;Informal telephone interviews with knowledgeable residents in each area; 

&bull;Yellow pages sections of area telephone books; 

&bull;Area chambers of commerce and information bureaus; and 

&bull;Experience gained from other surveys conducted by Runzheimer. 

Runzheimer obtains outlets from various sources because no one source lists all outlets available. For example,
in the allowance areas especially, many outlets choose not to advertise in the yellow pages. 

With new businesses constantly appearing (and old ones disappearing), outlet selection will be an ongoing process.
Also, one can expect a portion of outlets to refuse to participate every year. Therefore, updating Runzheimer's outlet
sample is a necessary and important part of each pricing survey.

<TEXT>
 

An example of refining outlet selection for this year's survey is the attention paid to defining the distinguishing
differences between restaurants categorized as appropriate for family dining and those appropriate for fine dining.
OPM developed a matrix which defined such characteristics as menu selections, atmosphere, table setting, seating,
reservations, and AAA ratings. This allowed Runzheimer researchers to compare apples to apples between the allowance
areas and the Washington, D.C., area. Also, OPM established guidelines directing Runzheimer to survey 100% family
restaurants for breakfast, roughly 75% for lunch, and roughly 66% for dinner.




3.4.3&blank;Special Considerations in Guam and Kauai



The effects of Typhoon Omar and Hurricane Iniki in 1992 on the economies of Guam and Kauai, respectively, has been minimal
over the long term. At the time, Runzheimer officials worked with local research associates to determine the impact
of the storm on local prices.

This is not to say that the storms had no effect on the local economies. Indeed, prices in these two areas for the 1993&hyph;1994
survey have been re-examined carefully.

Of equal concern this year was the earthquake that rocked Guam during August, causing considerable damage and seriously
disrupting the flow of fresh produce into the island. For a period of about two weeks, all such produce had to be flown
in at considerably higher cost. Fortunately, when normal shipping channels reopened, ``normal'' pricing was quickly
restored, causing negligible affect on the Goods &amp; Services pricing. Also, a senior Runzheimer researcher from
the headquarters office traveled to Guam immediately following the earthquake to determine the full extent of the
impact on goods and services pricing.




3.5&blank;Inclusion of Sales and Excise Taxes



For all items subject to sales tax, the appropriate amount of tax was added prior to analysis. Runzheimer also included
all applicable sales, property and excise taxes to items that were part of other living-cost components. For example,
automobile purchase costs in Puerto Rico include an excise tax based upon vehicle type and dealer's acquisition cost.
Runzheimer included this tax in computing the total purchase price of a vehicle in Puerto Rico. (See sections 5.2.1
and 5.2.7.)

Runzheimer gathered applicable information on taxes by contacting appropriate sources of information in the allowance
areas, such as the Excise Tax Officer of the St. Thomas Bureau of Internal Revenue. Runzheimer also drew upon appropriate
tax publications, such as the State of Maryland's 

Sales and Use Tax Laws and Regulations 

and the ``General Excise Tax Law'' (Chapter 237) of the 

Hawaii Tax Reports.






3.6&blank;Goods &amp; Services Survey Results



In section 2.2 of this report, Runzheimer presented a detailed explanation of the economic model used to analyze the
price data. As it applies to Goods &amp; Services, the approach involved comparing the average prices of marketbasket
items in each allowance area with those in the Washington, D.C., area. The resulting price ratios were aggregated
into subcategory and then category indexes using the expenditure weightings derived from the 1988 CES.

In the area of professional services (accounting and legal fees), Runzheimer and OPM noted the existence of a relatively
few extreme values that were either exceptionally low or high cost. In situations such as this, statisticians frequently
use the median or trim the data in some manner to enhance reliability. Consequently, Runzheimer recommended that
the observations be ranked from low to high and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e.,
eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were four or fewer
observations.) OPM agreed. These procedures reduce the influence of anomalies and make survey results more stable
from one year to the next.

Appendix 4 contains tables showing the ten category indexes, the three weighting patterns, and the three total consumption
Goods &amp; Services indexes for each allowance area. The Washington, D.C., area does not require a table because
it is, by definition, ``the reference location'' where all category and component indexes equal 100.

4. Housing



4.1&blank;Component Overview



The Housing component consists of expenses related to owning or renting a dwelling. These include:

&bull;mortgage or rent payments,

&bull;utilities,

&bull;real estate taxes,

&bull;homeowner's or renter's insurance,

&bull;home maintenance, and

&bull;telephone.

At each of the three income levels, Runzheimer measured annual housing costs under the two main housing categories:
ownership and rental.



4.2&blank;Housing Model



4.2.1&blank;Expenditure Research



Section 2.1.2.4 describes how Runzheimer analyzed the 1988 CES to identify the portion of expenses attributable
to each of the four components. Runzheimer also used this survey to determine the national average ratio of families
who own, as opposed to rent, their residences. Using the expense data from the seven most appropriate income ranges
as input into a linear regression analysis, Runzheimer calculated own and rent weights:

Runzheimer excluded expenditure data for homeowning families without a mortgage because they were not typical of
homeowners in the base area or in the allowance areas with the largest concentrations of federal employees.
The 1988 CES was also used to identify which home-maintenance items to price and to establish the relative importance
of those items.


4.2.2&blank;Development of Housing Profiles


To compare housing costs accurately in all locations, Runzheimer constructed a model to measure housing costs under
six different circumstances; that is, we identified six typical housing profiles and matched these profiles to three
income levels, as shown in the table below. Runzheimer and OPM agreed that at least one criterion for the owner profile
should be the square footage of the home and at least one criterion for the renter profile should be the number of bedrooms
in the rental unit. The profiles for homeowners and renters are:


<TABLE>



Housing Profiles

1Defined as ``Total rooms_Bedrooms_Baths and representative size.'' Total rooms excludes bathrooms, hallways,
entrance areas, and closets but includes bedrooms, living room, family room, kitchen, formal dining room, and den/study.
The representative size is roughly the midpoint size for the range of housing surveyed at the income level.

2Row houses may be used in Northeast Washington, DC, where the availability of single family detached homes is limited.


</TABLE>




4.2.3&blank;Living Community Selection


Runzheimer surveyed the same living communities and data sources for the summer 1993 survey as it did for the 1992&hyph;1993
study with the following exceptions:

&bull;broadened the housing survey for St. Croix, Virgin Islands;
&bull;gathered comparable home-sale data from additional appraisers in selected points in Maryland;
&bull;arranged for additional data sources for comparable home sales at the upper income level in San Juan;
&bull;added a new on-line data source for comparable home-sale prices for all the islands of Hawaii.
To gather data, our researchers contacted real estate brokers, residential appraisers and other knowledgeable
real estate professionals in each area to obtain information on the predominant age(s), size(s) and type(s) of housing
in various communities and housing subdivisions. When available and appropriate, Runzheimer identified at least
six communities (two at each income level) in each allowance area. However, this goal was not achievable in some of
the smaller allowance areas. For the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer selected at least nine communities (three
at each income level) in which to gather renter and homeowner data.
A table of living communities used for pricing can be found in Appendix 6.


4.2.4&blank;Identification and Quantification of Housing-Related Expenses


From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer identified and categorized housing-related expense items into one of five groups:
&bull;utilities,
&bull;real estate taxes,
&bull;owners/renters insurance,
&bull;maintenance, and
&bull;telephone.


4.2.4.1&blank;Utilities


For this study, Runzheimer classified electric, heat (oil or gas), water and sewer as utilities. Although most utility
companies had ready access to current charges per unit of consumption and average consumption patterns for all households,
very few (if any) separated consumption patterns by number of family members in a household or by size/type of accommodation.
Runzheimer focused on average annual consumption experience per household, gathering this information from utility
companies serving each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area. Combining this consumption data with current
utility rates, Runzheimer computed average annual utility costs for each of electric, gas or oil (whichever Runzheimer
found to be more widely used, if used at all), water and sewer. Runzheimer then assigned this average consumption pattern
to the homeowner profile at the middle income level.
Because some utility costs vary by size of house and yard, Runzheimer calculated a multiplier consistent with the
standard home sizes to arrive at utility rates for the other five profiles. The table below shows the standard sizes
and utility factors for each profile. The standard sizes roughly equate to the reference size of each profile. The
formula to calculate each multiplier was:
Multiplier = 1+(.5 &times; (Standard square feet_1300)/1300)
The resulting utility multipliers are:

4.2.4.2&blank;Real Estate Taxes


For this study, Runzheimer contacted the city assessor in each allowance area to obtain real estate tax information
on the selected living communities. (See Appendix 6 for a listing of the communities.) Real estate tax formulas were
obtained for most living communities; however, Runzheimer's researchers found that in San Juan, PR, the formulas
do not always translate into the actual taxes paid by typical property owners.
Therefore, in San Juan, Runzheimer undertook a comparative study of current actual taxes paid by homeowners and their
current home values. Runzheimer then developed an average ratio for taxes paid to current home values. This ratio
was applied to the average home value in that community to obtain an average real estate tax amount for the desired homeowner
profile.

4.2.4.3&blank;Owners/Renters Insurance


As it did for previous surveys, Runzheimer undertook to gather insurance-rate information for the allowance areas
for both renter and owner profiles. These rates represent coverage for structure and contents for homeowners but
contents only for renters.
Previous research conducted by Runzheimer, at the request of OPM, found that insurance coverage for disasters, such
as floods and earthquakes, is not commonly purchased by allowance area residents. Consequently, Runzheimer, with
the concurrence of OPM, does not consider these additional riders. (See 

Report to OPM on Living Costs in Selected NonForeign Areas and in the Washington-D.C., Area,

 June 1992 at 57 FR 58556). Runzheimer notes, however, that OPM is reviewing the results of the Federal Employee Housing
and Living Patterns Survey as they apply to this issue.


4.2.4.4&blank;Maintenance


Many factors were involved in measuring the cost of maintaining a home, including area climate, architecture and
building materials, and the cost of maintenance materials and labor. As it did for the previous survey, Runzheimer
priced such household maintenance commodities as fire extinguisher, bathroom caulking and kitchen faucet. Pest
control service was priced in each allowance area surveyed.
Runzheimer developed maintenance costs based on the cost of maintenance materials and labor rates in each area. Runzheimer's
approach to maintenance was the same as the approach to goods and services, as explained below.
Runzheimer used expenditure data from the 1988 CES to identify the national average home-maintenance expense, the
maintenance items to survey, and the appropriate item weighting. Because most, if not all, maintenance items were
included in rent, maintenance costs were not added in the three renter profiles.
To compute home-maintenance cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, DC, area for the homeowner
profiles, Runzheimer obtained prices for selected building materials and labor rates for maintenance work. For
each area, Runzheimer computed the relative cost (i.e., an index) for each maintenance item compared to the cost of
that item in the DC area. As with Goods &amp; Services, the results of the nationwide CES were used to weight these maintenance
indexes into an overall index for each area.
To combine maintenance indexes with the other homeowner costs, which were expressed in dollar amounts, Runzheimer
converted the indexes to dollars. To do this, Runzheimer multiplied the maintenance cost index for each area by the
CES nationwide average maintenance cost and assigned that cost to the middle-income homeowner profile.
Logically, maintenance costs for larger homes would be greater than costs for middle-sized homes, while costs for
smaller homes would be less. Therefore, in this study, Runzheimer applied the same homeowner multipliers used in
the utilities model for the lower and upper income profiles (.85 and 1.15 respectively) to recognize differences
in maintenance costs due to house size.


4.2.4.5&blank;Telephone


Telephone expenses consisted of local service charges, possible additional charges for local calls, and charges
for long distance calls. To measure estimated expenses for local service and local calls, where available, Runzheimer
surveyed the cost of touch-tone service with unlimited calling.
To estimate long distance charges in all areas, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of three ten-minute direct dial calls
per month to large U.S. mainland cities (i.e., Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City). Runzheimer measured the price
of a call placed in the survey area at the time of day necessary to be received in the respective city at 8:00 p.m. local
time. In many areas, this resulted in pricing a combination of daytime and evening-rate calls.


4.3&blank;Housing Data Collection Procedures


As was done in previous years, Runzheimer collected housing information from a variety of sources. Also as in previous
years, Runzheimer research personnel traveled to profiled communities in the allowance areas to observe first hand
the comparability of homes in one area versus another and the appropriateness of individual housing units for the
profiled income level.
Last year, OPM modified the contract to require several additional steps to increase the quantity and quality of housing
data collected. These extra steps were incorporated again this year and included purchasing data from additional
real estate listing services, making greater use of assessor's records when other data were not available, and contacting
more real estate professionals to obtain additional home sales, rental data, and market trend information.

4.3.1&blank;Homeowner Data Collection



In the homeowner data-gathering phase, Runzheimer obtained sale prices of homes (called ``comparable sales'')
in the area that matched the housing profiles. In the communities that were identified (see section 4.2.3), Runzheimer
tried to obtain all the comparable sales during the 6-month period prior to the date of the survey. For the surveys covered
in this report, the home sales pricing period was January 1993 through July 1993.

As was done last year, Runzheimer contacted knowledgeable and helpful real estate professionals in each location
and/or used real estate sales data and listing services. The amount of data obtained depended on the number of home
sales in the community and the availability of square footage and other information. This in turn depended on the size
of the community, the economic conditions, the quality and quantity of the realty data available, and the willingness
and ability of local realty professionals and assessor offices to provide data. If the comparable sales data obtained
from the first data sources were insufficient, Runzheimer contacted additional data sources in the area to attempt
to secure more sales data, if practical.



4.3.2&blank;Renter Data Collection



In some cases, the same Realtors and brokers who assisted in our profiling phase were very active in the rental markets
as well. When this occurred, Runzheimer obtained current rental rates and fees for our profiled apartments, townhouses,
and houses from these sources.

Runzheimer also contacted rental management firms that operate apartment complexes matching the profile specifications.
In large metropolitan areas, such as the Washington, D.C., area where rental complexes abound, our housing analysts
conducted telephone surveys to obtain current rental information.

OPM modified the contract last year to expand the level of effort that Runzheimer expended in the collection of housing
data. The result both last year and this year was a marked increase in the quantity of housing data collected for both
rentals and sales.

Rental data were obtained from a variety of sources, e.g., brokers, property managers, newspaper advertisements,
and others. Analyses of these data indicated that there are two separate rental markets_a broker market and a non-broker
market. Rental rates and estimates provided by brokers generally exceed those obtained from other sources.

In each area, the quantity of data obtained from either source-type varies significantly. Therefore, analyzing
all of the rental data (both broker and non-broker) together for an area and income level is undesirable. Because OPM
has no information on how federal employees who rent generally secure their lodgings, Runzheimer applied equal weights
to the broker and non-broker data to compute the overall average rental rate for the area and income level. (See Appendix
9B.)



4.4&blank;Housing Analysis



4.4.1&blank;Homeowner Data Analysis



One of the most important factors relating to the price of a home is the number of square feet of living space. For each
income profile in each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer computed that average price per
square foot for the comparables. Except as noted below, Runzheimer used this value times the reference square footage
for the profile to determine the average home value for the profile.

Runzheimer experienced difficulties in obtaining housing data in some areas. For example, despite several efforts
to obtain more detailed information from various sources, Runzheimer was able to obtain very few comparable sales
with square footage information for home sales in Mayaguez. Also, as noted earlier in this report, OPM elected to combine
the St. Croix and St Thomas data to address concerns about the number of home-sale observations obtained in the Virgin
Islands.



4.4.1.1&blank;Data Trimming



Based on experience from the previous home-pricing surveys, last year OPM modified the living-cost model as it applied
to the analysis of housing data. The modifications allowed the use of housing costs trend data as well as current housing
costs in the analysis of owner and renter living costs. These analyses are consistent with section 591.205(b)(3)
of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and result in improved housing data results.

One of the modifications involves ``trimming'' the observations. Runzheimer and OPM noted that a relatively few
extreme values (values that were either exceptionally low or high cost) could have a significant influence on the
average housing costs observed at an income level within an area. Including these extreme values had the potential
to cause results to vary erratically from one year to the next.

In situations such as this, statisticians frequently use the median or trim the data in some manner to reduce its volatility.
The use of the median home value was not desirable because some areas had relatively sparse data at one or more income
levels. This could make the median unstable from one year to the next.

Last year Runzheimer recommended, and OPM agreed, that the observations be ranked from low to high on the basis of the
cost per square foot and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e., eliminated) from the
data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were four or fewer observations.)
These procedures reduce the influence of home sales anomalies and make survey results more stable from one year to
the next.



4.4.1.2&blank;Special Considerations



The new procedures also involved analyzing data in a more thorough and integrated manner. The procedures required
analyzing the current housing survey data, analyzing the trends observed when these data were compared with the previous
survey's data, and comparing these trends with the views obtained from real estate professionals in the area. How
and which data were used depended on the quality and quantity of data collected and how the trends observed agreed among
income levels and with the views of local real estate professionals. These procedures are discussed below.

Runzheimer sought to gather all of the appropriate comparable sales data available in each area. As a minimum, Runzheimer
sought to obtain 10 Realtor sales per community per income level or 20 per income level per area. In many areas, the sales
data exceeded the minimum.

If the minimum number could not be obtained or if highly divergent trend data were observed among income levels in the
area or as compared with the views of local real estate professionals, additional analyses were performed. These
analyses were:

1. If the current data were significantly better than the previous data (e.g., greater in quantity or more consistent),
the current data were used to the extent practical.

2. If at least three observations at each income level were available, and the previous data were better than the current
data or the previous and current data were of equivalent quality, the change (i.e., trend) in the average price was
used to update the previous data. This was done using one of the following procedures, depending on the situation:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940526-2-00109 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940526-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. If data problems occurred at one income level only, the average rate of change at the other two income levels was used
to adjust the previous prices for the affected income level.

b. If data problems occurred in two income levels, the rate of change observed at the non-problem income level was used
to adjust the previous prices for the two affected income levels.

c. If data problems occurred at all income levels, the average rate of change observed at all three income levels was
used to adjust the previous prices at all income levels.

3. If fewer than three observations were available at any income and/or the data quality was questionable at all levels,
all three levels of current and previous survey data were merged. These data were then analyzed by applying the procedures
described in section 4.4.1.1 above to each set of merged data, and the average cost per square foot was computed for
each set of data and compared to estimate the overall change in the area. This overall change was applied to the previous
average costs by income level to determine the current costs at each income level for the area.

The areas for which these procedures were applied and the calculations used are found in Appendix 9A.



4.4.2&blank;Rental Data Analysis



Runzheimer assigned each rental quote data point to a single income level, based on these criteria:

&bull;Assign one bedroom apartments to the lower income level.
&bull;Assign two bedroom apartments to the middle income level.
&bull;Assign townhouses and detached houses with a minimum of two bedrooms to the upper income level.



4.4.2.1&blank;Data Trimming and Special Analyses



In the analysis of rental data, Runzheimer applied the same procedures used to trim the home sales data (see section
4.4.1.1) except that data were ranked on the basis of monthly rental rates, not cost per square foot. Also, as with home
sales analyses, special analyses were applied to rental data when the data where sparse or highly divergent trends
were observed among income levels. These analyses were the same as those applied to home sales data (see section 4.4.1.2)
except that if data were merged, overall estimates were based on monthly rental rates, not the cost per square foot.
(See Appendix 9B for these analyses.)



4.4.3&blank;Analysis of Housing-Related Expenses



Because section 4.2.4 covers the identification and quantification of housing-related expenses, these topics
are not repeated here.

However, it should be noted that Runzheimer incorporated home sale prices from this study into the calculations of
real estate taxes and homeowner's insurance, which depend upon the value of the home.



4.5&blank;Housing Survey Results



In the above sections, Runzheimer describes how it measured the costs for maintenance, insurance, utilities, real
estate taxes, rents, and homeowner mortgages. Appendix 7 shows the cost of each of these items, for renters and homeowners
separately, in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area. For Hawaii County, Hawaii; Puerto Rico; and
the Virgin Islands, these costs are shown separately for each of the survey areas within the allowance area.

Appendix 8 compares the total cost of these items in each allowance area with the total cost of the same items in the Washington,
D.C., area. Again, there are separate comparisons for renters and homeowners.

The final housing-cost comparisons take the form of indexes that are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total, overall
index for owners and renters. (Refer to section 2.2 for a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes
are combined.)

5. Transportation


5.1&blank;Component Overview


The Transportation component consisted of expenses related to private and public transportation. The private transportation
category contained expenses related to owning and operating a vehicle in each area. The public transportation category
focused on the cost of air fares from each location to a common point within the contiguous 48 states.
As in previous surveys, Runzheimer used national average expenditure data to combine the private and public transportation
relative cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area to arrive at a total Transportation
component index.


5.2&blank;Private Transportation Methodology


Runzheimer determined that an accurate and reasonable approach to measure transportation costs was to select and
analyze three commonly driven vehicles (a domestic auto, an import auto and a utility vehicle) in all areas.
New vehicles were the basis for developing the transportation-cost calculations. Although Runzheimer could have
developed costs from the premise that ``identical'' used vehicle would be purchased from auto dealers in each location,
Runzheimer believed that costing new vehicles reduced the potential for inconsistencies due to value judgments
concerning used vehicles.


5.2.1&blank;Vehicle Selection and Pricing


As mentioned above, Runzheimer selected and priced a domestic auto, an import auto, and a utility vehicle as the basic
vehicle types to cost in all locations. We based our selection of these vehicle types on their popularity in the United
States as demonstrated by owner registration data.
To select a specific make and model within each vehicle type, Runzheimer identified the top-selling models in each
car class. For these models, Runzheimer's research associates collected new vehicle prices.
At each auto dealership in the sample, Runzheimer recorded the suggested retail prices of the three vehicles plus
any additional charges, such as shipping, excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. Runzheimer used
the suggested retail prices (not negotiated prices) in the analysis. Runzheimer also included documentation fees
as part of the new-vehicle costs in Hawaii. Contacted dealerships explain that a documentation fee is charged on a
new-car purchase to cover paperwork costs. Runzheimer did not include a fee for the Washington, D.C., area and other
tropical areas because dealers in those areas do not typically charge a documentation fee.
The three vehicles selected for analysis were:



Domestic Vehicle_Ford Taurus GL 4-door sedan 3.0L 6cyl
Utility Vehicle_Chevrolet S10 Blazer 4X4 2 door 4.3L 6 cyl
Import Vehicle_Honda Civic DX 4-door sedan 1.5L 4 cyl



Runzheimer priced 1993 models in this survey. All vehicles were equipped with standard options, such as automatic
transmission, AM/FM stereo radio and air conditioning.
Car dealers in the Washington, D.C., area do not recommend vehicle rustproofing. However, it is suggested or recommended
in allowance areas. Therefore, we include rustproofing as an add-on in all allowance areas, but not in the Washington,
D.C., area.


5.2.2&blank;Vehicle Trade Cycle


Calculating the cost to own and operate a vehicle requires that two important factors be determined: miles driven
and time period of ownership. In the automobile industry, these two factors are known collectively as a vehicle's
``trade cycle.'' The trade cycle is stated as a length of time either in months or years, and the total number of miles
driven in that time period (e.g., four-year, 60,000-mile trade cycle). This information is required to compute annual
costs related to fuel, oil, tires, maintenance and depreciation.
Conforming with previous living-cost reports, Runzheimer used a four-year 60,000-mile trade cycle in all areas
based upon the following information:
&bull;The Internal Revenue Service has used this trade cycle for many years to compute the allowable cents-per-mile
reimbursement rate for persons who drive their personal vehicle for business purposes.
&bull;The four-year time period coincides with the typical length of a vehicle loan.
&bull;U.S. Department of Energy statistics for 1988 show that the U.S. average for number of vehicles miles driven
was: 18,595 per household and 10,246 miles per vehicle.
Runzheimer has been unable to find conclusive statistics on average annual miles driven per vehicle in any allowance
area. In the past, Runzheimer contacted car dealers to obtain their observations on average odometer mileage on trade-in
vehicles.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940526-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940526-2-00063 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

From the opinions gathered, we concluded that, in most cases, the average annual miles driven in allowance locations
appeared to be less than or equal to 15,000. In the Washington, D.C., area, the opinions of those contacted indicated
an average annual mileage of 15,000 or more. Therefore, without definitive statistics to prove otherwise, Runzheimer
set a standard used in all reports to date of 15,000 miles per year, which results in a four-year, 60,000-mile trade
cycle.



5.2.3&blank;Fuel Performance and Type



To establish average fuel-performance ratings, Runzheimer selected the ``city driving'' figures published by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Runzheimer chose the ``city'' instead of ``highway'' figures because
all locations contained considerable stop-and-go driving conditions. All vehicles included in this study used
regular unleaded fuel. Runzheimer obtained self-service cash prices at branded stations only, and substituted
full-service when self-service was not available or only non-branded stations were available.

As in its second report to OPM, Runzheimer has included in its analysis a number of fuel-performance factors; specifically,
temperature, road surface, and gradient. Based on our research of these three factors, Runzheimer analysts developed
fuel-performance adjustment percentages in each allowance area.



5.2.3.1&blank;Impact of Temperature upon Fuel Performance



Runzheimer consulted two published sources to develop its adjustment percentages for this fuel-efficiency factor:


Passenger Car Fuel Economy: EPA and Road

 and 

The Weather Almanac

 (Ruffner &amp; Blair). Miles-per-gallon performance varies by ambient temperature. The lower the temperature,
the fewer miles-per-gallon achieved and vice versa. In the EPA study, the temperature at which no adjustments to fuel
performance occur is 77
&cir; F. Below that temperature, miles-per-gallon achieved drops; above 77
&cir;, miles-per-gallon achieved improves. To measure the effect temperature has on miles-per-gallon for each
allowance area, Runzheimer research average monthly temperatures as reported in 

The Weather Almanac.



In each location and for each month, Runzheimer assigned the appropriate shortfall factor from the EPA study based
on the average monthly temperature for each given location. After assigning factors to each month, Runzheimer averaged
the twelve factors for each location. The results of these calculations are shown in section 5.2.3.4.

5.2.3.2&blank;Impact of Road Surface upon Fuel Performance



For its analysis, Runzheimer assumed that federally controlled roadways are typically composed of concrete and/or
high-load asphalt and that locally controlled roadways are typically composed of low-load asphalt. EPA's research
indicates that cars are generally more fuel-efficient on the firmer, high-load surfaces than on the softer, low-load
surfaces.

Although traffic patterns and road usage certainly vary among areas, Runzheimer could find no relevant studies of
these issues. Therefore, Runzheimer assumed that federally controlled roadways generally support twice the traffic
of or are used at least twice as much as locally controlled roadways.

In each allowance area, Runzheimer researched the total mileage falling into either the federal or local categories.
For example, Hawaii contains 1,456 miles of federally controlled roads and 2,606 miles of locally controlled roads.
The usage assumption allowed Runzheimer to increase federal road mileage by a factor of two.

Runzheimer applied the average low-load asphalt factor (which reflects dry, wet, and snowy conditions) to the local
mileage percentage and the average concrete and/or high-load asphalt factor to the federal mileage percentage to
create a weighted average factor for each area. The weighted factor for the allowance areas surveyed was 0.98. The
Washington, D.C., area was assigned a factor of 1.00 on the premise that the vast majority of traffic in that area travels
on dry, high-load surfaces. (See section 5.2.3.4 for application of this factor in estimating overall MPG.)



5.2.3.3&blank;Impact of Gradient upon Fuel Performance



Runzheimer consulted EPA's 

Passenger Car Fuel Economy: EPA and Road

 to determine the effect of local topography (i.e. gradient) upon fuel efficiency. EPA provides mileage factors based
upon various gradients ranging from less than 0.5% (essentially flat) to greater than 6% (steep).

Runzheimer reviewed the topographic features of each area and found a wide range of road conditions. However, Runzheimer
was unable to find information on the types of terrain drivers typically encounter in each area or the number of miles
drivers travel in each type of terrain.

Lacking such information, Runzheimer assumed that drivers in the allowance areas generally travel roads having
approximately the same gradients that are found on average in the United States. Applying the information from EPA's
research, Runzheimer computed a fuel-performance factor of 0.981 for this type of driving. This factor was assigned
to each allowance area. Runzheimer assigned a factor of 1.00 to the Washington, D.C., area on the premise that the vast
majority of traffic in that area travels on major freeways and highways that are relatively flat. (See section 5.2.3.4
for application of this factor in estimating overall fuel efficiency.)



5.2.3.4&blank;Overall Impact upon Fuel Performance



Runzheimer applied the results of the analyses described above to ``localize'' or make geographically sensitive
adjustments to the EPA average ratings and establish reasonable fuel-performance ratings for each allowance area.

In the table below, the factor 1.00 means that no adjustment to EPA fuel performance is appropriate. A factor of less
than 1.00 means that the estimated gasoline mileage in the area is less than the EPA average. For example, the total
adjustment factor for Guam is 0.95. This means that the estimated gasoline mileage in Guam is 95% of the EPA estimated
average. Note that the adjustment factor for the Washington, D.C., area (0.94) indicates that average gasoline mileage
in that area is below the EPA estimate also.

5.2.4&blank;Vehicle Maintenance



With OPM's concurrence, Runzheimer selected the five most common maintenance service/repair jobs performed on
vehicles as the basis for vehicle maintenance analysis:

&bull;tune-up,

&bull;oil change,

&bull;automatic transmission fluid change,

&bull;flush/fill coolant, and

&bull;muffler installation.

Automobile manufacturers' recommended maintenance schedules were used to determine the frequency of performing
each of these maintenance jobs. Maintenance schedules vary, depending on the driving conditions typically encountered.
Consistent with the assumptions used for fuel economy and tire mileage, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions
in the allowance areas were generally severe and used the maintenance schedules that reflected that kind of driving.
For the D.C. area, Runzheimer assumed that driving conditions were normal and used the maintenance schedules that
reflected that kind of driving.

The recommended frequency of performing each of these jobs was combined with the prices charged by local dealers and
service stations to compute an estimated annual maintenance expense.

For this year's survey, Runzheimer collected specific parts costs and hourly labor costs in each location, three
prices per item, per location. Runzheimer used Chilton's Labor Guide and Parts Manual to determine service times
for each maintenance procedure, and used only one service time per maintenance procedure. This will result in more
uniform prices within each location.



5.2.5&blank;Tires



Research previously conducted by Runzheimer for OPM (see the June 1992 report) revealed that various factors (e.g.,
road quality/state of repair, road composition) caused tread life (the average number of miles a tire is expected
to last) to be less in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C. area. Based on these findings, Runzheimer based
tire expenses on a 40,000-mile tread-life in allowance areas, and a 55,000-mile tread-life in the Washington, D.C.,
area.



5.2.6&blank;License and Registration Fees, and Miscellaneous Tax



Runzheimer obtained information regarding appropriate license and registration fees, and miscellaneous taxes
(i.e., personal property tax and motor vehicle registration tax) from each area. One-time fees and miscellaneous
taxes were divided equally over each vehicle's four-year trade cycle. Sales and excise taxes were included in the
purchase price of each vehicle (see section 5.2.7.). Ongoing fees and taxes were included as part of the annual costs.



5.2.7&blank;Depreciation



From Runzheimer's experience, the single largest annual expense related to owning and operating newer vehicles
is vehicle depreciation, the lost value of the vehicle as it ages and is driven. To calculate average annual depreciation,
Runzheimer divides the difference between the purchase price and the residual value by the number of years the vehicle
is owned.

In the depreciation equation, Runzheimer used suggested retail prices, plus any additional charges, such as shipping,
excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. (Runzheimer did not believe that negotiated prices could
be collected on an equitable basis.) As discussed earlier, the trade cycle was determined to be four years, 60,000
miles. Runzheimer research indicated that residual values were the same in all areas. This research effort is explained
below.

Runzheimer is aware that several firms and associations track and publish weekly or monthly used-car and used-truck
wholesale auction prices. Some firms even publish projections of the future value of today's new vehicles. Most publications
provide several residual values for each vehicle, depending on its condition at the time of trade-in (e.g., clean,
average, rough). Several common publications of this type are 

Black Book, Kelley Blue Book, Automotive Market Report, 

and 

NADA 

National Automobile Dealers Association). Unfortunately, these sources only track prices for vehicles sold in
the contiguous 48 states and then publish broad-based average residual values for each vehicle.

To get specific information from sources knowledgeable about the used vehicle markets in allowance areas, Runzheimer
contacted auto dealers and financial institutions in these areas. Most of the sources with whom Runzheimer spoke
said that they used the above-mentioned publications as guides, just as dealers and financial institutions across
the United States used them.

Runzheimer found no conclusive evidence that used vehicles in allowance areas were (on average) worth more or less
than used vehicles in the Washington, D.C., area. Therefore, we reported the same used vehicle prices in all areas.
An appropriate and logical source for these values was the April 1993 issue of 

Black Book Official Finance/Lease Guide 

for 1993 vehicles.

It should be noted for clarification that identical residual values did not translate into identical depreciation
amounts in all locations. Depreciation amounts were higher in allowance areas than in the Washington, D.C., area
because new vehicle prices in all allowance areas were higher. For example, new vehicle prices in Puerto Rico averaged
50% more than Washington, D.C., prices.



5.2.8&blank;Finance Expense



Runzheimer included the average annual cost of financing a vehicle in the total cost of private transportation. Runzheimer
surveyed automobile dealerships in Puerto Rico and banks in all other areas for their auto-loan interest rates, using
a 48-month loan length with 80% financing as the basis in all locations.



5.2.9&blank;Vehicle Insurance



Runzheimer measured the cost of auto insurance in each location. To determine the type of coverage to price, Runzheimer
contacted insurance agents in each area to obtain information on the typical policy. Listed below are the most common
coverages, limits, and deductibles for the surveyed living-cost areas.




Bodily Injury_$100,000/$300,000

Property Damage_$50,000

Medical_$5,000

Uninsured Motorist_$100,000/$300,000

Comprehensive_$100 Deductible

Collision_$250 Deductible




Runzheimer found that insurance companies in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands provide slightly different
limits and deductibles than those listed above; therefore, Runzheimer and OPM agreed to incorporate the premiums
associated with these different limits and deductibles into the indexes.

To do this, Runzheimer surveyed in the D.C. area the price of insurance policies that were equivalent to the policy
offered in the allowance area. From this comparison, Runzheimer computed an index that was applied to the price of
the typical policy surveyed in the Washington, DC, area. By applying this factor to the average price in the D.C. area,
Runzheimer was able to estimate the cost of equivalent coverage in the allowance area. (See Appendix 10B.)

<TEXT>
 

In all areas, Runzheimer attempted to identify the most ``popular'' automobile insurance companies by analyzing
market-share reports compiled by an industry rating bureau. The policy described above was then priced again this
year for each location. Two or three price quotes were obtained for each area, totalled for each area, and averaged
together to produce the final number for this component in each allowance area.


5.3&blank;Public Transportation Methodology


As was done last year, Runzheimer surveyed the cost of air fares as they relate to recreational travel. Runzheimer
priced the lowest available round-trip air fare from each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles,
California. Los Angeles was selected because it is a common point approximately equidistant from most of the allowance
areas and the Washington, D.C., area. The cost of the trip from each allowance area to Los Angeles was compared with
the cost of the trip from the Washington, D.C., area to Los Angeles to compute the public transportation category indexes.
(See Appendix 11.)


5.4&blank;Transportation Survey Results


Runzheimer measured the costs for fuel, maintenance and oil, tires, licensing, taxes, depreciation, finance, and
insurance for three types of automobiles in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area to determine typical
private transportation costs. Appendix 10A shows the cost of each of these items in each area. As with the housing costs,
private transportation costs for Hawaii County, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, are shown separately for each
of the survey areas within these allowance areas. These data are combined to produce composite costs for each allowance
area using the respective federal employment distributions. (See sections 2.5 and 2.6 for a discussion of employment
weighting in these two areas.)
Appendix 11 compares the total cost of the private transportation items for each vehicle in each allowance area with
the total cost of the same items in the Washington, D.C., area. Appendix 11 also shows how the private and public transportation
indexes were combined using expenditure weights derived from the CES data to produce final transportation indexes.
The final transportation indexes are used in Appendix 14 to derive the total overall index. (Refer to section 2.2 for
a discussion of the general formulae and how the component indexes are combined.)


6. Miscellaneous Expenses


6.1&blank;Component Overview


The Miscellaneous Expense component consists primarily of four unrelated groups of expenses:
&bull;Medical care,
&bull;Contributions (including gifts to non-family members),
&bull;Personal insurance, and
&bull;Savings and investments (including pensions).
Runzheimer believes that certain miscellaneous expense items should not affect living-cost differences between
locations. For example, Runzheimer considers charitable contributions a personal choice, so we include this expenditure
as a constant amount in all locations. Based on research into all of the expenses of this component, Runzheimer also
regards expenses related to personal insurance, savings and investments, and pensions as constants, for reasons
discussed in section 6.2.2.
To measure the miscellaneous expenses, Runzheimer constructed a pricing methodology similar to the one used in the
Goods &amp; Services component. Runzheimer selected representative items for medical care, priced them in all areas,
and then computed a Miscellaneous Expense component index based on the relative importance of costed items/categories
held constant.


6.2&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Model
6.2.1&blank;Expenditure Research


From the 1988 CES, Runzheimer tabulated the miscellaneous expense data into logical expense groupings and then determined
the appropriate item weighting. The table on the following page lists the categories that Runzheimer selected to
price and their weights:

6.2.2&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Methodology



As stated in section 2.2, Runzheimer used the Laspeyres indexing methodology to compute the Miscellaneous Expense
component index. For groups of items held constant, the model assumed a price ratio between the allowance area and
the Washington, D.C., area equal to 100.00%.

Runzheimer defined personal insurance and pensions as the portion of a family's budget that was targeted for long-term
financial security. This is consistent with the definitions used by the CES, the results of which are used as weights
in the COLA model. In the CES, money stored in a savings account or investment vehicle for future expenditures (of goods
and services, housing, or transportation) is accounted for in the other component weightings.

In section 6.1, we noted that expenses related to personal insurance were held constant for all locations. This was
based on information received from life insurance companies and OPM officials. The life insurance companies contacted
indicated that policies written (and premiums charged) to persons within the United States and its territories did
not vary due to location. Runzheimer's research and discussions with OPM officials also indicated that, in general,
federal employees in all areas received similar or identical benefits packages_variations are generally due to
personal preference. Therefore, Runzheimer believed, and OPM concurred, that holding these types of expenses constant
was appropriate.

6.3&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Data Collection Procedures


Medical care items were surveyed consistent with the approach used in the Goods &amp; Services component. For quality-control
purposes, Runzheimer used its in-house research staff to conduct much of this survey.
The following medical-care items were priced in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area:
&bull;Nonprescription pain reliever.
&bull;Prescription drugs.
&bull;Vision check.
&bull;Dental service.
&bull;Doctor visit.
&bull;Hospital room.
&bull;Health insurance.
Runzheimer computed a Medical Care subcategory price index for each item in each allowance area by comparing each
local average price with the Washington, D.C., area average prices. These indexes were combined using weights derived
from the CES to compute a Medical Care subcategory index for each allowance area.


6.4&blank;Miscellaneous Expense Survey Results


Appendix 12 contains the results of Runzheimer's data collection and index calculations. As the appendix shows,
the relative costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore,
the Miscellaneous Component index reflects living-cost differences among areas. The cost of only two items_life
insurance/pensions and contributions_does not differ among areas. Although these two items together have a significant
weight, one should keep in mind that the Miscellaneous Component has the smallest weight of the four components.
Section 2.2 describes how the Miscellaneous Expense component indexes are combined with the other component indexes
to derive the final index for each area.

7.2&blank;General Comments 



Runzheimer's primary goal throughout its work on each study has been to bring fairness and accuracy to the results.
The scope of this multi-year engagement has become more comprehensive by virtue of special research projects, seasonal
pricings, expanded marketbasket pricings and other efforts. Runzheimer believes that living-cost research is
a dynamic process, not a static one, and that fresh research and analysis will enhance further the quality of the survey
and the findings. Moreover, we believe that planned, ongoing interaction with OPM will aid the process and improve
accuracy. 



7.3&blank;Recommendations 



As noted earlier in this report, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes in the living-cost
surveys and analyses. We believe that the research will show that income taxes represent a significant portion of
living expenses_a portion that varies from one area to the next. 

As also noted in the report, Runzheimer recognizes that it applied the same salary levels and CES data this year as it
did in the 1990 surveys. We commend OPM for introducing new Federal employment weights and urge OPM to continue with
its plans to introduce gradually new CES data and salary levels in future surveys.

Nonforeign Area Cost-of-Living Allowances Price Survey Data Collection Procedures



Survey Description



The following information will be provided to the participants verbally or in writing. Participants who are familiar
with the program and the survey may be provided with less information as appropriate.



Purpose 

The Federal Government pays Cost-Of-Living-Allowances (COLA) in Alaska, Hawaii, and certain U.S. territories
and possessions. Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation,
and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington DC area.
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program.



Data Collection

OPM, or its representatives, conducts annual Price Surveys to determine living cost differences. Local governments,
retail outlets, realty firms, and businesses providing professional and other services to be surveyed are identified
through the use of full-scale Background Surveys, conducted approximately once every five years. Participation
in the Price Surveys is voluntary. Data are collected by telephone and/or personal interview

Wherever practical and appropriate, the price of each good or service is obtained from at least three outlets in each
allowance area and at least six outlets in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, DC, area). Realty data may be obtained
from one or multiple sources, as appropriate.



Release of Information



The price data collected from participating firms may be made available to Congress or to the general public upon request.
This includes the name of the company and prices of items or services surveyed. The names of proprietors, managers,

Nonforeign Area Cost-of-Living Allowances Background Survey Data Collection Procedures 


Survey Description 



The following information will be provided to the participants verbally or in writing. Participants who are familiar
with the program and the survey may be provided with less information as appropriate. 



Purpose 



The Federal Government pays Cost-Of-Living-Allowances (COLA) in Alaska, Hawaii, and certain U.S. territories
and possessions. Living cost differences are determined by comparing costs of goods, services, housing, transportation,
and other items in the allowance area with the cost of the same or similar items and services in the Washington, DC, area.
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the operation of the COLA program. OPM, or its representative,
conducts annual surveys to determine living cost differences. OPM conducts full-scale Background Surveys approximately
once every five years to review the appropriateness of items, services, and businesses covered in the annual Price
surveys. Elements of the Background Survey may be repeated annually on a limited basis as part of the maintenance of
and preparation for the annual Price Surveys. 

OPM uses the Background Survey to identify the services, items, quantities, outlets, and locations that will be surveyed
to collect living cost data within the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The Background Survey also is
used to collect information on local trade practices, consumer buying patterns, taxes and fees, and other economic
characteristics related to living costs. 



Data Collection 



Full-scale Background Surveys are conducted approximately once every five years. OPM identifies major manufacturers,
local governments, retail outlets, realty firms, and businesses providing professional services to be surveyed
on the basis of business volume and local prominence. Participation is voluntary. Data are collected by telephone
and/or personal interview. 



Confidentiality 



All data collected are used only for the purposes described above. The Government pledges to hold all micro or ``raw''
data collected in confidence. Names of participating businesses and institutions may be released. Names of individuals
are not released. Summary data will be made available to the public only to the extent that micro data cannot be associated
with data sources. 



Public Burden Information 



Public burden reporting for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 5 minutes to 30 minutes per response.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestion
for reducing this burden to Reports and Forms Management Officer, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street,

 (the allowance area or Washington, DC metropolitan area)? (Do not include second mortgages.)
2. What are the typical conditions and limitations on loans?
3. What is the typical amount(s) of down payment required? What are the terms and rates?

Real Estate Information


1. What is the availability of housing in 

XXXXXXXX

 (the allowance area or Washington, DC metropolitan area)? Of principal interest is housing for typical salary and
wage earners (as distinguished from retirees, tourists, or other special groups) for persons with low, moderate,
and high incomes.
2. Describe the communities within your area in which persons 

XXXXXXXX

 (specify occupation/income characteristics) typically live. If appropriate, identify separate communities
for renters and home owners. Where are these communities located relative to the major Federal activities in the area?
3. Describe the type of housing (e.g., apartment, condominium, town house, detached house).
4. For each type of housing, what are the usual number of rooms, bedrooms, baths, total square footage, lot size, type
of construction, and similar characteristics?
5. What types of utilities are available and typically used in these communities: sewer, water, natural gas, electricity,
others?

8. Is there anything else we should know about the housing market in your area? Are there suggestions or recommendations
you wish to make concerning our data collection?


Other Types of Information


Occasionally, it is necessary to collect information from colleges, universities, chambers of commerce, trade
associations, and other groups on specific subjects relating to the analysis of living costs. For example, a university
known to be involved in home energy research may be contacted to determine whether there are consumption data by region
or allowance area that could have application in the COLA program.
When such data are collected, the purpose and basic structure of the interview will follow the patterns shown above.
The substance, however, will vary with the subject matter.

Notes: Realty professionals indicate greater demand for rentals as a result of Iniki but believe prices are stable.
(This agrees with broker data trends.) Current data are good at middle and upper income levels but are weaker at lower
income levels. Therefore, previous year's rate at lower level is adjusted by the average of the rates of change at the

Notes: Realty professionals indicated that rental prices were declining earlier in the year but now are increasing
perhaps because of increased homeowner insurance costs as a result of typhoon Omar. Professionals believe tourism
is down, that this reduces demand and partially offsets rent increases that might otherwise occur. Number of observations
greater this year. Current data are good. Therefore, no adjustments made.

B=Broker only because less than 3 non-broker samples.
Overall average: 1.6%.
*Adjusted by overall average.
Notes: Realty professionals indicate that market is stable but tight because of college student population and demand
for units. Data trends are divergent, even among broker data. Therefore, rates of change at all three levels are averaged
and result (1.6%) used to adjust last year's results by income level.

Notes: Realty professionals say that rental rates are declining. However, change at middle income level is incongruous
with change at other two levels and beyond what realty professionals would expect. Therefore, rates of change at lower
and upper income levels are averaged and used to adjust previous year's rate at middle income level.

Definitions 


Applicants are encouraged to take particular note of the following definitions that are contained in 34 CFR 401.5:

``Act of April 16, 1934'' means the Federal law commonly known as the ``Johnson-O'Malley Act,'' that authorizes the
Secretary of the Interior to make contracts for the education of Indians and other purposes. 


``Bureau''

 means the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. 


``Bureau-Funded School''

 means_ 
(1) A Bureau-operated elementary or secondary day or boarding school or a Bureau-operated dormitory for students
attending a school other than a Bureau school; 
(2) An elementary or secondary school or a dormitory that receives financial assistance for its operation under a
contract or agreement with the Bureau under sections 102, 104(1), or 208 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450f, 450h(1), and 458d; or

``Indian Tribe''

 means any Indian tribe, band, Nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village
or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
(85 Stat. 688) that is federally recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United
States to Indians because of their status as Indians. 


``Tribal organization''

 means the recognized governing body of any Indian tribe or any legally established organization of Indians that is
controlled, sanctioned, or chartered by that governing body or that is democratically elected by the adult members
of the Indian community to be served by the organization and that includes the maximum participation of Indians in
all phases of its activities. However, in any case where a contract is let or grant made to an organization to perform
services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each of those Indian tribes must be a prerequisite
to the letting or making of that contract or grant. 


Invitational Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1) the Secretary is authorized to invite applications that meet certain priorities. In this
competition, the Secretary seeks to encourage Indian program applicants to initiate and establish tech-prep projects
that are similar to those operated by States under the Perkins Act. Therefore, the Secretary is particularly interested
in applications that meet the following invitational priority, although an application that meets this invitational
priority will not receive competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet this priority. 
Projects that propose a tech-prep education program that combines a secondary and postsecondary program and that_
(a) Leads to an associate degree or two-year certificate; 
(b) Provides technical preparation in at least one field of engineering technology, applied science, mechanical,
industrial, or practical art or trade, or agriculture, health, or business; 
(c) Builds student competence in mathematics, science, and communications (including through applied academics)
through a sequential course of study; and 
(d) Leads to placement in employment. 
Furthermore, the Secretary encourages applicants addressing this invitational priority to propose projects that
provide for the following: 
(a) An articulation agreement to be carried out between instructional and service providers at the secondary or adult
and postsecondary levels. (``Articulation agreement'' means a commitment to a program designed to provide students
with a non-duplicative sequence of progressive achievement leading to competencies in a tech-prep education program.)

(b) The implementation of an educational program that will be carried out under an articulation agreement between
the members of a consortium that includes the two years of secondary schooling preceding graduation (including programs
for adult learners) and either two years of higher education, or two years of apprenticeship training that follows
secondary level instruction. The program should also provide a common core of required proficiency in applied mathematics,
science, communications, and technologies designed to lead to an associate degree or a two-year certificate of proficiency
in a specific career field. 
(c) The development of tech-prep education curricula appropriate to the needs of the participants. 
(d) Inservice training for teachers that_
(1) Is designed to train teachers to implement curricula for a tech-prep education program effectively;

(b) Acquire, as a part of the planning activities, technical assistance from sources that have successfully designed,
established, and operated tech-prep programs.

Appendix B



Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants, the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions followed by the Department's
answers.

Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline?

A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and must apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.

Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound?

A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional.

Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit under another competition?

A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications
of the competition to which it is submitted.

Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do?

A. We are happy to discuss any such questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various
competitions.

Q. Will you help us prepare our application?

A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand, however, that prior contact with the Department
is not required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application.

Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded?

A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of Department competitions with similar closing dates.

Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome?

A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have a legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the panel review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify
a local school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that
point, we cannot share information about the results of panel review with anyone.

Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded?

A. No. We no longer return unsuccessful applications.

Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments?

A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants.

Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?

A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we may request the project director of funded
projects to attend an annual project directors' meeting, you may also wish to include a trip or two to Washington, DC
in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when the purpose of the conference will be of benefit
and relates to the project.

Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding?

A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications reviewed and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded.

Q. What happens during negotiations?

A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.''

These are issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are
met. Questions may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because an application
contains inadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant
to the successful completion of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the
project's success, you may provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly,
if proposed budget reductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why
and provide additional justification for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all issues under negotiation
have been resolved.

Q. How do I provide an assurance?

A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' you may provide an assurance simply by
stating in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.

Q. Where can copies of the 

Federal Register

, program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained?

A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;8228. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific
name or public law, number of a statute, or part number of a regulation. The material referenced in this notice should
be referred to as follows:

(1) The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;302).

(2) Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 90, 81, 82, and 85.

(3) 34 CFR part 401 (Indian Vocational Education Program) as published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 14, 1992 (57 FR 36730).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

A. Background 



The Department has recovered $627,778 from the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation
Services, in response to a claim arising from an audit conducted by the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG).
The audit covered Federal fiscal years (FYs) 1989, 1990, and 1991. 

The claim involved the State agency's administration of The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program under
Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The final audit determination of the Regional Commissioner,
which was issued on August 19, 1992, found that during FYs 1989, 1990, and 1991 the State agency had violated the regulatory
requirements in 34 CFR 361.44, including its assurance in section 8.9 of the approved State Plan, concerning the procedures
for authorizing client services. The OIG found instances in which the agency charged to one Federal fiscal year the
costs of client services that had been initiated or completed in the prior Federal fiscal year by deferring the issuance
of the agency's authorization form. As a result of these violations, the State agency had charged expenditures to
the wrong Federal fiscal years, thereby failing to preserve the integrity of Federal accountability requirements.
The final determination sought the recovery of $2,176,802 from the State agency. 

The State agency appealed the Regional Commissioner's determination to the Department's Office of Administrative
Law Judges (OALJ) (Application of the State of New Jersey Department of Labor: Docket No. 92&hyph;103&hyph;R) on
September 21, 1992. In a Joint Notice of Reduction of Claim and Motion to Dismiss, filed with the OALJ on February 11,
1993, both parties agreed that, based upon an analysis of all the evidence in the case, the amount of the disallowance
should be reduced to $627,778. The notice also certified that the State agency had returned the $627,778 to the Department
on January 22, 1993. On February 18, 1993, the OALJ dismissed the case. 

New Jersey DOL/DVRS has submitted a request for a grantback of $470,833 (75 percent) of the $627,778 recovered by the
Department of Education. In its request, DOL/DVRS provided documentation of the actions taken to correct the practices
of the State agency that resulted in the final audit determination. 

Following the audit, the State agency issued a new policy directive to field staff on the procedures for authorizing
and approving client services. The purpose of the new directive was to prevent charging case service expenditures
to the wrong Federal fiscal years. A subsequent site review of the State agency by the Department resulted in the agency
strengthening further its policies governing the procedures for case service authorizations. 



B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback 



Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that, whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following
a final audit determination with respect to an applicable program, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional
funds available for that program and may arrange to repay to the State agency affected by that determination an amount
not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this so-called ``grantback'' arrangement
if the Secretary determines that_

(a) The practices and procedures of the State agency that resulted in the final audit determination have been corrected
and the State agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with requirements of the applicable program; 

(b) The State agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement
that meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that was affected
by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and 

(c) The use of funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State agency's plan would
serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted. 



C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement 



In its December 13, 1993, request for a grantback, the State agency submitted a plan, in accordance with section 459(a)(2)
of GEPA, for the proposed use of the requested funds. In its plan, the State proposes to use the grantback of $470,833
plus the required State matching funds in the amount of $127,430 to supplement current program services to eligible
individuals with disabilities under The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program. The grantback and State
matching funds would be used to provide time-limited employment site job coaching and support services through traditional
community rehabilitation programs to increase the number of competitive placements in integrated settings made
by these traditional programs. 

There are currently 32 traditional programs that are CARF (Council on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities)
accredited and approved to provide work adjustment training and extended employment to DOL/DVRS. These traditional
programs, also known as sheltered workshops, most frequently serve individuals with the most severe disabilities.
In the majority of the cases, these individuals are rehabilitated as extended employees of the programs. According
to the agency, 402 individuals were placed in competitive work in integrated settings during or at the conclusion
of work adjustment training in FY 1993. By initiating time-limited employment site job coaching and support services
through these programs, DOL/DVRS expects placements in competitive work in integrated settings to increase by at
least 10 percent in both FY 1995 and FY 1996 compared to the number placed in FY 1993. 

Initiatives facilitating placements of individuals with disabilities in competitive work in integrated work settings
were identified as needs during public hearings concerning the reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act and DOL/DVRS'
State and Strategic Plans. 



D. The Secretary's Determinations 



The Secretary has reviewed the State agency's request for the repayment of funds, the State agency's plan (as outlined
in section C of this notice), and other information submitted by the State agency. Based upon that review, the Secretary
has determined that the conditions contained in section 459 of GEPA have been met. This determination is based upon
the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is, at a later date, discovered
to have been inaccurate or incomplete, the Secretary will not be precluded from taking appropriate administrative
action at that time. On finding that the conditions of section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination
concerning any pending audit recommendation or final audit determination.
