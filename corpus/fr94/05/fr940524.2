</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of determination.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing the issuance of a determination that glyphosate-tolerant
soybean line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 does not present a plant pest risk and should therefore no longer be a regulated article
under regulations at 7 CFR part 340. APHIS' determination has been made in response to a petition received on September
15, 1993, from Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, MO, seeking such a determination. This notice also announces the availability
of the determination, which provides the basis for the ruling, as well as the availability of an environmental assessment
of this action. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This ruling is effective May 18, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 6, 1993, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 64287&hyph;64288, Docket No. 93&hyph;148&hyph;1), announcing receipt of a petition from the Monsanto Co.
of St. Louis, MO, that requested a determination on the regulatory status of glyphosate-tolerant soybean (GTS) line
40&hyph;3&hyph;2. This notice also indicated APHIS' role, as well as those of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, in the regulation of GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2, food products derived
from it, and the herbicide glyphosate that may be used in conjunction with it, if a new label for the herbicide is approved.
This notice further announced that the petition was available for public review and invited written comments on whether
such soybeans present a plant pest risk, to be submitted on or before February 4, 1994. 



Comments 



APHIS received a total of 33 comments on the Monsanto petition from farm cooperatives, farmers, a food company, national
and State soybean associations, a science and technology policy organization, seed companies and affiliated research
organizations, a State agricultural commodity commission for soybeans, State departments of agriculture, universities,
and a university agricultural experiment station. With a single exception, the comments were favorable to the petition.
APHIS has provided a discussion of the comments in the determination document, which is available upon request from
the individual listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 

GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 is described by Monsanto as soybeans containing a Roundup Ready

TM

 gene, and any progeny derived from crosses between GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 and traditional soybean varieties.
The Roundup Ready

TM

 gene contained in GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 is a single insert of DNA comprised of the enhanced 35S promoter derived
from cauliflower mosaic virus, the chloroplast transit peptide coding sequence from 

Petunia hybrida

 fused to the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene derived from 

Agrobacterium

 sp. strain CP4, and the nopaline synthase 3' terminator from 

A. tumefaciens

. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup

&reg;

 herbicide, controls weeds due to the inhibition of the enzyme EPSPS. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 soybeans express
an EPSPS enzyme tolerant to glyphosate, thereby conferring tolerance to Roundup

&reg;

 herbicide. 

GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 contains components from organisms that are known plant pathogens, i.e., the bacterium


A. tumefaciens

 and cauliflower mosaic virus. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 has, therefore, been a regulated article under 7 CFR part
340, and was field tested in 1991, 1992, and 1993 in accordance with APHIS regulations. APHIS' determination that
GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 does not present a plant pest risk is based on an analysis of data and information provided
by Monsanto, as well as other relevant published scientific data and comments received by APHIS concerning the potential
plant pest risk of the soybean line. From this review, we have determined that the GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2: (1) Exhibits
no plant pathogenic properties; (2) is no more likely to become a weed than its nonengineered parental variety; (3)
is unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which the
organism can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; and (5) is unlikely to
harm other organisms, such as bees and earthworms, that are beneficial to agriculture. In addition, we have determined
that there is no reason to believe that new progeny bred from GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 will exhibit new plant pest
properties, i.e., properties substantially different from any observed for the field tested GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2,
or those observed for soybeans in traditional breeding programs. 

The effect of this determination is that GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 will no longer be considered a regulated article
under APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340. Permits and notifications under those regulations will no longer be required
from APHIS for field testing, importation, or interstate movement of those soybean lines or their progeny. Agronomic
practices involving the GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2, e.g., cultivation, propagation, movement, and cross-breeding
with other nonregulated soybean lines, can now be conducted without APHIS' approval. Importation of GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2
and seeds capable of propagation is still, however, subject to the restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notice
regulations at 7 CFR part 319. Variety registration and/or seed certification for individual soybean lines carrying
the Roundup Ready

TM

 gene may involve future actions by the U.S. Plant Variety Protection Office and State Seed Certification officials.


The potential environmental impacts associated with this determination have been examined in accordance with:
(1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 USC 4321 

et seq.

, (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). An environmental assessment
was prepared and a finding of no significant impact was reached by APHIS for the determination that GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2
is no longer a regulated article under its regulations at 7 CFR part 340.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A previously published Notice of Intent (FR Vol. 59, No. 64, April 4, 1994, Pages 15702&hyph;3) announced Forest Service
plans to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade and expand the Crested Butte Ski
Area. The announcement noted a general information meeting to discuss the proposed expansion, and the associated
EIS, with the public. Due to a clerical error, the notice was published after the date of the meeting, March 29, 1994
(not 1993 as indicated in the notice). Notice of the meeting was widely circulated locally, and approximately 80 people
attended. As a result, the Forest Service believes the meeting adequately provided general information to the public.
Other meetings will be scheduled for this purpose should the need arise. Also, the Forest Service has extended the
scoping period by one month from June 1, 1994 to July 1, 1994, to insure adequate time for public input.

This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.904_Watershed Protection and
Flood Prevention_and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials.



Introduction



The Battery Creek High School Recreational Facility is a federally assisted action authorized for planning under
Public Law 97&hyph;98, the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981. An environmental assessment was undertaken in conjunction
with the development of the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) Measure Plan. This assessment was
conducted in consultation with local, State, and Federal agencies as well as with interested organizations and individuals.
Data developed during the assessment are available for public review at the following location:




U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1835 Assembly St., room 950, Columbia, SC 29201.



Recommended Action



The proposal includes the construction of a running track at the Battery Creek High School. The High School, Beaufort
County School district and the local athletic committee have committed over 78% of the funds needed for the project.
The engineering plans and specifications have been completed by the school district and only financial assistance
is requested. State and/or local permits concerning water or air pollution will be obtained prior to construction
by the local sponsors. The Corps of Engineers 404 permit and South Carolina Coastal Council authorizations will not
be required.



Effect of Recommended Action



The Battery Creek High School has an enrollment of 1,200 students of which 61.5% are minority. Improved recreational
facilities will enable students to practice and compete with other schools which will increase self-esteem, reduce
dropout rate, improve grades to remain eligible to participate in sports, and, overall, will develop a more well-rounded
citizen.

No land use changes will occur as the track will be constructed on an established recreational area. The proposed action
will have no effect on wetlands nor will it affect archaeological and historical areas, since the track will be built
around an existing football field.

Endangered or threatened plants or animals are not known to exist on the site. The topography of the site is generally
flat and all adjacent lands are protected with permanent grass. The soil is Sewee Fine Sand and is not considered to
be prime or important farmland. The area has been committed to recreation by the school.

No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of this project.



Alternatives



The planned action will provide a high quality track and field facility which will minimize injuries and allow the
students to compete with other school districts in field and track competition, thereby developing self esteem and
student pride.

Because no significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installation of the measures, no other alternatives,
other than the no project, were considered.



Consultation_Public Participation



Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for
Federal Assistance on February 11, 1994.

An interdisciplinary scoping trip was not conducted because the proposed project is planned to be placed on previously
developed school property.

Public meetings with regard to this project have been conducted during local district meetings and by actions of the
stadium committee and booster clubs.

The stadium committee and booster clubs are volunteer organizations with a goal of improving the athletic facilities
of Battery Creek High School. The ultimate objective being to provide a better atmosphere to improve learning and
produce better citizens for the community and the area. These organizations have raised over $5,000 toward this project.



Conclusion



The environmental assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local,
regional or national adverse impacts on the environment. Therefore, based on the above findings, I have determined
that an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Battery Creek High School Recreation Facility RC&amp;D project
is not required.

<RINDOCK>[Docket 20&hyph;94]</RINDOCK>



Proposed Foreign-Trade Subzone; Chevron U.S.A. Products Company (Oil Refinery); Philadelphia, PA



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Philadelphia Regional Port
Authority, grantee of FTZ 35, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the oil refinery complex of Chevron
U.S.A. Products Company (Chevron), a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, located in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 11, 1993.


The refinery complex (707 acres, 1,195 employees) consists of four sites and connecting pipelines, located near
the junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers in southwestern Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 

Site 1

 (372 acres)_175,000 BPD refinery, Lanier Avenue, east side of the Schuylkill River; 

Site 2

 (203 acres)_Schuylkill River Tank Farm, west side of the Schuylkill River across from the refinery; 

Site 3

 (116 acres)_Darby Creek Tank Farm, Falcon Hook Rd., 3 miles northwest of the refinery; and 

Site 4

 (16 acres)_Hog Island Wharf, 3 miles southwest of the refinery, on the Delaware River, adjacent to the Philadelphia
International Airport. The wharf, storage facilities and pipelines operate as an integral part of the refinery.
The refinery is used to produce fuel and chemical products. Fuels produced include gasoline, jet fuel, heavy fuel
oil, diesel fuel, and light naphtha. Chemical products produced include liquified petroleum gas and butane; petrochemical
feedstocks, such as cumene; and refinery byproducts, such as sulfur. All of the crude oil (95 percent of inputs) and
certain blendstocks are sourced from abroad. 

The application requests authority to use zone procedures primarily for export activity at this time and indicates
that Chevron will accept approval subject to the standard oil refinery restrictions (privileged foreign status
on incoming foreign merchandise and full duties on fuel consumed). At the outset, one of the main uses of zone procedures
would involve the refining of foreign crude oil for jet fuel that is sold for international flights, displacing foreign-sourced
jet fuel that is imported duty- and tax-free under Customs' bonded fuel program. 

Zone procedures would exempt Chevron from Customs duty payments on the foreign products used in its exports, including
jet fuel sold for international flights. The company would be able to defer Customs duties on finished products shipped
to U.S. markets. (The duty on crude oil ranges from 5.25 to 10.5 cents/barrel.) Jet fuel sold for international flights
also would be exempt from state sales and excise taxes. 

MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) is one of the blendstocks sourced from abroad. The company would be able to defer
Customs duties on MTBE blended into motor gasoline and shipped to U.S. markets. (The duty on MTBE is 5.6% 

ad valorem

). The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the refinery's international
competitiveness. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board. 

Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the
Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 25, 1994. Rebuttal
comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day
period August 8, 1994. 

A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:




U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, suite 201, 660 American Avenue, King of Prussia, PA 19406.

Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, room 3716, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th &amp;

<RINDOCK>[Project No. 1417; Project No. 1835]</RINDOCK>


Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District Nebraska Public Power District; Public Meetings and Extending
Time to Comment on Revised Draft EIS


May 18, 1994.




The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (RDEIS)
for the Kingsley Dam, Project No. 1417, and the Keystone Dam, Project No. 1835, (Platte River Projects) on April 1,
1994. These two hydropower projects are located on the Platte River in Nebraska. 
In response to a motion filed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI), and supported by other parties to the relicensing
proceedings, FERC staff will host a two-day technical workshop on the hydrological model used in the RDEIS. Additionally,
FERC staff will conduct two public meetings in conjunction with the staff's preparation of the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS). The workshop and meetings are scheduled from June 8 through June 10, 1994. 
FERC is also extending the comment period on the RDEIS until July 25, 1994, which is 45 days after the completion of the
two-day technical workshop. This extension is also in response to the motion filed by the USDI, and supported by other
parties to the proceedings. 



Public Meetings 


Commission staff will conduct two public meetings for the Platte River Projects. The purpose of the meetings is to
solicit public comment on alternatives to be addressed in the FEIS. All interested individuals, organizations,
and agencies are invited to attend the meetings. 
The first public meeting for the Platte River Projects will be conducted on Wednesday evening, June 8, 1994, from 7
p.m. to 10 p.m. in the auditorium of the North Platte High School at 1000 West 2nd Street in North Platte. The second public
meeting will be conducted on June 9, 1994, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the auditorium of the Clifford Hardin Center for Continuing
Education on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska at 33rd and Holdredge, in Lincoln. 



Technical Workshop 


Commission staff will also host a two-day technical workshop for the Platte River projects. The workshop will be held
in the Scottsbluff/Menden Room in the Clifford Hardin Center for Continuing Education on the East Campus of the University
of Nebraska at 33rd and Holdredge in Lincoln. Interested persons are welcome to attend, but participation will be
restricted to parties to the relicensing proceedings. 
The first day of the workshop will be on Thursday June 9, 1994, from 9:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. The purpose of the first day
of the workshop is to address technical questions on the hydrological modeling used in the RDEIS. Thursday's session
will provide an opportunity for reviewers to fully understand the hydrology analysis but will not serve as a forum
to debate the merits of the RDEIS. To enhance the productivity of the first day of the workshop, the Commission requests
that any questions on the model the parties would like addressed be sent to our office via facsimile. The cover sheet
of the facsimile should be addressed to Frankie Green at (202) 219&hyph;0125 or Mark Killgore at (206) 451&hyph;4980.
Copies of all questions received will be made available at the workshop. If we complete discussion on the parties'
questions on the hydrological model, we will begin discussing items scheduled for Friday. The meeting will still
adjourn at 4 p.m. 
The second day of the workshop will be on Friday June 10, 1994, from 7:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. Friday's session will
allow parties to clarify technical matters discussed in the RDEIS. 


Meeting Procedures 


All of the meetings will be recorded by a stenographer, and all meeting statements (oral and written) will become part
of the Commission's public record of this proceeding. Anyone wishing to receive a copy of the transcripts of the meetings
may contact Ann Riley &amp; Associates by calling (202) 293&hyph;3950, or writing to 1612 K Street, NW, Suite 300,
Washington, DC 20006. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to sign in before the meetings
start and to identity themselves for the record. 

Anyone wishing to comment in writing on the RDEIS, including workshop results, must do so no later than July 25, 1994.
Comments should be addressed to: Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 
Reference should be clearly made to: the Kingsley Dam (Project No. 1417) and North Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization </DOCTITLE>


May 18, 1994. 



Take notice that on May 5, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FTG), 1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;529&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization, under its blanket certificate
issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;553&hyph;000, to upgrade an existing meter station, all as more fully set forth in
the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

FGT states that the subject Residential Meter Station is being used to measure gas deliveries to the Reedy Creek Improvement
District (Reedy Creek) and is being upgraded at the customer's request for an estimated $26,000 to be reimbursed to
FGT. The meter station's location is Township 24 south, Range 28 east, Section 21 or, more specifically, near mile
post 4.2 on FGT's existing Reedy Creek Lateral in Orange County, Florida. 

FGT's proposed upgrading will involve removing the first stage of pressure regulation and replacing the second stage
of pressure regulation, including inlet and outlet spools, risers, primary header (inlet side of regulator), and
other related appurtenant facilities to increase the 150 psig delivery pressure to 250 psig. The construction activity
will be done inside FGT's existing gravel and fenced meter station yard. 

FGT states that Reedy Creek will not have any changes in its certificated levels of service or any increases in its contractual
gas quantities. The upgrading will not affect FGT's peak day or annual deliveries, so the present and proposed quantity
to be delivered at the Residential Division will remain at up to 4,204 MMBtu per day and up to 1,112,516 MMBtu per year.
FGT does state that the end-use will be residential and commercial. 

FGT has indicated that the proposed upgrading is not prohibited by its existing tariff and there is sufficient capacity
to continue all services without detriment or disadvantage to other customers. 

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<DOCTITLE>Williams Natural Gas Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.



Take notice that on May 16, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in
Docket No. CP94&hyph;547&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to relocate the Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Derby
town border and to abandon in place approximately 2.25 miles of 4-inch and 6-inch lateral pipeline located in Sedgwick
County, Kansas, under WNG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000 pursuant to Section
7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection.

WNG proposes to relocate the Derby town border to the site of the existing high pressure regulator setting and to abandon
in place approximately 2.25 miles of lateral pipeline. The projected volume of delivery is not expected to exceed
the total volume currently being delivered. The estimated cost of construction is approximately $42,212, which
will be paid from funds on hand and the reclaim cost is estimated to be $2,946. WNG states that this change is not prohibited
by an existing tariff and it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries specified without detriment or
disadvantage to its other customers.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to

<DOCTITLE>Termination of Execption Relief</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Hearings and Appeals, 
Department of Energy.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Termination of exception relief and opportunity to file refund applications (Case No. LFX&hyph;0008).

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the final procedures for the disbursement
of a portion of the approximately $131,000,000, plus interest, obtained by the DOE as the result of the termination
of exception relief granted to the 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The OHA determined that each refiner's share
of the available Citronelle fund would be based on the percentage of its runs to stills on the Entitlements List for
November 1980. Further, the OHA determined a presumptive level of absorption of the additional cost of the Citronelle
recertification of 5.4 percent. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES AND ADDRESSES:

 Applications for Refund will be accepted from those participants on the DOE's November 1980 Entitlements List which
have not previously filed briefs or evidence in this proceeding on the refiner absorption issue. (Those refiners
which previously filed refund applications in this Citronelle proceeding need not file again.) The Applications
must be postmarked no later than June 15, 1995, and should be addressed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department
of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. All applications should display a reference to Case
Number RF345.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Notice is hereby given of the issuance of a final Decision and Order, dated May 18, 1994, entitled the 341 Tract Unit
of the Citronelle Field, that provides for the procedures the DOE will use to disburse the escrowed funds which were
received as a result of the termination of exception relief granted to the 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The
exception relief permitted the Unit to recertify a sufficient quantity of its prior production of price-controlled
crude oil to produce $63.8 million. The funds generated by the recertification were placed in an escrow account. These
funds, with accrued interest, now total approximately $131,000,000. Interest continues to accrue on the funds,
which are presently deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the United States Department
of the Treasury. 



The recertification by the Unit had the effect of raising per-barrel prices of crude oil to crude oil refiners who were
participants in the Entitlements Program as of November 1980. Accordingly, as part of a proceeding akin to that set
forth at 10 CFR subpart V (Special Procedures for Distribution of Refunds), the OHA decided to consider what portion
of the escrowed funds should be reserved for refunds for those participants. The OHA invited interested parties to
submit evidence regarding the refiners' level of absorption of the cost of the Citronelle recertification. 

The OHA received briefs and evidence submitted by a group of Refiners, a group of States and a group of End-users regarding
the amount of the Citronelle recertification that refiners absorbed. The OHA also convened an evidentiary hearing
and oral argument regarding this issue. After considering all the evidence, the OHA determined in the Decision that
the Refiners had not shown that they absorbed the cost of the Citronelle recertification at a level greater than the
5.4 percent overall average absorption rate found in the OHA's Stripper Well Report. Accordingly, the OHA decided
to adopt a presumptive absorption rate of 5.4 percent of the cost of the Citronelle recertification. 

The OHA further determined that each refiner's portion of the available Citronelle funds (its allocable share) would
be its percentage of the total runs to stills on the November 1980 Entitlements List. The OHA stated that it would apply
the 5.4 percent presumption to the refiners' allocable shares. The OHA set forth a list of the information that should
be included in all Citronelle refund applications. 

In a previous determination, the OHA directed refiner applicants who submitted briefs and evidence regarding the
absorption issue to file Citronelle refund applications concurrently with their refund claims. We received claims
from 25 refiners during that phase of the Citronelle proceeding. Refiners that were named on the November 1980 Entitlements
list and that did not submit briefs and applications during that phase of the Citronelle proceeding should do so at
this time. These applications must be postmarked by June 15, 1995. 

Copies of the Decision and Order may be obtained through the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals
at 1000 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20585. Further, this Decision will be published in Federal Energy Guidelines,
a commercially published loose leaf reporter system.

You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be

<DOCTITLE>Consumer Advisory Council; Notice of Meeting of Consumer Advisory Council</DOCTITLE>



The Consumer Advisory Council will meet on Thursday, June 23. The meeting, which will be open to public observation,
will take place in the Board Room of the Eccles Building. The meeting is expected to begin at 9 a.m. and to continue until
4 p.m., with a lunch break from 1 until 2 p.m. The Eccles Building is located on C Street, Northwest, between 20th and
21st Streets in Washington, DC.

The Council's function is to advise the Board on the exercise of the Board's responsibilities under the Consumer Credit
Protection Act and on other matters on which the Board seeks its advice. Time permitting, the Council will discuss
the following topics:




Community Reinvestment Act Reform. 

Discussion of issues related to the interagency proposal to revise regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment
Act.



Interagency Policy Statement on Fair Lending. 

Discussion led by the Community Affairs and Housing Committee on the policy statement on fair lending recently adopted
by the Board and nine other federal agencies_in particular whether additional guidance is necessary and on what issues.




Sale of Mutual Funds and Other Uninsured Instruments by Depository Institutions. 

Discussion led by the Depository and Delivery Systems Committee on possible ways to address consumer confusion that
may arise when uninsured investments are sold to the public by depository institutions, which historically have
offered only insured savings instruments.



Truth in Savings Proposal. 

Discussion led by the Depository and Delivery Systems Committee on a proposal by the Board to amend Regulation DD (Truth
in Savings) to clarify that interest credited to an account becomes part of the principal, and thus is subject to compounding;
the proposal would allow institutions to continue to use an existing formula for calculating the annual percentage
yield, whereas an earlier proposal would have required a new formula for certain accounts.



Home Ownership Counseling Models. 

Report by the Community Affairs and Housing Committee on the key elements of successful home ownership counseling
programs, elements that should be present in any home ownership counseling program sponsored, recognized or supported
by a bank.



Governor's Report. 

Report by Federal Reserve Board Member Lawrence B. Lindsey on economic conditions, recent Board initiatives, and
issues of concern, with an opportunity for questions from Council members.



Members Forum. 

Presentation of individual Council members' views on the economic conditions present within their industries or
local economies (including whether it is getting easier to obtain a loan, and whether there is a strong focus on lending
in the inner cities).



Committee Reports. 

Reports from Council committees on their work.

Other matters previously considered by the Council or initiated by Council members also may be discussed.

Persons wishing to submit to the Council their views regarding any of the above topics may do so by sending written statements
to Ann Marie Bray, Secretary, Consumer Advisory Council, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. Comments must be received no later than close of business Monday,
June 20, and must be of a quality suitable for reproduction.

Information with regard to this meeting may be obtained from Bedelia Calhoun, Staff Specialist, Consumer Advisory

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
Hawthorne Communications, Inc. (``respondent'' or ``Hawthorne'').
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.


Description of Complaint


This matter concerns advertising practices related to the sale of Tronsoft Inc.'s Freedom Now Home Business Starter
Kit (``Starter Kit''). The Commission's complaint, issued on November 16, 1993, alleges that Hawthorne promoted
the sale of the Starter Kit by scripting and producing a 30-minute television commercial entitled ``Freedom Now,''
which was broadcast in various areas throughout the United States.
The complaint alleges that through the use of statements and depictions contained in the ``Freedom Now'' commercial,
respondent Hawthorne falsely represented that consumers who use the Starter Kit will typically and readily succeed
in starting and operating a business out of their homes and will typically earn substantial income. In addition, the
complaint alleges that Hawthorne falsely represented that testimonials appearing in the commercial reflected
both the actual experiences of the people appearing as testimonialists and the typical experiences of members of
the public who had used the Starter Kit. Finally, the complaint alleges that Hawthorne, at the time it made various
representations in the commercial, lacked a reasonable basis that substantiated those representations.


Description of the Proposed Consent Order


The proposed consent order contains provisions which are designed to remedy the alleged advertising violations
and to prevent the respondent from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. The proposed order prohibits
respondent from disseminating the ``Freedom Now'' commercial and from misrepresenting that consumers who use the
Starter Kit (or any substantially similar product) can typically use such product to start a business and earn substantial
income. The proposed order would further prohibit Hawthorne from making any representations about the performance,
benefits, efficacy or success rate of any product or service concerning business opportunities unless Hawthorne
possesses competent and reliable evidence that substantiates such representations. The proposed order also contains
prohibitions about using or misusing testimonials and endorsements. In particular, the order prohibits Hawthorne
from using testimonials that do not reflect the actual opinions, beliefs, or experiences of the endorser and from
falsely representing that any testimonial reflects the typical experiences of members of the public who use the product
being advertised.
The proposed order would require Hawthorne to distribute the proposed order to its divisions and to officers, agents,
and any employees with advertising responsibilities. The order also requires respondent to notify the Commission
of any changes in its corporate structure and to retain for five years all materials that it relies upon in making representations
covered by the order, as well as all materials that call the representations into question. Finally, the order requires
Hawthorne to file compliance reports within sixty days and at other times as the Commission may order.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify its terms in any way. The proposed consent
order has been entered into for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.

Proposed consent agreement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, a Connecticut-based
company from representing that any of its paper products or packages are degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable,
or offers any environmental benefits when disposed of in a sanitary landfill, unless the respondent possesses competent
and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate such representation. In addition, the consent agreement would
prohibit the respondent from misrepresenting the extent to which any paper product or package is capable of being
recycled or the extent to which recycling collection programs are available.

It Is Hereby Agreed by and between Keyes Fibre Company, by its duly authorized officer, and its attorney, and counsel

3. Proposed respondent waives:

(a) Any further procedural steps;

(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

4. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft of the complaint contemplated
hereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the attached draft complaint or that the facts as alleged in the attached draft

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently

provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service
of the decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement shall
constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it might have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or in the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.

7. Proposed respondent has read the complaint and the order contemplated hereby. It understands that once the order
has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing it has fully complied with the order.
Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law for
each violation of the order after it becomes final.

Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondent Keyes Fibre Company, a Delaware corporation.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of the respondent's Chinet

#

 disposable tableware. The Commission's complaint in this matter charges that the respondent represented without
substantiation that Chinet

#

 disposable tableware will completely break down and return to nature_

i.e., 

decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal; that
Chinet

#

 disposable tableware offers a significant environmental benefit after customary disposal; that Chinet

#

 disposable tableware will completely break down and return to nature within a short enough period of time after customary
disposal to significantly reduce the amount of garbage in landfills; and that Chinet

#

 disposable tableware will completely break down and return to nature significantly faster than other paper plates,
or plastic or foam products, to provide a significant environmental benefit. The complaint further charges that
the respondent falsely represented that Chinet

#

 disposable tableware is compostable through municipal solid waste composting. In fact, the complaint alleges,
while Chinet

#

 disposable tableware is capable of be composted in municipal solid waste composting facilities, the vast majority
of consumers cannot compost the product in this way because there are only a few municipal solid waste composting facilities
nationwide. In addition, the complaint charges that Keyes falsely represented that Chinet

#

 disposable tableware is recyclable after ordinary use. In fact, the complaint alleges, while Chinet

#

 disposable tableware is capable of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle the product because
there are virtually no collection facilities that accept used paper plates for recycling.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondent
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondent cease and desist from representing in the future, in any manner,
directly or by implication, that any of its paper products or packages are degradable, biodegradable, or photodegradable,
or through the use of such terms or similar terms, that any such product or package offers any environmental benefits
when consumers dispose of it as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless at the time of making such representation,
the respondent possesses and relies upon competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates such representation.
This provision includes claims of photodegradation as part of the prospective relief to be obtained, although respondent's
advertising did not include the term ``photodegradable.'' Part I also contains a proviso that allows the respondent
to advertise paper products or packages as degradable without violating Part I of the proposed order. The respondent
may do so if it truthfully represents that such product or package will degrade into usable compost (

e.g., 

soil-conditioning material, mulch) in a safe and timely manner, when disposed of in home compost piles or devices
or in municipal solid waste composting facilities, provided that the respondent complies with Part II of the proposed
order, discussed below, and in addition, the respondent discloses clearly, prominently, and in close proximity
to the claim that such product or package is not designed to degrade in landfills.

Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondent cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly
or by implication, with respect to any paper product or package the extent to which any such product or package is capable
of being composted or the extent to which municipal solid waste composting facilities are available. Part II also
contains a proviso that allows the respondent to advertise paper products or packages as compostable without violating
Part II of the proposed order. The respondent may do so if it truthfully represents that such products or packages are
capable of being composted or otherwise being converted into usable compost (

e.g., 

soil-conditioning material, mulch) in a safe and timely manner, when disposed of in home compost piles or devices
or in municipal solid waste composting facilities and discloses clearly, prominently, and in close proximity to
any representation referring or relating to municipal solid waste composting: (1) That such product or package is
compostable where municipal solid waste composting facilities exist, and the current number of municipal solid
waste composting facilities in the U.S.; or (2) that such product or package is compostable in the few communities
with municipal solid waste composting facilities; or (3) the approximate percentage of U.S. communities or the U.S.
population to which municipal solid waste composting facilities are available.

Part III of the proposed order requires that the respondent cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner,
directly or by implication, with respect to any paper product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled
or the extent to which recycling collection programs are available.

Part IV of the proposed order provides that if the respondent represents in advertising or labeling that any product
or package offers any environmental benefit, it must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable
evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims.

Part V of the proposed order allows the respondent to use the terms cited in parts I, II and III or similar terms, and not
be in violation of the proposed order, if it is necessary for the respondent to comply with any federal rule, regulation,
or law governing the use of such terms in advertising or labeling.

The proposed order also requires the respondent to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

any claim regarding the performance, safety, attributes, benefits, or efficacy of the electric and electronic products
they market unless they possess competent and reliable evidence that substantiates the representation. In addition,
the consent agreement would prohibit the respondents from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity,

The Federal Trade Commission, having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of Lifestyle Fascination,

It Is Hereby Agreed by and between Lifestyle Fascination, Inc., by its duly authorized officer, and Eli Zabare, individually

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Lifestyle Fascination, Inc.
(``Lifestyle''), Eli Zabare, an officer of Lifestyle, and Simon Pantierer.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns five products advertised by the respondents in the Lifestyle Fascination catalog: Fuelon,
a gasoline additive; the Vitalizer an automobile retrofit device; the Brain Tuner, a cranio-electric stimulation
device, the Rhythm, an electronic acupuncture device; and the Aerobic Eye Exercise Glasses, pinhole eyeglasses.

The Commission's proposed complaint alleges that the respondents falsely represented that the addition of Fuelon
to gasoline would increase a car's gas mileage by between 15% and 40% and ensure that cars pass government emissions
inspections. The proposed complaint further alleges that the respondents falsely represented that they relied
upon a reasonable basis for those claims, and for their further representation that Fuelon would provide the benefits
of an engine tune-up.

The proposed complaint alleges that the respondents falsely represented that the Vitalizer would increase gas mileage
by up to 23%; decrease automobile emissions by up to 90%; and that tests, research, and expert evaluations proved these
claims. The complaint further alleges that the respondents falsely represented that they relied upon a reasonable
basis for these representations, and for their further representation that use of the Vitalizer would increase engine
power.

The proposed complaint further alleges that, in advertising the Brain Tuner, the respondents falsely represented
that they relied upon a reasonable basis for their representations that use of the Brian Tuner would increase one's
I.Q., increase energy levels, improve concentration, control pain, reduce depression and anxiety, normalize sleep
patterns and reduce sleep requirements, improve memory, and reduce cravings for and withdrawal symptoms from drugs
and alcohol. The proposed complaint further alleges that the respondents falsely represented that scientific studies
proved that use of the Brain Tuner would produce these results.

The proposed complaint further alleges that, in advertising the Rhythm, the respondents falsely represented that
they relied upon a reasonable basis for their representations that use of the Rhythm would relieve muscle, digestive,
and nervous ailments; tone muscles; help the user lose weight; and relieve backaches, headaches, muscle pain, stiff
shoulders, insomnia, and fatigue.

With respect toe the respondent's advertising for the Aerobic Eye Exercise Glasses, the proposed complaint alleges
that the respondents falsely represented that wearing the glasses results in long-term vision improvement, that
they are an adequate substitute for prescription glasses or contact lenses, and that the testimonial contained in
the advertisement reflected the typical or ordinary experience of consumers who have used the product. The proposed
complaint further alleges that the respondents falsely represented that they relied upon a reasonable basis for
these representations.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts
and practices in the future. Parts I, II, and III of the proposed order prohibit the respondents from making the representations
challenged as false in the proposed complaint for Fuelon, Vitalizer, and the Aerobic Eye Exercise Glasses.

Part IV of the proposed order prohibit the respondents from misrepresenting the existence, contents validity, results,
conclusions, or interpretations of any test or study.

Part V of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from representing that use of any automotive fuel economy product
will result in fuel economy improvement unless they rely upon competent ad reliable scientific tests which substantiate
such representations. This part of the order lists two test procedures as examples of ``competent and reliable scientific
tests`` of automotive fuel economy products and further requires the respondents to disclose any limitations upon
the applicability of any test results to other vehicles. This part also requires the respondents to include the following
disclaimer when making certain fuel economy improvement claims: ``REMINDER: Your actual saving may vary. It depends
on the kind of driving you do how you drive, and the condition of your car.''

Part IV of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from representing that the use of any product will have any
effect on specific medical conditions or any other effect on health or the structure or function of the human body,
or that any product will have any effect on automobile performance, unless they possess competent and reliable scientific
evidence that substantiates the representation.

Part VII of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from making any representation for any consumer electric
or electronic product regarding its performance, safety, attributes, benefits or efficacy unless they possess
competent and reliable evidence, which, when appropriate, must be competent and reliable scientific evidence that
substantiates the representation. The terms of Part VII do not apply to representations made for a specified list
of products; however, these products are not exempted from the other terms of the order.

Part VIII of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from misrepresenting that any endorsement for a product
represented or intended to have any effect on health or the structure or function of the human body reflects the typical
or ordinary experience of members of the public who use the product.

Parts IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII relate to the respondents' obligation to maintain records, distribute the order to current
and future officers and employees, notify the Commission of changes in business or corporate structure, and file
compliance reports with the Commission.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate the public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

National Program of Cancer Registries 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements to support statewide cancer registries. The program will serve two purposes: 





Part I: To support and enhance existing State cancer registries so that they are statewide and population-based.


Part II: To plan, implement, and support statewide population-based cancer registries where State registries do
not currently exist.


 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Cancer and Surveillance and Data Systems. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'')


 



Authority 

This program is authorized by sections 399H, 399I, 399J, and 399L [42 U.S.C. 280e, e&hyph;1 and e&hyph;4] of the Public
Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;515, the Cancer Registries Amendment Act. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants for part I or for part II are the official public health agencies of States, or academic or nonprofit
organizations designated by the State to operate the State's cancer registry. This includes the District of Columbia,
American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Competition is limited
to these States in accordance with the authorizing legislation, the Cancer Registries Amendment Act of 1992. 

Eligible applicants may apply for either part I or part II.


 

Part I: Applicants applying for part I must have a central registry at the State level, continuous and recent data collection
efforts, existing core staff, and policies and procedures in place. State health agencies or their designees requesting
funds to support and enhance existing State cancer registries (part I) are not eligible to apply for funds for planning
and implementation of statewide cancer registries (part II). 

Part II: Only States with a limited or no established State cancer registry are eligible to apply for funds for planning
and implementation of a statewide cancer registry. State health agencies or their designees requesting funds for
planning and implementing a statewide, population-based cancer registry (part II) are not eligible to apply for
funds for the support and enhancement of existing State cancer registries (part I). 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $14 million is available in FY 1994 to fund programs under parts I and II of this announcement: 







</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-2-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-2-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Part I: Support and enhancement of existing State cancer registries (Section 399H). 
Approximately $11 million is available in FY 1994 to fund up to 40 States to support and enhance existing State registries.
It is expected that the average award to support and enhance an existing State registry will be $300,000, ranging from
$150,000 to $1,000,000. 

Part II: Planning and implementation of statewide cancer registries (Section 3991). 
Approximately $3 million is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 10 awards to plan and implement a statewide
cancer registry in States where one does not exist. It is expected that the average award will be $300,000, ranging
from $150,000 to $400,000. 




Awards for both Part I and Part II are expected to begin on or about September 1994 and will be made for a 12-month budget
period within a project period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 

Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. Additional funds may become available in support of building public health information infrastructure
in FY 1994. 



Recipient Financial Participation 



Recipient financial participation is required for this program announcement in accordance with the authorizing
legislation for Part I applicants only: 

A. Recipients of funds under Part I must agree, with respect to the costs of the program, to make available (directly
or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that
is not less than 25 percent of such cost or $1 for every $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant. [Sec. 399H(b)(1)] 

B. In determining the amount of non-Federal contributions under A. (above), the recipient may include only such contributions
as are in excess of the amount of such contributions made by the State toward the collection of data on cancer for the
fiscal year preceding the first year of funding under this announcement. CDC may decrease the amount of non-Federal
contributions required if the State can demonstrate that decreasing such amount is appropriate because of financial
hardship. [Sec. 399H(b)(2)]. 

Applicants will be notified of the details regarding criteria for defining ``financial hardship'' and the process
for deciding eligibility when they become available. 

Non-Federal contributions may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services.
Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal
Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions. 



Purpose 



The purpose of these awards is to establish a national program of cancer registries by supporting States in their efforts
to 
(Part I) enhance State cancer registries to become statewide, population-based, registries that meet minimum standards
of completeness, timeliness, and quality, and (Part II) plan and implement statewide, population-based cancer
registries where they do not currently exist. 

The national goals of this program are to rapidly establish and standardize the reporting of cancer among the States
in order to provide: (1) Timely feedback for evaluating progress toward achieving cancer-control objectives that
include the ``Healthy People 2000'' objectives; (2) data to identify cancer incidence variation for ethnic groups
and for regions within a State, between States, and between regions; (3) guidance for health resource allocation;
(4) data to evaluate State cancer-control activities; and (5) information to improve planning for future health
care needs.

Program Requirements



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities listed under B. (CDC Activities).



A. Recipient Activities



Recipients of funds under Part I are expected to support and enhance, and recipients under Part II are expected to plan,
implement, and support the operation of population-based, statewide cancer registries in order to collect data
concerning each form of invasive cancer with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and
each form of in-situ cancer except for carcinoma in-situ of the cervix uteri. Data on carcinoma in-situ of the cervix
uteri is not being collected at this time because it has been well documented that routine collection of such data is
incomplete due to inconsistent collection of other High Grade Neoplasia. In addition, these data are not comparable
over time because of changing terminology and diagnostic criteria. (Working Group on Pre-Invasive Cervical Neoplasia
and Population-Based Cancer Registries Final Subcommittee Report, April 1993.)

Data to be collected for invasive and in-situ cancers include:




1. Demographic information about each case of cancer including at a minimum:



(a) Last name, first name, middle initial.

(b) Address at diagnosis, including city, county, State, and zip code (or zip + 4 where available).

(c) Census tract.

(d) Race and Spanish/Hispanic origin.

(e) Sex.

(f) Birth date.

(g) Social security number.



2. Information on the industrial or occupational history of the individual with the cancers, to the extent such information
is available from the same record.

3. Administrative information, including at a minimum:



(a) Date of diagnosis.

(b) Date of admission.

(c) Source of information.



4. Pathological data characterizing the cancer, including at a minimum:



(a) Primary site.

<DOCTITLE>Fiber Size Classification and Measurement: Meeting</DOCTITLE>



The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) announces the following meeting.






Name:

 Fiber Size Classification and Measurement.



Time and Date:

 1 p.m.&hyph;3 p.m., June 7, 1994.



Place:

 Alice Hamilton Laboratory, Conference Room C, NIOSH, CDC, 5555 Ridge Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45213.



Status:

 Open to the public, limited only by the space available.



Purpose:

 The purpose is to conduct an open meeting for the peer review of a NIOSH project entitled ``Fiber Size Classification
and Measurement.'' This project concerns the evaluation and improvement of a fiber length classification instrument.

This instrument operates by dielectrophoresis, a process that creates a gradient electric field which aligns the
fibers and causes their migration toward a cylinder. Because the fibers migrate at a velocity which is proportional
to the square of their length (longer fibers migrate at a faster rate than shorter ones), the researcher can select
various lengths of fibers by manipulating the voltage that directs the migration of the fibers. The first part of the
project will involve improvement and evaluation of the instrument's operational parameters. Fibers classified
by length will subsequently be used in a variety of laboratory applications including: (1) Measurement of fiber deposition
in respiratory system using a lung model; (2) measurement of fiber penetration through respirator filters; and (3)
development of a size-selective fiber sampler for use in collecting personal breathing zone samples.

Viewpoints and suggestions from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited.



Contact Person for Additional Information:

 Paul A. Baron, Ph.D., NIOSH, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R7, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, telephone 513/841&hyph;4241.

Privacy Act of 1974; Notice of a Computer Matching Program





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration, (HUD).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a Computer Matching Program_HUD and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988, as amended, (Pub. L. 100&hyph;503), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Conduct
of Matching Programs (54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989)), and OMB Bulletin 89&hyph;22, ``Instructions on Reporting Computer
Matching Programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public,'' the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to conduct a recurring computer matching program
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to utilize a computer information system of HUD, the Credit Alert Interactive
Voice Response System (CAIVRS), with USDA's debtor files. In addition to HUD Data, the CAIVRS data base included delinquent
debt information from the Department of Education, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Small Business Administration.
This match will allow prescreening of applicants for loans or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government to ascertain
if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or insured by the Federal Government for HUD or USDA direct or
guaranteed loans.



Before granting a loan, the lending agency and/or the authorized lending institution will be able to interrogate
the CAIVRS debtor file which contains the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of HUD's delinquent debtors and defaulters
and defaulted debtor records of the USDA and verify that the loan applicant is not in default or delinquent on direct
or guaranteed loans of participating Federal programs of either agency. Authorized users place a telephone call
to the system. The system provides a recorded message followed by a series of instructions, one of which is a requirement
for the SSN of the loan applicant. The system then reports audibly whether the SSN is related to delinquent or defaulted
Federal obligations for HUD or USDA direct or guaranteed loans. As a result of the information produced by this match,
the authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision of any loan assistance to an applicant or take
other adverse action against such applicant, until an officer or employee of such agency has independently verified
such information.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2), copies of the matching agreement are being sent by HUD to both houses of Congress.
The match is expected to commence not sooner than 40 days after the agreement by the parties is submitted to Congress

REPORTING OF MATCHING PROGRAM: 

In accordance with Public Law 100&hyph;503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended,
and Office of Management and Budget Bulletin 89&hyph;22, ``Instructions on Reporting Computer Matching Programs
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public;'' copies of this Notice and report, in duplicate,
are being provided to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget.






Authority: 

The matching program may be conducted pursuant to Public Law 100&hyph;503, ``The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988,'' as amended, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;129 (Revised January 1993),
Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables. One of the purposes of all Executive departments and
agencies_including HUD_is to implement efficient management practices for Federal credit programs. OMB Circular
A&hyph;129 was issued under the authority of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended; the Budget and Accounting
Act of 1950, as amended; the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended; and, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, as amended.




OBJECTIVES TO BE MET BY THe MATCHING PROGRAM: 

The matching program will allow USDA access to a system which permits prescreening of applicants for loans or loans
guaranteed by the Federal Government to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or insured
by the Government. In addition, HUD will be provided access to USDA debtor data for prescreening purposes.




RECORDS TO BE MATCHED: 

HUD will utilize its system of records entitled HUD/DEPT&hyph;2, 

Accounting Records. 

The debtor files for HUD programs involved are included in this system of records. HUD's debtor files contain information
on borrowers and co-borrowers who are currently in default (at least 90 days delinquent on their loans); or who have
any outstanding claims paid during the last three years on Title II insured or guaranteed home mortgage loans; or individuals
who have defaulted on Section 312 rehabilitation loans; or individuals who have had a claim paid in the last three years
on a Title I loan. For the CAIVRS match, HUD/DEPT&hyph;2, System of Records, receives its program inputs form HUD/DEPT&hyph;28,
Property Improvement and Manufactured (Mobile) Home Loans_Default; HUD/DEPT&hyph;32, Delinquent/Default/Assigned
Temporary Mortgage Assistance Payments (TMAP) Program; and HUD/CPD&hyph;1, Rehabilitation Loans-Delinquent/Default.



The USDA will provide HUD with debtor files contained in its system of records entitled, Applicant/Borrower or Grantee
File (USDA/FNHA&hyph;1). HUD is maintaining USDA's records only as a ministerial action on behalf of USDA, not as
part of HUD's HUD/DEPT&hyph;2 system of records. USDA's data contain information on individuals who have defaulted
on their guaranteed loans. The USDA will retain ownership and responsibility for their system of records that they
place with HUD. HUD serves only as a record location and routine use recipient for USDA's data.




NOTICE PROCEDURES: 

HUD and the USDA will notify individuals at the time of application (ensuring that routine use appears on the application
form) for guaranteed or direct loans that their records will be matched to determine whether they are delinquent or
in default on a Federal debt. HUD and the USDA will also publish notices concerning routine use disclosures in the 

Federal Register

 to inform individuals that a computer match may be performed to determine a loan applicant's credit status with the
Federal Government.




CATEGORIES OF RECORDS/INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED: 

The debtor records include these data elements: SSN, claim number, program code, and indication of indebtedness.
Categories of records include: records of claims and defaults, repayment agreements, credit reports, financial
statements, and records of foreclosures. Categories of individuals include: former mortgagors and purchasers
of HUD-owned properties, manufactured (mobile) home and home improvement loan debtors who are delinquent or in default
on their loans, and rehabilitation loan debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans.




PERIOD OF THE MATCH: 

Matching is expected to begin 40 days after the date copies of the signed (by both Data Integrity Boards) computer matching
agreement are sent to both Houses of Congress or 30 days from the date this Notice is published in the 

Federal Register

 or 40 days from the date this notice is approved, whichever is later, providing no comments are received which would
result in a contrary determination.

Importation of Exotic Wild Birds to the United States; Implementation of the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



Action: 

Notice.

 


Summary:

 A recent district court order has declared invalid certain portions of the Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations
implementing the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). On March 29, 1994, District Judge Oberdorfer ruled that
50 CFR 15.11(b)(2) and the final sentence of &sect;15.11(c) [which were promulgated by the Service as part of the final
rule published on November 16, 1993, 58 FR 60524], violate the language of the WBCA because those regulatory sanctions
purported to exclude from the coverage of the automatic import moratorium those exotic birds listed on appendix III
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that did not originate in the country or countries
that listed them in appendix III. Therefore, in keeping with the district court order, the Service announces that
all exotic birds listed on CITES appendix III are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless
of their country of origin. Future rule-making notices will delete the regulatory provisions that were invalidated
by the court order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 23, 1992 the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include promoting
the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are
biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane
treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries
of origin. On November 16, 1993 the Service published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60524) which implemented the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provided permit requirements and procedures
for some allowed exemptions. This final rule finalized the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 12, 1993 (58 FR 42926) with some modifications based on comments received and further analysis by the Service.
This notice serves to announce that the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c)_Prohibitions, of the
final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1993. 


In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that appendix III species are considered CITES-listed
species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in appendix III.
The Service noted that the listing of a species in appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby
requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permits issuance requirements for that country only; when the
species is found in other countries that did not list it in appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating
that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found
in countries other than where listed in appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed
is only listed in the appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its
understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby appendix III species were subject
to the automatic import prohibitions of the law, if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would
be subject to the discretionary prohibitions of the law. 
The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife brought a civil action against the Secretary of the
Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging that part of &sect;15.11 which
restricts the importation of certain appendix III exotic birds. 

Humane Society of the United States 

v. 

Babbitt, 

Civ. No. 94&hyph;0296 (D.D.C., Mar. 29, 1994). A hearing in District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs
argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained
in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph
(b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that
has not listed the species in appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11 (b) (2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates
the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.

On March 29, 1994 U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. Therefore,
effective immediately, no birds listed in CITES appendix III can be imported into the United States unless they are
accompanied by an import permit or are on an approved list, pursuant to 50 CFR part 15. 
In a future notice, the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) consistent with the declaration in the
Court Order. The Service will propose that all exotic bird species listed in CITES appendix III (in addition to those
in I or II), wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless accompanied by an import permit issued pursuant
to subpart C of 50 CFR part 15 or are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994 the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule establishing those approved lists.

SUMMARY:

 Following receipt of a request on April 18, 1994, from the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Commission
instituted investigation No. 332&hyph;354, U.S. Schedule of Services Commitments, under section 332(g) of the
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)) for the purpose of compiling and maintaining the official U.S. Schedule of Services

 Information specific to the investigation may be obtained from Mr. Norman McLennan (202&hyph;205&hyph;3440) or

Mr. William Gearhart of the Commission's Office of the General Counsel (202&hyph;205&hyph;3091). Hearing impaired
individuals are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810.

 

BACKGROUND:

 In his letter the USTR requested that the Commission initiate an ongoing program to compile and maintain the United
States Schedule of Services Commitments. As stated in the letter, the establishment of such a schedule is required
by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), negotiated as part of the recently completed GATT Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade agreements. The GATS provides for the establishment of national schedules of commitments,
wherein signatory countries set forth their respective national commitments pertaining to specific service sectors.
These schedules bind countries to maintain a minimum level of market access and to a national treatment obligation.
In addition, GATS also provides for a broad most-favored-nation (MFN) obligation, unless nations provide a list
of exceptions for MFN treatment. The schedules and MFN exceptions provide the basis for efforts to further liberalize
international trade in services. 


The letter requested that the Commission (1) compile an initial U.S. Schedule reflecting the final services commitments
made in the Uruguay Round; and (2) work with USTR to update the U.S. Schedule, as necessary, to reflect all future commitments
resulting from the post-Uruguay Round negotiations on financial, telecommunication, and maritime services, and
future bilateral and multilateral services negotiations undertaken by USTR. The USTR requested that the Commission
compile an initial U.S. Schedule by January 1, 1995.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


William L. Algea, III, M.D.; Denial of Application



On February 24, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to William L. Algea, III, M.D. (Respondent), of Milligan, Tennessee, proposing
to deny his pending application for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The
Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that
term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) based on his dispensing and prescribing controlled substances for no legitimate medical
purpose on ten occasions between 1986 and 1989 to undercover agents who were posing as patients; his voluntary surrender
of his previous DEA certificate of Registration; the summary suspension of his medical license by the Board of Medical
Examiners of the State of Tennessee; and his conviction of four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) based on his
guilty plea in the United States District Court, Western District of Tennessee.

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d)
and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.

In 1986, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation obtained information that Respondent was issuing controlled substance
prescriptions for no legitimate medical purpose. Based upon this information, agents posing as patients made office
visits with Respondent in an attempt to procure illicit prescriptions. These visits corroborated the initial reports;
Respondent issued prescriptions for Talwin and Valium, both Schedule IV controlled substances, on the first undercover
visit and then issued two more prescriptions less then a month later for Pentobarbital, a Schedule III controlled
substance, and Talwin. None of these prescriptions were issued for a legitimate medical reason.

Other Tennessee law enforcement agencies also joined in the investigation. Between February of 1988 and April 1989,
Respondent dispensed or wrote prescriptions for Demerol, a Schedule II controlled substance, Valium and Talwin
for no legitimate medical purpose to these undercover agents on eight separate occasions. During some of these visits,
Respondent inquired about obtaining cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, from the agents. On the final visit,
the undercover agent gave Respondent one ounce of cocaine in exchange for $600.00 and a Talwin prescription.

Within a short time of the final undercover visit, Respondent was arrested and charged with four counts of violating
21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), based upon the latest undercover transactions. At this point Respondent voluntarily surrendered
his DEA Certificate of Registration, AA2050285. Then, on April 14, 1989, the Board of Medical Examiners of the State
of Tennessee summarily suspended Respondent's medical license. On May 20, 1990, Respondent pled guilty to and was
convicted of four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) in the United States District Court, Western District of
Tennessee. On July 15, 1992, the Board of Medical Examiners granted Respondent a restricted medical license with
the conditions that he be on probation for three years and that, 

inter alia

, he not be allowed to handle Schedule II controlled substances.

The Deputy Administrator may deny an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration if he determines that the registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``(i)n determining the public interest,
the following factors will be considered:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''

In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator
is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, the Deputy Administrator
has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances
of each case. See 

David E. Trawick, D.D.S.,

 53 FR 5326 (1988).

In this proceeding factors one through four apply. Factor one is applicable based upon the Tennessee Board of Medical
Examiner's summary suspension of Respondent's license and subsequent issuance of a restricted license. Factors
two and four apply because Respondent prescribed and dispensed controlled substances to undercover agents on many
occasions between 1986 and 1989 and based on the fact that Respondent traded a controlled substance prescription
for cocaine on the last undercover visit. Factor three is also applicable based upon Respondent's conviction in Federal
District Court to four counts of violating 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1).

No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator
concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that the application executed by William
L. Algea, III, M.D., on November 12, 1992, for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner, be, and it hereby
is, denied. This order is effective May 24, 1994.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;31]</RINDOCK>



<DOCTITLE>Steven W. Patwell, M.D.; Continuation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On January 28, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Steven W. Patwell, M.D., (Respondent), 866 Plumas Street, suite B, Yuba City,
California 95991. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BP0597508,
and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's
continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and
824(a)(4).
More specifically, the Order to Show Cause asserted that on November 7, 1990, a search warrant was executed at Respondent's
residence. During the execution of the warrant, police officers found one and one-half pounds of marijuana, trace
amounts of cocaine and methamphetamine, and assorted drug paraphernalia. The Order to Show Cause referred to Respondent's
February 15, 1991, plea in the Superior Court of California, County of Placer, of 

nolo contendere

 to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana. The Order to Show Cause further pointed to the action of the Division
of Medical Quality of the Medical Board of California (Board.) On June 22, 1992, the Board accepted a Stipulation in
Settlement staying revocation of Respondent's physician and surgeon certificate and placing said certificate
on probation for a period of five years.
Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the allegations raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter
was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. On August 18, 1993, a hearing was held in Sacramento,
California. On September 29, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his opinion, recommended ruling, findings
of fact and conclusions of law. Neither the Government nor Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling.
On October 29, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator.
Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.
Testimony provided at the hearing by a Roseville Police officer revealed that during the execution of a search warrant
at Respondent's residence, officers found 81 individually wrapped plastic baggies containing marijuana, approximately
one and one-half pounds in total. In addition, the officers found drug paraphernalia, including roach clips, pipes
and bongs, a green powder sifter containing trace amounts of cocaine, a small glass vial containing methamphetamine,
ephedrine tablets, an Ohaus triple beam scale, a grooved mirror with the image of a $100 bill which also contained trace
amounts of cocaine and assorted prescription bottles.
At the hearing, Mrs. Patwell testified that, with the exception of the prescription bottles, all of the contraband
found at the Patwell residence during execution of the search warrant belonged to her. She stated that she had had a
drug problem since age 14 but that she had been drug-free since November 1990. Mrs. Patwell further explained that
she packaged the marijuana in small plastic baggies in order to limit her daily consumption and hid her use of drugs
from her husband.
Respondent testified that he was not aware that his wife had been storing marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine
in their house. While he knew that his wife used marijuana, Respondent explained that he usually chose to ignore the
situation and chose not to confront his wife about her drug use. With respect to the Ohaus triple beam scale found in
his house, Respondent stated that he was a scale collector and that the scale was simply one of many scales in his collection.
According to Respondent, the prescription bottles found by the police were mistakenly brought home by him after patients
from the office gave them to him.
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Deputy Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration
or deny any application for registration if he determines that the continued registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation
of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience
in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record
under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances;
(4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other
conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
The Deputy Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application
should be denied or a registration revoked. See 

Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 

51 FR 17556 (1986); 

Anne L Hendricks, M.D., 

51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly noted that factors (4) and (5) were relevant to a determination
of whether Respondent's continued registration would be in the public interest.

<PARENT> FR940524-2-00041 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With respect to factor (4), the administrative law judge found that Respondent's 

nolo contendere

 plea to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana was not intended as an admission of guilt. Rather, the plea
was entered in an effort to resolve the case without submitting to the risks of litigation. The administrative law
judge found the explanations regarding the marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine of both Mrs. Patwell and Respondent
to be credible. With respect to the prescription bottles found in the Patwell residence, the administrative law judge
noted that such storage was in violation of DEA regulations. The administrative law judge, however, found convincing
Respondent's explanation and concluded that the violation was inadvertent.
Turning his attention to factor (5), the administrative law judge noted that regardless of Respondent's lack of wrongdoing
with respect to the marijuana, the fact remains that approximately one and one-half pounds of marijuana were found
in his home, as were trace amounts of other drugs and drug paraphernalia. The administrative law judge commented that
greater diligence on the part of Respondent should be expected. Consequently, the administrative law judge recommended
that three conditions be applied to the continuation of Respondent's registration. First, Respondent shall not
allow any controlled substances, other than those prescribed by a doctor other than Respondent for a legitimate medical
need, to be kept in his home. Second, Respondent must report to the local DEA office and appropriate law enforcement
authorities any illegal use of controlled substances by any individual. Third, Respondent must report to the local
DEA office and appropriate law enforcement authorities any controlled substances, except those prescribed by a
doctor for a legitimate medical need, found in his home. The Deputy Administrator agrees with the administrative
law judge that Respondent's registration should not be revoked and adopts his findings of fact, conclusions of law,
and recommended ruling in its entirety.
While the Deputy Administrator finds the recommendation of the administrative law judge to be appropriate, this
decision should in no way be interpreted as an endorsement of the past behavior of either Mrs. Patwell or Respondent.
Respondent's testimony indicates that he recognizes that his failure to take action in the face of his wife's drug
abuse was both unprofessional and unacceptable. Respondent's remorse for his past inaction and his apparent commitment
to a more responsible future lead to the conclusion that revocation would not be appropriate.
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that Steven W. Patwell, M.D.'s DEA Certificate
of Registration, BP0597508, be, and it hereby is, continued. This order is effective May 24, 1994.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;41]</RINDOCK>




<DOCTITLE>David L. Trent, M.D; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>



On March 22, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to David L. Trent, M.D., 12013 Surrey Lane, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
73099. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Dr. Trent's (Respondent) DEA Certificate of Registration, AT8064379,
and deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner for reason that Respondent's continued registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4) and 823(f). The Order to Show
Cause alleged that between 1989 and 1992, Respondent prescribed numerous controlled substances to at least two individuals,
including an undercover officer, for no legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of professional practice.

On April 30, 1993, Respondent filed a request for hearing on the matters raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter
was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following the submission of the parties' prehearing
statements, a hearing date was set for September 22, 1993. On September 14, 1993, the Government filed a motion for
summary disposition based on the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control's (OBNDDC) September
13, 1993, order revoking Respondent's state license to handle controlled substances.

The OBNDDC order, attached to the Government's motion, referred to an Oklahoma Medical Board (Board) complaint that
alleged that in January 1992, Respondent issued two prescriptions for controlled dangerous substances to an undercover
agent. According to the Board's complaint, Respondent issued the prescriptions without sufficient examination,
without the establishment of a valid physician-patient relationship and without medical need.

The Board complaint further asserted that during 1991 and 1992, Respondent prescribed, administered and dispensed
controlled dangerous substances to other patients without sufficient examination, without establishing a valid
physician-patient relationship and without medical need. Following a show cause hearing on June 3, 1993, the hearing
officer recommended that Respondent's authority to handle controlled substances be revoked. This recommendation
was adopted by OBNDDC order dated September 13, 1993.

On September 27, 1993, Respondent answered the Government's motion and requested that the DEA proceedings be stayed
or that the hearing date be rescheduled. On October 6, 1993, the administrative law judge issued an order granting
the Government's motion for summary disposition and denying Respondent's request for a stay or rescheduling of the
proceedings.

No exceptions were filed and on January 18, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting
Administrator. The Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67.

It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized
to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business. See 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The DEA Administrators
have consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled substances cannot
be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration. See Ramon Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); George S. Heath,
M.D., 51 FR 26610 (1986); and Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., 51 FR 23481 (1986).

Consequently, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration concludes
that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked based on his lack of authorization to handle
controlled substances in the State of Oklahoma. The Deputy Administrator has determined that in light of Respondent's
lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, it is not necessary to address whether Respondent's
continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AT8064379,
issued to David L. Trent, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration be,
and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective June 23, 1994.

Petitions for Modification 



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 



1. Southern Utah Fuel 



[Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;57&hyph;C] 



Southern Utah Fuel Company, 397 South, 800 West, Salina, Utah 84654 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364 (b)(4) and (c)(3) (weekly examination) to its SUFCO Mine (I.D. No. 42&hyph;00089) located in Sevier
County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to establish an evaluation point to monitor the air quality where the bleeder
connector connects with the North Mains return entries on a weekly basis; and to prohibit travel in the affected area.
The petitioner states that due to the inability of maintaining the oxygen content at 19.5 percent in the 4th East Bleeder
Connector because the air is ventilating the longwall gob area, the seals located along the bleeder connector cannot
be examined safely and that to increase the air through the gob area would increase the possibility of spontaneous
combustion in the gob. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



2. Costain Coal, Inc. 



[Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;58&hyph;C] 



Costain Coal Company, P.O. Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.1002 (location of trolley wires; trolley feeder wires, high-voltage cables and transformers) to its Baker Mine
(I.D. No. 15&hyph;14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky. Due to the width and required production, motor horsepower
will be necessary that requires the use of high-voltage for longwall equipment in the Kentucky No. 13 seam at the mine.
The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage (2400 volts) operated equipment in by the last open crosscut at the working
longwall sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



3. Black Dog Coal Corporation 



[Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;59&hyph;C] 



Black Dog Coal Corporation, Route 1, Box 105&hyph;A, Haysi, Virginia 24256 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its No. 1 (I.D. No. 44&hyph;05770) located in Buchanan County, Virginia.
The petitioner proposes to check the quality and quantity of the ventilating current where it enters the intake entry
located to the left of the 

#

3 conveyor at Spad Station 

#

1022 and where it leaves sub-normal roof conditions at Spad Station 

#

1211; and to travel into the intake airway at each door in the brattice line (located at 300 feet intervals) to look up
and down the airway as far as possible to visually inspect the airway in order to evaluate the ventilation current without
exposing the examiner to unnecessary danger. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would
provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



4. Frontier-Kemper Constructors, Inc. 



[Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;28&hyph;M] 



Frontier-Kemper Constructors, Inc., P.O. Box 726, San Manuel, Arizona 85631 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 57.9360(a) (shelter holes) for its development contract work at Magma Copper Company's San Manuel Mine (I.D.
No. 02&hyph;00151, AO&hyph;1) located in Pinal County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes to cut 34,500 lineal feet
of circular shaped drift, 15 feet in diameter, using a Tunnel Boring Machine, 3440 vertical feet underground. The
petitioner states that the haulage roadway is rail mounted and consists of a 36 inch gauge track, using 70 pound rail
and 65 inch wide Brookville Diesel Locomotives pulling Mullenhauser side dump cars; that the shelter holes would
be installed at 200 feet centers in accordance with Az. 27&hyph;345 as a new mandatory policy for the petitioner; and
that the shelter holes would not be used for storage. The petitioner proposes to provide training consisting of thorough-on-site
instruction by petitioner's personnel on the use of shelter holes when trains are in the drift; to conduct discussions
regarding the reason this policy is being implemented; to distribute written notice of the new policy and the fact
that disciplinary action may be taken when the new policy is not followed; to incorporate the new policy into petitioner's
written policies and procedures manual; to provide annual refresher training and task training to new employees
on the use of the platform shelters (shelter holes); and to post signs throughout the drift instructing the miners
to use the platform shelters (shelter holes) when trains are moving in the drift. The petitioner states that application
of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to its personnel. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the
proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.




Request for Comments 



Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments. These comments must be filed with the Office
of Standards, Regulations and Variances, Mine Safety and Health Administration, room 627, 4015 Wilson Boulevard,
Arlington, Virginia 22203. All comments must be postmarked or received in that office on or before June 23, 1994. Copies
of these petitions are available for inspection at that address.

On July 12, presentations will focus on mobilization and migration of radionuclides. Specific topics include solubility,
speciation, and sorption aspects of radionuclides; origin, movement, and retardation of colloids; pneumatic movement
of radionuclides; and the potential effects of thermal loading and engineered barriers on migration transport.
In addition, time has been set aside to discuss the status of Scenario A and how it could affect the technical and scientific
program. The day will end with a round-table discussion of the information presented during the day.

On July 13, the majority of the presentations will concern transportation of spent nuclear fuel, including transportation
planning and the Department of Energy's (DOE) institutional program, updates on projects such as the Cask System
Development Program, and perspectives of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Association of American
Railroads. Time has also been reserved for an update from the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator.

The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was created by Congress in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987
to evaluate the technical and scientific validity of activities undertaken by the DOE in its program to manage the
disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste. In that same legislation, Congress directed
the DOE to characterize a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for its suitability as a potential location for a permanent
repository for the disposal of that waste.

Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria
Reich, Board librarian, beginning August 24, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs,

Policy Letter on Management Oversight of Service Contracting



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal Procurement Policy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) is reissuing Policy Letter 93&hyph;1 on the ``Management Oversight
of Service Contracting.'' The Policy Letter includes appropriate changes from proposed Supplement No. 1 which was
issued on January 26, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4955).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OFPP Policy Letter 93&hyph;1, ``Management Oversight of Service Contracting,'' was signed by the former OFPP Administrator
on November 19, 1993 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 2, 1993 (58 Fed. Reg. 63593). The Policy Letter is being reissued in its entirety to replace the November
19, 1993 version.




The Policy Letter is being reissued to provide agencies with a more ``results-oriented'' approach to managing and
administering service contracts through the ``best practices'' concept. One way to achieve excellence in contractor
performance is to improve the acquisition, management, and administration of service contracts. OFPP has several
initiatives underway that should help to achieve excellence in contractor performance, e.g., emphasizing past
performance in source selection, stressing the need for more performance-based service contracts, and developing
best practices in contract administration. This Policy Letter provides guiding principles through the ``best practices''
concept that should help agencies develop, analyze, and perfect requirements for service contracts which, in turn,
should improve contract management and administration. Other ``best practices'' models in contract management
and administration will be issued as separate guidance.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposed Supplement No. 1 and requests for comments was published in the February 2, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4955). Twenty-one comment letters were received in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice, of which, one was from the private sector. A summary of the more significant comments received and OFPP response
to them follows:



1. Best practices in Lieu of Mandated Written Management Control Procedures and a Single Management Official



Several Inspectors General (IGs) commented that changing to the ``best practices'' concept will not promote the
improvements that are needed in managing and administering service contracts. The commenters suggested that eliminating
the requirement for management control procedures and the single management official will increase the vulnerability
of the procurement system to waste, fraud, and abuse.

Traditionally, OFPP has taken an ``input-oriented'' approach to managing and administering service contracts
to respond to concerns raised in Congressional hearings and reports that better controls are needed to prevent abuses
from occurring in the acquisition and use of service contracts. We believe that this input-oriented approach, i.e.,
developing procedures, designating a single official, and adding reporting requirements, has not added significant
value to management practices being used in the federal government. Hence, we believe that a more ``results-oriented''
approach that suggests best practices that add value in contract management and administration should help to streamline
the procurement process and achieve excellence in contractor performance.

Therefore, the proposed revisions in Supplement No. 1 to section 8 (Responsibilities) has been incorporated in this
reissued Policy Letter. We have included a definition of ``best practices'' to clarify our intent of this concept.



2. Use of Best Practices as Mandatory Guidance for Audit Purposes




Several IGs expressed concern that they are unable to use ``best practices'' as mandatory regulatory guidance for
audit purposes. OFPP believes that the guidelines in section 7 and the questions in appendix A should be viewed as warning
signals to help agencies analyze and perfect requirements for service contracts to prevent abuses from occurring.
As we continue to work with the agencies and industry to develop ``best practices'' in contract management and administration
agencies should be able to use these guiding principles to make improvements that add value to the procurement system.
In keeping with the principles of the National Performance Review, we believe that the IGs should work with the procurement
community to help achieve needed improvements in service contracting.

Therefore, the proposed changes to section 8(d) in Supplement No. 1 will be incorporated in this reissued Policy Letter.

3. Exclusion of Interagency Acquisitions Under the Economy Act



Several commenters raised concern about excluding interagency agreements from coverage of the Policy Letter in
view of the problems identified in the recent hearings on contract offloading. Other commenters suggested that the
exclusion should be clarified since an interagency agreement under the Economy Act can be used to obtain either in-house
support from another agency or to obtain support from a contract sponsored by another government organization.

OFPP's intent was to exclude interagency agreements where the support service is being provided by in-house government
employees. Interagency acquisitions under the Economy Act where the servicing agency contracts out for the support
are covered by the Policy Letter. In developing the requirement for the interagency agreement, the requesting and
servicing agencies should ensure that the principles outlined in the Policy Letter are being followed.

Section 5 (Exclusions) has been revised to make clear that only interagency acquisitions/agreements where support
is provided by in-house government employees are excluded from coverage of the Policy Letter.



4. Other Exclusions



One agency suggested that the coverage of the Policy Letter was too broad which creates an enormous administrative
burden without a demonstrated need. The agency suggested that such services as ADP and telecommunications, training,
medical services, or those that do not affect government decisionmaking, support or influence agency policy development,
or affect program design and implementation should be excluded. In addition it was suggested that research and development
(R&amp;D) should be excluded since contracts for R&amp;D are inherently different from service contracts. The concern
is that many of the questions may be misapplied to R&amp;D contracts since the very nature of the work is very broad and
imprecise.

OFPP disagrees with excluding the other suggested services since they may be susceptible to abuse in those problem
areas identified in the Policy Letter. Prior GAO reports, the SWAT Report on Civilian Agency Contracting, and the
Director's recent services contract review revealed that services contracting practices are uneven across the
Executive Branch and that various contract management problems should be addressed.

We understand that a distinction can be made between R&amp;D and service contracts. Moreover, some of the questions
may not be appropriate for R&amp;D because of the technical and scientific nature of the work. We believe, however,
that R&amp;D contracts may be susceptible to the problem areas identified in the Policy Letter and should not be excluded.
We have included a statement in the second introductory paragraph in section 7 to recognize that R&amp;D, as well as
architect and engineering services, are specialized categories of contracting. Agencies should also ensure that
they are in compliance with applicable FAR guidance pertaining to those categories when using the guiding principles
in the Policy Letter.

As part of the National Performance Review, the procurement reform legislation includes a provision to increase
the small purchase threshold to $100,000. This would significantly reduce the number of service contracts subject
to the Policy Letter because the Letter does not apply to contracts below the small purchase threshold. Moreover,
we believe that the questions in appendix A are good guiding principles that should help agencies better structure
their requirements for all services so that excellence in contractor performance is achieved.

Policy Letter No. 93&hyph;1 [Reissued]
To the Heads of Executive Departments and Establishments
Subject: Management Oversight of Service Contracting


May 18, 1994.



1. Purpose



This Policy Letter establishes Government-wide policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides guiding principles
for Executive Departments and agencies in managing the acquisition and use of services.



2. Authority



This Policy Letter is issued pursuant to section 6(a) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act, as amended,
codified at 41 U.S.C. Section 405.



3. Background



On March 15, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Leon Panetta requested that 17 major Executive
Departments and agencies review their service contracting programs. The purpose of the review was to determine (1)
if the service contracts were accomplishing what was intended; (2) whether the contracts were cost effective; and
(3) whether inherently governmental functions were being performed by contractors. The results of the reviews indicated
that service contracting practices and capabilities are uneven across the Executive branch and that various common
management problems need to be addressed.

In addition to the Director's review, the National Performance Review has found that improved support for customers
of the procurement system is needed. To do this it is important that procurement officials work closely with program
and other officials to develop clear and precise statements of work for the products and services being acquired.
Contracting for services is especially complex and demands close collaboration between procurement personnel
and the users of the service to ensure that contractor performance meets contract requirements and performance standards.

This Policy Letter_which includes appropriate changes from Supplement No. 1 [59 FR 4955 (1994)]_has been revised
to provide agencies with a more results-oriented approach to managing and administering service contracts through
the ``best practices'' concept. One way to achieve excellence in contractor performance is to improve the acquisition,
management, and administration of service contracts. This Policy Letter provides guiding principles through the
``best practices'' concept that should help agencies develop, analyze, and perfect requirements for service contracts
which, in turn, should help to improve contract management and administration. Other ``best practices'' models
in contract management and administration will be issued as separate guidance.

The guidance contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;120, ``Guidelines for the
Use of Advisory and Assistance Services,'' has been rescinded by Transmittal Memorandum No. 1, [58 FR 63593 (1993)
and 59 FR 789 (1994)].



4. Definition



The following definitions are applicable to the Policy Letter:

a. 

Services

 are identifiable tasks to be performed, rather than the delivery of an end item of supply. For purposes of this Policy
Letter, only services obtained under nonpersonal services contracts are covered.

b. 

Best Practices.

 For purposes of this Policy Letter, best practices are techniques that agencies may use to help detect problems in
the acquisition, management, and administration of service contracts. Best practices are practical techniques
gained from experience that agencies may use to improve the procurement process.



5. Exclusions



Excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter are services that are (1) obtained through personnel appointments and
advisory committees, (2) obtained through personal services contracts authorized by statute, (3) for construction,
as defined in &sect;36.102 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), or (4) obtained through interagency agreements
where the work is being performed by in-house federal employees.

Also excluded from coverage of this Policy Letter are services obtained under contracts below the small purchase
threshold, and services incidental to supply contracts. However, agencies should ensure that they are in compliance
with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting and use good management practices and contract
administration techniques when using these contracting methods to obtain services.

6. Policy


When contracting for services, it is the policy of the Federal Government that:
a. Program officials are responsible for accurately describing the need to be filled or problem to be resolved through
service contracting to assure full understanding and responsive performance by contractors, and should obtain
assistance from contracting officials, as needed.
b. Services are to be obtained and used in ways that ensure that the Government retains inherently governmental decision-making
authority.
c. Services are to be obtained in the most cost-effective manner, without barriers to full and open competition, and
free of any potential conflicts of interest.
d. Sufficient trained and experienced officials are available within the agency to manage and oversee the contract
administration function.
e. Effective management practices are used to implement the guiding principles contained herein to prevent waste,
fraud, and abuse in services contracting.


7. Good Management Practices


While effective management oversight is required for all types of service contracts, some require less oversight
than others, as, for example, such routine services as lawn mowing and food preparation. Conversely, services that
tend to affect Government decision-making, support or influence policy development, or affect program management
are more susceptible to abuse. These, therefore, require a greater level of scrutiny.
The following sections offer guidance to ensure that good management practices are being followed. Agencies should
involve procurement and program officials when developing requirements for service contracts. Appendix A contains
a series of questions to help analyze and perfect service contract requirements within these guidelines. If the below
guidelines apply, and if the response to any of the questions listed in the appendix is affirmative, agencies should
ensure that they are in compliance with appropriate OFPP Policy Letters applicable to service contracting, and use
good management practices and contract administration techniques. Agencies should also continue to comply with
the FAR guidance for specialized categories of contracting such as research and development (part 35) and architect
and engineering (part 36) as they use the guidance in this Policy Letter.


a. Inherently Governmental Functions


When contracting for services, agencies must ensure that any final agency action reflects the informed, independent
judgment of agency officials. Contractors thus must not be allowed to perform inherently Governmental functions
as defined in OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental Functions (57 FR 45096 (1992)).


b. Cost Effectiveness


When a valid requirement exists, agency officials must ensure that the requirement is obtained in the most cost-effective
manner. If contractor support is deemed appropriate, agencies should ensure that their acquisition strategy will
result in the acquisition of services from a quality vendor that constitute the best value considering costs and other
relevant factors, and yield the greatest benefit to the Government.


c. Control


When contracting for services, in particular for highly specialized or technical services, agencies should ensure
that a sufficient number of trained and experienced officials is available within the agency to manage and oversee
the contract administration function. This especially applies to such services as management and professional
support, studies, analyses, and evaluations, and engineering and technical support. Agency officials need to be
able to make sound judgements on what the requirements should be, the estimated costs, and whether the contractor
is performing according to the contract terms and conditions. Agency officials must retain control over, and remain
accountable for, policy decisions that may be based, in part, on a contractor's performance and work products. Agency
officials must also provide an enhanced degree of management controls and oversight when contracting for functions
that closely support the performance of inherently Governmental functions.


d. Conflicts of Interest


Agency officials must ensure that any actual or potential conflicts of interest are identified and that appropriate
steps are taken to avoid, neutralized, or mitigate them. Service contracts are not to be awarded to any individual
or organization that is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial advice or assistance to the Government,
or that has an unfair competitive advantage over competing contractors unless every effort is first taken to mitigate
such conflict or advantage. OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants,
54 FR 51805 (1989) and FAR subpart 9.5 provide detailed guidance on conflicts of interest.


e. Competition


Full and open competition will assure cost effectiveness and reduce the potential for favoritism and conflict of
interest. To maximize competition, the Competition in Contracting Act requires thorough acquisition planning
and limits exceptions. The Act provides that lack of advance planning is not adequate justification for sole source
contracting. Any justification for a noncompetitive contract should provide a detailed explanation as to why competition
cannot be achieved. Plans should be made to minimize the number of subsequent noncompetitive awards.

8. Responsibilities



a. Heads of Agencies



Agency head (or their designees should ensure that:

(1) Requirements for servicers are clearly defined and appropriate performance standards are developed so that
contractor performance meets contract terms and conditions.

(2) Service contracts are awarded and administered in such a manner that will provide the customer is goods and services
of significant quality, on time and within budget.

(3) Specific procedures are in place when contracting for services to assure compliance with OFPP Policy Letters
92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental Functions (57 FR 45096 (1992), 91&hyph;2, Service Contracting (56 FR 15110
(1991), and 89&hyph;1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants, 54 FR 51805 (1989).

(4) Implementation strategies are developed and necessary staff training is initiated to assure effective implementation
of these policies.



b. Contracting Officials



Contracting officials should ensure that ``best practice'' techniques, such as those set forth below, are used when
contracting for services:

(1) The corporate experience section of an offeror's proposal should be reviewed to detect conflicts of interest.
Usually, the corporate experience section contains the contractor's prior business clients.

(2) Monthly progress reports should be reviewed to detect whether the contractor may be performing inherently governmental
functions.

Contracting officials should also seek other best practices techniques in contract management and administration
that may be used within their own contracting activities or other agencies that will help to achieve excellence in
contractor performance.

OFPP will also be working to develop governmentwide ``best practices'' models in contract administration which
will be issued as separate guidance.



c. Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council



Pursuant to sections 6(a) and 25(f) of the OFPP Act, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 401 

et seq.

, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall ensure that the policies established herein are incorporated
in the FAR within 210 days from the date this Policy Letter is published in the 

Federal Register

. The 210 day period is considered a ``timely manner'' as prescribed in 41 U.S.C. 405(b).



d. Inspectors General



The Inspectors General are encouraged to conduct vulnerability assessments of service contracting and, where warranted,
include in their annual plans a review of service contracts to ensure compliance with this Policy Letter.

The guidance in section 7 which refers to the questions in appendix A, or any resulting ``best practices'' models developed
by OFPP should not be viewed as mandatory regulatory guidance for audit purposes.



9. Judicial Review



This Policy letter is not intended to provide a constitutional or statutory interpretation of any kind and it is not
intended, and should be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law
by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person. It is intended only to provide policy
guidance to agencies in the exercise of their discretion concerning Federal contracting. Thus, this Policy Letter
is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any substantive or procedural basis on which to challenge any
agency action or inaction on the ground that such action or inaction was not in accordance with this Policy Letter.



10. Information Contract



For information regarding this Policy Letter contact Linda G. Williams, Deputy Associate Administrator, Office
of Federal Procurement Policy, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC, 20503. Telephone (202) 395&hyph;3302.



11. Effective Date



This Policy Letter is effective 30 days after the date of issuance. While these policies must be implemented in the
FAR, it is expected that agencies will take all appropriate actions in the interim to develop implementation strategies
and initiate staff training, consistent with section 8a(4), to ensure effective implementation of these policies.

Appendix A



The following is a series of questions to help agencies analyze and review requirements for service contracts.



A. Inherently Governmental Functions



If the response to the first question is affirmative, the contract requirement is for an inherently Governmental
function that must be performed by Government officials; if the response to the second question is affirmative, the
contract requirement may be for an inherently governmental function:

(1) Is the requirement for a function that is listed in appendix A of OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental
Functions?

(2) If the function is not listed in appendix A, do any of the factors in the ``totality of the circumstances'' analysis
discussed in section 7(b) of Policy Letter 92&hyph;1 indicate that the function may be inherently governmental?



B. Cost Effectiveness



If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, the agency may not have a valid requirement or not
be obtaining the requirement in the most cost effective manner:

(1) Is the statement of work so broadly written that it does not support the need for a specific service?

(2) Is the statement of work so broadly written that it does not permit adequate evaluation of contractor versus in-house
cost and performance?

(3) Is the choice of contract type, quality assurance plan, competition strategy, or other related acquisition strategies
and procedures in the acquisition plan inappropriate to ensure good contractor performance to meet the user's needs?

(4) If a cost reimbursement contract is contemplated, is the acquisition plan inadequate to address the proper type
of cost reimbursement to ensure that the contractor will have the incentive to control costs under the contract?

(5) Is the acquisition plan inadequate to address the cost effectiveness of using contractor support (either long-term
or short-term) versus in-house performance?

(6) Is the cost estimate, or other supporting cost information, inadequate to enable the contracting office to effectively
determine whether costs are reasonable?

(7) Is the statement of work inadequate to describe the requirement in terms of ``what'' is to be performed as opposed
to ``how'' the work is to be accomplished?

(8) Is the acquisition plan inadequate to ensure that there is proper consideration given to ``quality'' and ``best
value''?



C. Control



If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, there may be a control problem:

(1) Are there insufficient resources to evaluate contractor performance when the statement of work requires the
contractor to provide advice, analysis and evaluation, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations that could
significantly influence agency policy development or decision-making?

(2) Is the quality assurance plan too general to monitor adequately contractor performance?

(3) Is the statement of work so broadly written that it does not specify a contract deliverable or require progress
reporting on contractor performance?

(4) Is there concern that the agency lacks the expertise to evaluate independently the contractor's approach, methodology,
results, options, conclusions, or recommendations?

(5) Is the requirement for a function or service listed in appendix B of OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, or similar to
a function or service on that list, such that greater management scrutiny is required of the contract terms and the
manner of its performance?



D. Conflicts of Interests



If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, there may be a conflict of interests:

(1) Can the potential offeror perform under the contract in such a way as to devise solutions or make recommendations
that would influence the award of future contracts to that contractor?

(2) If the requirement is for support services (such as system engineering or technical direction), were any of the
potential offerors involved in developing the system design specifications or in the production of the system?

(3) Has the potential offeror participated in earlier work involving the same program or activity that is the subject
of the present contract wherein the offeror had access to source selection or proprietary information not available
to other offerors competing for the contract?

(4) Will the contractor be evaluating a competitor's work?

(5) Does the contract allow the contractor to accept its own products or activities on behalf of the Government?

(6) Will the work, under this contract, put the contractor in a position to influence Government decision-making,
e.g., developing regulations, that will affect the contractor's current or future business?

(7) Will the work under this contract affect the interests of the contractor's other clients?

(8) Are any of the potential offerors, or their personnel who will perform the contract, former agency officials who_while
employed by the agency_personally ad substantially participated in (a) the development of the requirement for,
or (b) the procurement of, these services within the past two years?



E. Competition



If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, completion may be unnecessarily limited:

(1) Is the statement of work narrowly defined with overly restrictive specifications or performance standards?

(2) Is the contract formulated in such a way as to create a continuous and dependent arrangement with the same contractor?

(3) Is the use of an indefinite quantity or term contract arrangement inappropriate to obtain the required services?

(4) Will the requirement be obtained through the use of other than full and open competition?

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Boston
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Interpretation to the BEACON Liability Rule



May 18, 1994.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 22, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested person.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange has agreed to an additional 60-day period for abrogation of the instant proposed rule change to begin
on such date as the proposed Competing Specialist Initiative (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;12) may be approved.

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The Boston Stock Exchange seeks to amend its BEACON Liability Rule through the adoption of an interpretation relating
to competing specialists. Specifically, the Rule will be supplemented by the following provision: 



.01&blank;In the event that there are two or more specialists competing in a given stock, the specialist to whom an
order is directed (if it appears on the BEACON System's Member Firm Interface Safe-Store File) will be responsible
for that order.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide an interpretation to Chapter XXXIII, section 7 of the Rules of
the Exchange regarding BEACON liability to clarify the impact of the Competing Specialist Initiative, which is pending
approval before the Commission, on the liability rule.


2. Statutory Basis




The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is section 6(b)(5) in that the rule is designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a
national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed to permit
unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change to
Adopt Functional Separation Procedures (``Chinese Wall'') for Specialist Firms Affiliated with an Approved Person</DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.



I. Introduction



On September 20, 1993 the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to adopt a set of procedures addressing specialist member organizations affiliated with an
approved person.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988).


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991).

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33090 (October 22, 1993),
58 FR 58206 (October 29, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal.



II. Description



The proposed rule change consists of Exchange guidelines that outline the minimum requirements that an Exchange
specialist firm affiliated with an approved person
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 will be expected to demonstrate to provide for a functional separation (``Chinese Wall'') of its specialist activity
from its retail and proprietary business.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
The Proposal defines the term ``approved person'' to mean a person who is not a member or allied member of the Exchange
or an employee of a member organization, who has become an approved person as provided in the rules of the Exchange and
who is either: (1) A person who controls a member or a member organization; or (ii) a person engaged in a securities or
kindred business who is controlled by or under common control with a member or member organization.

</FOOTNOTE>


In addition to requiring approved persons to establish a Chinese Wall, the proposal also requires that they establish,
maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information.
Finally, the proposal requires an approved person to obtain prior
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 written approval of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements to establish functional separation as
appropriate to its operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance
of the functional separation.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
4

</FOOTNAME>
Current Exchange upstairs firms will be given a grace period of ninety days to come into compliance; those seeking
to participate in the Competing Specialist pilot, however, must demonstrate compliance prior to approval. Thereafter,
compliance must be demonstrated to the Exchange before the applicant specialist firm may function as a specialist
on the floor of the Exchange. Conversation between Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, Boston Stock Exchange,
and N. Amy Bilbija, Commission, on March 15, 1994.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
5

</FOOTNAME>
In addition, a copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange Surveillance
Department.

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposal identifies certain minimum procedural and maintenance requirements. First the specialist's book
must be kept confidential. Second, the approved person can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions.
Third, material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the approved person from the issuer may
not be made available to the specialist. Fourth, clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist
may be routed only to employees engaged in such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of
the approved persons and specialist entities.

In addition, the proposal places limitations on the information which may pass between a broker affiliated with an
associated approved person and the specialist, such that they are limited to that exchange of information which would
occur in the normal course of business with a comparable unaffiliated individual. Thus, the broker may make available
to the specialist only the market information he would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal
course of his trading and ``market probing'' activity. The specialist may divulge to the broker only the information
about market conditions in specialty stocks that he would make available in the normal course of specializing to any
other broker, and in the same manner. The specialist, however, is further restricted in that he may provide market
information to the broker only upon request of that broker and not on his own initiative.

The proposal permits an approved person to popularize
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>
``Popularizing'' generally refers to the practice by specialists, their member organizations and their corporate
parents, of making recommendations and providing research coverage regarding their specialty securities. See
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23768, (November 3, 1986) 51 FR 41183 (November 13, 1986) (``NYSE/Amex Order'').

</FOOTNOTE>


In addition, the proposal provides specific procedures that will apply if a specialist becomes privy to material
non-public information. In such a case, the specialist must promptly inform his firm's compliance officer, or other
designated official, of such communication and seek guidance from such officer or official as to what procedures
he should subsequently follow. Such officer or official must maintain appropriate records, including the action
taken and a summary of the information received by the specialist. If the specialist is required to give up the ``book,''
then such transfer must be done in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the information,
and the Exchange must be informed.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>
The compliance officer is also required to keep a record of the time the specialist reacquired the book, reflecting
acknowledgement by the compliance officer that the reacquisition was appropriate.

</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, with respect to compliance, the Exchange will periodically examine the Chinese Wall procedures established
hereunder and will conduct surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an approved person and its affiliated
specialist member organization. The Exchange will monitor specifically the trading activities of approved persons
and affiliated specialists in the specialist firm's specialty stock in order to monitor the possible trading while
in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison reports generated
by the Exchange.



III. Discussion



The Commission recognizes that significant conflicts of interest can arise between an approved person and the affiliated
specialist unit which, if not addressed by appropriate Chinese Wall procedures and the monitoring and surveillance
of the continuing adequacy of such procedures, could result in potential manipulative market activity and informational
advantages benefitting the approved person, specialist unit, or the customers of either, all in contravention of
section 6(b) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission further believes that the procedures the Exchange intends to implement with respect to approving
and monitoring the Chinese Wall address these concerns, and therefore are consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Commission
believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general,
to protect investors and the public, in that the Chinese Wall is designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public
information by specialist units affiliated with an approved person. Further, the Commission believes the proposal
is consistent with the section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) Congressional finding
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 in that it aids in assuring fair competition among brokers and dealers.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission initially addressed the necessity and viability of Chinese Walls in approving the amendments to New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') Rules 98 and 193 respectively, which created
the present Chinese Wall scheme in effect today on those exchanges.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 At that time, the Commission expressed its belief that it is also desirable for the regional exchanges to consider
requiring specialists affiliated with integrated firms to establish an adequate Chinese Wall and generally to review
the efficacy of their surveillance and compliance procedures regarding those specialists. The Commission previously
had recognized the use of Chinese Walls in a number of instances regarding the establishment of an organizational
separation between different departments of a broker-dealer as one of several means of preventing the interdepartmental
communication of material, non-public information.

the necessity of segregating information flows arising from a business relationship with a company as distinct from
information received in an investor or shareholder capacity.''

The NYSE/Amex Order noted that, for example, in view of the diverse functions performed by a multi-service firm and
the material non-public information that may be obtained by any one department of the firm, the firm often may be required
to restrict access to information the department receiving it, in order to avoid potential liability under sections
10(b) and 14(e) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 and Rules 10b&hyph;5 and 14e&hyph;3 thereunder. Moreover, two years after approval of the Amex's NYSE's Chinese
Wall procedures, Congress enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''),
designed primarily to prevent, deter and prosecute insider trading.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Among other provisions ITSFEA created a specific requirement for broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed
to prevent the misuse of material non-public information.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In response to the promulgation thereof, many firms redrafted their internal Chinese Wall Procedures to ensure compliance.

Several SRO's (Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Pacific Stock Exchange) have adopted
the substance of the ITSFEA procedures under their rules applicable to members an member firms (See Securities Exchange
Release Nos. 30122 (December 30, 1992), 57 FR 729 (January 8, 1992); 30557 (April 6, 1992), 57 FR 13393 (April 16, 1992);
33171 (November 9, 1993 58 FR 60892 (November 18, 1993). In addition, the BSE's comparable rule filing (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;19)
is still under consideration (See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33587 (February 7, 1994), 59 FR 6895 (February
14, 1994).

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission restates its understanding that a number of firms with regional specialist operations have established
Chinese Wall procedures between the specialist and its affiliated firm. Nevertheless, such procedures have not
necessarily been adopted by all specialist affiliates, have not been adopted pursuant to any specific regional exchange
requirements, and have not been subject to specific exchange surveillance and oversight. Consistent with the NYSE/Amex
Order, the Commission has continued to encourage the regional exchanges to adopt Chinese Wall procedures.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
16

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission staff has specifically contacted the Pacific Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, and BSE, requesting them to detail the procedures each exchange has implemented for surveillance
of compliance with the Chinese Wall procedures adopted by firms affiliated with exchange specialists.

</FOOTNOTE>


The NYSE/Amex Order, in addressing the need for regional exchanges to participate in the regulation of affiliations
between specialist operations and diversified broker-dealer firms, took into account the fact that regional exchanges
differ from the primary exchanges in terms of order flow and market information. While noting that overall regional
exchange volume is small compared to primary market volume, and regional exchange pricing of orders is generally
derived from primary market quotations, the Commission expressed its concern that the diversion by a large retail
broker-dealer of all or a significant portion of order flow in speciality stocks to an affiliated regional specialist
could raise regulatory concerns similar to those raised by such affiliations on the primary exchanges. Moreover
the Commission noted that even if regional exchange specialists continued to set their prices based on primary market
quotations, a regional specialist affiliated with an integrated retail firm could obtain significant access to
material, non-public information.

The Commission continues to believe that Chinese Walls, with effective controls, may be useful in restricting information
flow between the various departments of broker-dealers. The Commission has monitored the NYSE and Amex Chinese Wall
rules since their inception, and generally believes they have proven effective in the context of specialists and
affiliated approved persons.

The Commission believes that the BSE proposal effectively addresses the potential for market abuses resulting from
the ongoing relationship between specialists and affiliated approved persons. The effectiveness of the procedures
set forth in the BSE guidelines is reinforced by the Exchange's existing surveillance of specialist and the marketplace
as well as the specialist's highly visible position in the marketplace. These factors, along with the specialist's
existing statutory duty to maintain a fair and orderly market, should combine to enhance the effectiveness of the
proposed Chinese Wall.

Finally, the Commission notes that the structural adequacy of the Chinese Wall is only one part of evaluating whether
the procedures established by the Exchange will detect and deter potential improper activity by either the approved
person or the specialist. Appropriate surveillance procedures are critical to ensure that the Chinese Wall is maintained.
To this end, the Exchange has submitted to the Commission proposed procedures for monitoring the Chinese Wall.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also notes that the Exchange has represented that it believes that it has adequate staffing capacity
to monitor compliance and conduct independent reviews of member firms.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
17

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange has requested that these procedures be accorded confidential treatment by the Commission.

</FOOTNOTE>


IV. Conclusion



It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;17) is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300</DOCTITLE>


May 18, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on April 19, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to amend certain of its rules to provide for the listing and trading on the Exchange of options on the
Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Nikkei 300'' or ``Index''),
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a cash-settled broad-based index with European-style exercise.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The CBOE has represented that the designations ``Nikkei Stock Index 300'' and ``Nikkei 300'' are property of Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, Inc.
</FOOTNOTE>


The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to amend its rules to provide for the listing and trading
of options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300. The Index is comprised of 300 representative stocks of the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE'').
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange believes that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the
performance of the Japanese economy and hedging against the risk of investing in that economy.



<FOOTNOTE>

First section stocks are distinguished from second section stocks by more stringent listing standards. Telephone
conversation between Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBOE, and Francois Mazur,
Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (May 16, 1994).

</FOOTNOTE>


Index Design:

 The Index was designed by and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The CBOE represents that Index component
stocks were selected by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. for their high market capitalization and their high degree of liquidity,
and are representative of the industrial composition of the broader Japanese equity market. The Index is weighted
by the market capitalization of the component stocks.

The median capitalization of the firms in the Index on March 31, 1994, was 

y

340.1 billion.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The average market capitalization of these firms was US$7.5 billion on the same date using the same rate of exchange.
The individual market capitalization of these firms ranged from US$875 million to US$76.5 billion on March 31, 1994.
The largest stock accounted for 3.41% of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04%.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
4

</FOOTNAME>
US$3.3 billion at the exchange rate of 

y

102.75 per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>




Calculation:

 The value of the Index is determined by adding the price of each stock times the number of shares outstanding. This sum
is then divided by a divisor which gives the Index a value of 100 on its base date of October 1, 1982. This divisor is adjusted
for pertinent changes as described below in the section titled ``Maintenance.'' The Index had a closing value of 296.35
on April 13, 1994.



Maintenance:

 The Index will be maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. To maintain continuity of the Index, the divisor of the Index
will be adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component stocks. These events include, but are not limited
to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions.
The composition of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.

Index Option Trading: 

The Exchange proposes to base trading in options on the Index on the full value of the Index as expressed in U.S. dollars.
The Exchange also may provide for the listing of full-value, long-term options series (``LEAPS'') and reduced-value
LEAPS on the Index. For reduced-value LEAPS, the underlying value would be computed at one-tenth of the value of the
Index. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value LEAP will, after such initial computation, be
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. The trading hours for options on the Index will be from 8 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., Chicago
time. Because the TSE does not operate during the Exchange's trading hours, the Exchange will disseminate the value
of the Index based on the most recent closing value of the Index.


Exercise and Settlement: 

The proposed options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus,
trading in the expiring contract month will normally cease on a Thursday at 3:15 p.m., Chicago time, unless a holiday
occurs. The exercise settlement value of Index options at expiration will be determined at the close of the regular
Friday trading sessions in Japan, ordinarily at 3 p.m., Tokyo time. If a stock does not trade during this interval or
if it fails to open for trading, the last available price of the stock will be used in the calculation of the Index. When
option expiration dates are changed in accordance with Exchange holidays, such as when the CBOE is closed on the Friday
before expiration, the last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday and the exercise settlement value
of the Index will be determined at the close of the regular Thursday trading sessions in Japan even if the Japanese markets
are open on Friday. If the Japanese markets will be closed on the Friday before expiration but the CBOE will not, the
last trading day for expiring options will be Wednesday.


Surveillance Agreements: 

The Exchange expects to apply its existing index options surveillance procedures to Index options. The Exchange
is pursuing market surveillance agreements with the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the TSE. These agreements will
enable the Exchange to carry out its regulatory responsibilities with respect to the surveillance of trading in the
stocks comprising the Index.


Position Limits: 

The Exchange is proposing to establish position limits for Nikkei 300 Index options equal to 50,000 contracts on the
same side of the market, with no more than 30,000 contracts in the series with the nearest expiration date. Ten reduced-value
options will equal one full-value contract for such purposes.


Exchange Rules Applicable: 

Except as modified herein, the Rules in Chapter XXIV will be applicable to Nikkei 300 Index options.
CBOE has represented that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction
of Nikkei 300 Index options.
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it will permit trading in options based on the Nikkei Stock
Index 300 pursuant to rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just
and equitable principals of trade, and thereby will provide investors with the ability to invest in options based
on an additional index.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;14 and should be submitted by June 14, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Extensions of Time for Payment or Delivery of Securities</DOCTITLE>


May 17, 1994.


I. Introduction and Background


On November 16, 1988, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'' or ``Exchange Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposal to amend the NYSE Rules to add new NYSE Rule 434 that would require all member organizations for which the
Exchange has been appointed the designated examining authority (``DEA'') by the Commission pursuant to Rule 17d&hyph;1
under the Act
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 to submit requests for extensions of time for payment, under Regulation T promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board
(``FRB''),
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 or delivery of securities, pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;3(n) under the Act,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 to the Exchange.

 The Commission determined to republish the notice for comment because of the significant period of time that had lapsed
since the proposal initially was published in the 

Federal Register

 and because of the number of comment letters that were received concerning the proposal. In addition, in 1992, the
Federal Reserve Board issued advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to modify Regulation T,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and specifically noted the NYSE proposal in its request for comments. The FRB has not yet acted on its proposal, however,
and has not published a timetable for doing so.

II. Description of the Proposal



Registered national securities exchanges and registered national securities associations can grant broker-dealers
extensions of time for payment on purchases and for delivery on sales of securities pursuant to Regulation T and Rule
15c3&hyph;3(n) under the Act. Such extensions may be granted when the self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') is
satisfied that a creditor (broker/dealer/ is acting in good faith in making such a request and when the creditor believes
exceptional circumstances warrant such action. The Exchange is proposing the addition of new Rule 434, which would
require all member firms for which the NYSE has been appointed the DEA under the Act to submit all requests for Regulation
T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 extensions to the NYSE.

The NYSE has developed a computerized extension processing system for reviewing extension requests. The Exchange
system contains specific criteria regarding acceptable reasons, number of days permitted per extension, and limits
on the number of extensions permitted. These criteria facilitate the prompt collection of monies and securities
due and reduce exposure to losses for both customers and member organizations. The Exchange system generates daily
and monthly reports which provide member organizations and Exchange staff with a means to monitor the incidence and
reasons for the extension, potential abuses, compliance with appropriate regulations, and indications of possible
operational problems.

The NYSE believes it is appropriate to require submission of extension requests to the DEA for several reasons. First,
as the DEA for most of its member, the NYSE is responsible for examining its members for compliance with industry financial
responsibility rules and the Exchange believes that complete extension information is needed for it to adequately
perform its DEA functions under section 17(d) of the Act.

Second, the only standards for extension requests under Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 are that the creditor grant
the request in good faith and that exceptional circumstances warrant an extension. Under this broad standard, each
SRO that processes extension requests
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 has developed its own parameters and procedures for evaluating, granting, and controlling extension requests.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange asserts that, as a result, broker-dealers could forum-shop by applying for extensions from several
or all SROs to circumvent the special requirements or the maximum number of extensions allowed by the NYSE. In the NYSE's
view, adoption of the rule would ensure uniform application of standards to all customers of NYSE firms for which the
NYSE is the DEA.




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
13

</FOOTNAME>
At the time the NYSE filed the proposed rule change, the Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago, Pacific and Philadelphia Stock
Exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers processed Regulation T extension requests. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 26341 (December 5, 1988), 53 FR 49808 (December 9, 1988).


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
14

</FOOTNAME>
For example, acceptable reasons for the extension, number of extensions permitted, special limitations and restrictions
on customers are not necessarily uniformly applied, and in some cases, possibly, not applied at all.


</FOOTNOTE>


Third, the Exchange believes that complete extension information would provide it with a valuable surveillance
tool in detecting manipulation and other illegal trading activities. Rule 434 would ensure that credit extensions
would be granted on the basis of complete information about a broker-dealer's payment and delivery status. The NYSE
states that complete extension information would enable the NYSE to better monitor for compliance with financial
and customer related rules, such as sales practice rules. Moreover, the NYSE believes that complete extension information
would be useful to a DEA as an early indicator of operational difficulties at member firms.



III. Comments on the Proposal



The Commission received eighteen comment letters opposing or suggesting substantial modifications to the NYSE
proposal and two comment letters expressing support for the proposal.



A. Competitive Concerns



Most of the commenters opposed to the NYSE proposal noted their competitive concerns, citing either section 11A(a)(1)
of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 which encourages automation and efficiency in the markets while assuring fair competition,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 or section 6(b)(8) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 which requires that the rules of an SRO not impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. In particular, commenters argue that competition among SROs has led to technological improvements
in extension granting procedures, such as faster turnaround and customized reports generated, and that competition
has resulted in lower fees to broker-dealers. These commenters assert that the proposal would be anti-competitive
in that the vast majority of all requests for extension of time for payment or delivery of securities would go to the
NYSE because the NYSE is the DEA for virtually all of its member firms.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See e.g., Securities Settlement Corp. Letter, 

supra

 note 9. The Securities Settlement Corp. Letter states that competition in the area of extension processing is consistent
with section 11A(a)(1)(C) which states that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors
to assure fair competition among exchange markets and between exchange markets.

</FOOTNOTE>


The CSE asserts that the proposal would grant the NYSE a monopoly on extension processing, thereby imposing a chilling
effect on innovation and stifling any initiative by an SRO to contribute to more efficient and effective market operations.
The CSE further asserts that the proposal would remove any incentive for an SRO to offer technical enhancements to
improve the ability of brokers-dealers to comply with their legal obligations and manage the risk associated with
extensions of credit.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
19

</FOOTNAME>
The PHLX and the Securities Corp. also assert that the NYSE proposal would lessen incentives for further improvements
in services. See 1989 PHLX Letter and Securities Settlement Corp. Letter, 

supra

 note 9.

<TEXT>
 

As an example, the CSE asserts that it has responded to the industry's need for better risk management tools and technical
innovations. The CSE states that it initiated customized supervisory reports, batch transmission capability and
next-morning electronic access to disposition reports. The CSE believes that these enhancements help to create
a more efficient and orderly marketplace.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Likewise, Lehman Brothers asserts that the NYSE replaced a cumbersome and manually intensive processing system
only after competing automated systems had been developed by the CSE and the CHX.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Both the CHX and CSE point out that they have expended considerable expense and effort to develop a computerized extension
processing system. 



<FOOTNOTE>

supra

 note 9.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
21

</FOOTNAME>
See Lehman Brothers Letter, 

supra

 note 11. The letter states that while Lehman Brothers submits its extension requests to the NYSE, it has clearly benefited
from the competition between the exchanges and the NASD in the form of improved services. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Various commenters assert that by contributing to the NYSE's overall monopolistic position within the national
marketplace, the proposal will seriously impair other SROs' ability to complete with the NYSE. For example, both
the CSE and PSE state that the anti-competitive effects of this proposal go beyond extension processing services
to impact on the larger concept of the entire regulatory package of services that each exchange can provide, which
is one of the factors that firms look at when considering membership and the routing of order flow.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
22

</FOOTNAME>
See 1993 CSE Letter and 1993 PSE Letter, 

supra

 note 11.

</FOOTNOTE>


Some commenters assert that the NYSE's concerns could be addressed, and the anti-competitive effects diminished,
through less restrictive means. Some of these commenters suggest that the regulatory objectives could be met through
the development of uniform industry standards for processing extension requests and by formalizing information
sharing arrangements.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
23

</FOOTNAME>
See 

e.g.,

 January 1989 and July 1989 CSE Letters; 1989 CHX Letter; 1989 PSE Letter, 

supra

 note 9, and Lehman Brothers Letter, 

supra

 note 11. The CSE, PSE, CHX and Lehman Brothers Letters all state that information sharing would be the appropriate
alternative to the proposal. The CSE, for example, states that it shares all of its extension processing information
with the DEAs.

</FOOTNOTE>


In addition to information sharing, commenters suggest that uniform industry standards for processing extension
requests could ameliorate the NYSE's concerns. The CSE suggests that the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''),
in cooperation with the Commission, should develop uniform industry standards for the processing of extensions
since, currently, there is no recognized way to evaluate individual extension requests.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD suggests that broker-dealers should be able to submit extension requests to any SRO as long as there are comparable
review criteria and the SRO has policies and procedures that make regulatory use of the data.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>

<TEXT>
 

Lehman Brothers and A.G. Edwards comment that, to the extent that consistency is the NYSE's objective, the proposal
is an incomplete solution because it has no impact on the processing of margin extension requests for non-NYSE firms.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Lehman Brothers asserts that consistency could be achieved more effectively by the FRB or Commission dictating uniform
processing criteria for all SROs although if does not believe that they are necessary at the present time.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
26

</FOOTNAME>
See Lehman Brothers Letter and A.G. Edwards Letter, 

supra

 note 11.

</FOOTNOTE>


Some commenters conclude that it appears that competition has led to lower extension fees for broker-dealers. These
commenters assert that the NYSE currently charges more than the other SROs granting extension requests. These commenters
also assert that if the proposal is approved, the NYSE will not be subject to competition from other SROs and thus it
will be free to charge any amount it wishes for extensions. For example, the Gradison Letter states that competition
is the key to keeping regulatory costs under control.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Likewise, First of Michigan states that it submits its extension requests to the CSE and its costs have been reduced.
The PHLX states that approval of the NYSE proposal would leave as the only discipline on the NYSE's extension fees Commission
review of such fees pursuant to section 6(b)(4) of the Act to assure that there was ``equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees and other charges among its members *&blank;*&blank;*''
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The PHLX asserts that such review is inevitably inexact and is far less preferable to relying on the competitive discipline
of the market to assure fair and appropriate fees.

</FOOTNOTE>


B. The Viability of the Existing Process



Various SRO commenters assert that the NYSE proposal is unnecessary because there has not been any showing that the
current extension approval process does not work.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 For example, both the CSE and Gradison Letters assert that there is no evidence that the CSE has not adequately monitored
extensions.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The CSE further argues that adoption of the NYSE proposal is unnecessary because the Commission has found that the
CSE has a good extension program.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Bartlett and Company states that the CSE has effectively monitored the extension approval process and
it would be inefficient, uneconomical, and extremely inconvenient for it to submit its extension requests to the
NYSE.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Securities Settlement Corporation states that it has been filing extension requests with the CSE and it has concluded
that the CSE has provided cost effective service and financial reports that the NYSE has not been able to provide.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>

Some commenters question the NYSE's portrayal of the current regulatory environment, and claim that their extension
processing system is comparable to that of the NYSE. The CSE and PHLX, for example, state that there is much more uniformity
than the NYSE proposal implies.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 The CSE states that it believes that it uses the same parameters and procedures as the NYSE for evaluating, granting
and controlling extensions as well as the same acceptable reasons, acceptable number of extensions permitted, special
limitations and restrictions on customers as the NYSE. The PHLX states that it grants extensions for reasons similar
to those accepted by the NYSE, and that both the NYSE and the PHLX grant extensions for similar lengths of time.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 The CHX also states that it applies the same parameters and procedures for evaluating, granting and controlling extension
requests as are used by the NYSE.

C. Inconsistency With the Act



Some commenters assert that the NYSE proposal is inconsistent with the Act.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 These commenters state that Regulation T and SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;3 permit a broker-dealer to apply to any SRO for an
extension. Thus, broker-dealers should be free to choose an SRO on the basis of convenience, service and cost efficiency.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 For example, the CHX states that approval of the NYSE proposal would be contrary to the intent of Regulation T and Rule
15c3&hyph;3, which is to provide flexible SRO oversight of the processing of Regulation T extensions. Lehman Brothers
argues that the current extension procedures can only be altered by petitioning the FRB or the Commission to make a
rule change since both Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 permit broker-dealers to send extension requests to any
SRO.

D. Claims of Forum Shopping



The PHLX states that it is unaware of any instance in which a broker-dealer changed from one SRO to another in order to
circumvent an SRO's extension guidelines. The PHLX states that the reasons that its members have given for choosing
to send extension requests to one SRO over another are, 

inter alia, 

convenience, turn-around time and information provided by the SRO, such as providing the number of requests emanating
from a particular branch.

Similarly, the CSE states that there is no evidence to support the NYSE's assertions that several NYSE members began
using the CSE for extension processing after the NYSE took restrictive action against them.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 The CSE states that, had it been aware of such restrictive action by the NYSE, it would have cooperated in restricting
the firm.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
41

</FOOTNAME>
See July 1989 CSE Letter, 

supra 

note 9.
</FOOTNOTE>


E. Harm to the NASD That Would Result From Implementation of the NYSE Proposal



The NASD's comment letter asserts that it would be harmed in a number of unique ways if the NYSE proposal is approved.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD states that it has significant regulatory and examination responsibility for all of its members, and that
extension information is not relevant exclusively to financial and operational monitoring as the NYSE seems to assert.
The NASD believes that extension requests contain valuable data which is useful to an SRO for general market surveillance
to detect possible market or trading abuses.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
42

</FOOTNAME>
See 1989 NASD Letter, 

supra 

note 9.


</FOOTNOTE>


In addition, the NASD notes that a significant portion of customer activities involving NASDAQ and OTC securities
is handled by NASD/NYSE members, and if it were mandated that such members file all extension requests with the NYSE,
then the NASD would be deprived of significant important regulatory data involving the marketplace that it is required
to regulate. The NASD further asserts that the resulting fragmentation of NASDAQ and OTC market data would be counterproductive
to establishing efficient regulation. It states that approval of the NYSE proposal, therefore, would deprive the
NASD of significant and important regulatory data currently used to fulfill its SRO functions.



F. Miscellaneous Comments



&bull;Extension Requests Should be Granted by Broker-Dealers



The Bear Stearns and A.G. Edwards Letters assert that brokers-dealers should not be required to submit requests for
extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities to any SRO. These commenters esentially assert that broker-dealer
is in the best position to know when exceptional circumstances warrant an extension and, in any event, assume the financial
risk from such extensions. The Bear Stearns Letter asserts that suitable procedures can be established for broker-dealers
to control the time periods within which payment or delivery of securities are made, without the need for the formal
submission of requests for permission to extend the time periods. The A.G. Edwards Letter disagrees with the FRB's
concern that broker-dealers may grant favorable extension review to certain customers. It believes that broker-dealers
should be required periodically to notify an SRO to act as a monitor for abuses of the Rule and provide its members with
periodic reports.

&bull;Fees from Extensions Help Defray the Cost of DEA Functions



The CSE states that it is relieving the NYSE of the cost of processing extensions since the NYSE is allocated only the
on-site portion of the broker-dealer examination relating to extensions, and the cost associated with the NYSE's
DEA function is already covered by the NYSE's fee structure in that, pursuant to NYSE Rule 142, the NYSE charges its
members $.42 per $1,000 gross revenue for regulatory services. Therefore, according to the CSE, the NYSE has no need
for additional revenue to subsidize its DEA functions.

&bull;Discussion of Section 17(d) of the Act



Both the PHLX and the CSE argue that the NYSE misapprehends the principal purpose of section 17(d) of the Act, which
is to avoid unnecessary regulatory duplication and, secondarily, to assure that violations are not missed because
they fall between the responsibilities of different SROs. They state that submission of extension requests by a broker-dealer
to an SRO other than its DEA results in no duplicative regulation or burdens on broker-dealers. The PHLX states that,
to the extent that processing of extension request by multiple SROs could cause any one SRO's financial or regulatory
oversight to be incomplete, this can be addressed through the coordination between SROs.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
45

</FOOTNAME>
The PHLX believes that extension requests are far less useful indicators of potential broker-dealer financial or
regulatory concerns than other indicia such as an increased number of uncompared or adjusted trades, net capital
deficiencies or intra-day monitoring of large trades or positions in active markets.

</FOOTNOTE>


The CSE asserts that the existence of a Rule 17d&hyph;2 agreement between the CSE and the NYSE does not mean that the
CSE has abrogated its SRO authority to the NYSE. It asserts that under its Rule 17d&hyph;2 agreement with the NYSE,
the CSE retains responsibility to enforce compliance with the CSE's extension rule, and the NYSE is only allocated
the responsibility to conduct regular on-site examinations to ensure compliance with this rule.

The CSE further asserts that the concept of sharing extension request data between SROs and the DEA is not, as the NYSE
claims, inconsistent with the intent of SEC Rules 17d&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;2. The CSE states that, as an SRO, it could
conduct its own special examinations of, or participate in a joint regulatory effort with respect to firms who file
extensions with the Exchange. The CSE asserts that it has the necessary examination responsibilities and ongoing
regulatory relationship with its extension firms to justify the continued processing of extension requests. The
CSE concludes that as a non-DEA SRO, it is in a position to make a good faith and informed judgment whether ``exceptional
circumstances'' warrant the granting of extensions.



G. Comments In Support of the Proposal



Two commenters express support for the proposal. Financial Clearing and Services Corporation (``FCSC'')
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 states that it agrees that the NYSE proposal serves a valid regulatory purpose. FCSC notes, however, that the Commission
should remain cognizant of the fact that new rules must not lessen competition nor should they adversely affect technical
innovation.

</FOOTNOTE>


The FRB staff expresses support for the purposes behind the NYSE's proposal. The FRB staff notes that the DEA is ultimately
responsible for monitoring those firms that it examines in other areas of the securities business where credit may
be a significant factor, such as sales practices. The FRB staff further states that it questions the propriety of an
SRO with virtually no general examination responsibility passing on extensions of time since such SROs may lack the
requisite experience in correlating credit extensions with other areas of regulatory concern.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 The FRB staff believes that only SROs with examination responsibilities of some kind should grant extensions of time.
In this regard, the FRB specifies that, 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See FRB Letter, 

supra

 note 9.

</FOOTNOTE>


``In our view, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for an SRO to meet the requirements of the present rule (12 CFR
220.4(c)(3)(ii)) unless the SRO has some ongoing regulatory relationship with the applicant to support a belief
as to the good faith of the applicant or the sufficiency of the determination that ``exceptional circumstances''
warrant the extension.''

The FRB Letter asserts that the FRB anticipated that the exceptions to the Regulation T requirements governing payment
for securities would be minimal, and that, ``[n]o one ever perceived the granting of extensions of time as a profit-making
endeavor.''
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 The FRB Letter also states that, for the extension request process to be effective, cooperation, and not competition,
among SROs is essential. In this regard, the FRB Letter states that it appears that the change in the rule to allow any
SRO to grant extension requests ``may have inadvertently permitted regulatory concerns to be subordinated to the
profit motive.''
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 The FRB staff also expresses the view that if the extension-granting service is viewed as a profit center, it can only
encourage more extensions of time.

IV. The NYSE's Responses



In May 1989, the NYSE submitted a letter to the Commission responding to negative comments by the CSE, CHX, PHLX, PSE,
Bartlett &amp; Company, Gradison &amp; Company, and the Securities Settlement Corporation with respect to the Exchange's
proposed Rule 434. In January, 1994, the NYSE submitted another letter responding to comments sent to the Commission
by the CSE, PSE, Bear Stearns Securities Corp, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. and Lehman Brothers after the Commission
republished notice of this proposal. The NYSE's responses to the commenters are summarized below.

A. Burden on Competition



The NYSE acknowledges that some loss of revenue to other SROs may result from its proposed rule, but disagrees that
the proposal will have a significant anti-competitive effect on the marketplace that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The NYSE also asserts that proposed NYSE Rule 434 is justified from a regulatory
perspective and that arguments regarding competition as they relate to revenues are inappropriate.

In support of its contention that the proposed NYSE Rule 434 is justified, the NYSE asserts first that, as DEA for most
of its members, the Exchange is charged with overseeing compliance by its members with the applicable financial responsibility
rules. The Exchange believes that the information gathered in processing extension requests is essential in carrying
out its statutory oversight responsibilities.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
53

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange also states that the FRB concurs that the DEA has ultimate responsibility in monitoring those firms which
it examines, and that even the CSE acknowledges that this information is important to the DEA.

</FOOTNOTE>


Second, pursuant to agreements with other SROs, the NYSE has assumed responsibility to oversee compliance by its
members with sales practices and related rules of the NYSE and other SROs. Information derived from extension requests
is necessary to perform effective on-site review as this is a significant means for detecting potential sales practices
problems.

Third, the NYSE believes that the proposal does not conflict with federal laws permitting any SRO to approve extensions
of time. The NYSE states that while 1980 amendments to Regulation T and similar changes to Rule 15c3&hyph;3 under the
Act permitted any SRO to grant extensions, the FRB issued a letter outlining procedures to be followed when a non-DEA
SRO considers such requests, including notification of the DEA. The NYSE also notes that the FRB Comment Letter states
that modern technology has significantly altered the convenience benefits of the 1980 amendments, and that the authority
of non-DEAs to grant extensions should be on an exception basis.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
54

</FOOTNAME>
Along these lines, the NYSE's 1989 Comment Letter states that 99.6% of all extension requests received by the Exchange
are transmitted electronically.

</FOOTNOTE>


Fourth, the NYSE asserts that concentrated regulatory responsibilities under Exchange Act Rules 17d&hyph;1
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 and 17d&hyph;2
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 require that the NYSE obtain continuous first-hand information from its DEA firms and process such information.
The NYSE further asserts that, because the Exchange already has 17d&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;2 responsibility for regulation
of its members, it does not make good regulatory sense to break out one aspect of regulation for the economic benefit
of individual SROs. The Exchange cites to the FRB Letter, which states: ``We certainly would question the propriety
of an SRO with virtually no general examination responsibilities passing on extensions of time as experience might
be lacking in correlating credit extensions with other areas of regulatory concern.''
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

<FOOTNAME>
56

</FOOTNAME>
Rule 17d&hyph;2_Program for Allocation of Regulatory Responsibility_deals with the creation of plans between
SROs to allocate responsibility to receive regulatory reports from persons who are members or participants of more

of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
57

</FOOTNAME>
See FRB Letter, 

supra

 note 9 at 2.

</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the NYSE asserts that arguments that the proposal violates section 11A(a)(1) of the Act are ``ill conceived.''
The NYSE states that section 11A(a)(1), pertaining to the national market system, is basically concerned with efficient,
effective and competitive trading systems and not regulatory obligations.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, the NYS does not agree that proposed Rule 434 would have a negative impact on the extension processing system
in terms of efficiency or technical innovation. The NYSE asserts that it has been a pioneer in developing and computerizing
the extension processing system, and that other SROs copied its efforts. The NYSE states that it is committed to increasing
efficiency in the process, which is reflected through, 

e.g.

, its committment of staff dedicated to monitoring extension requests.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The NYSE stated, at the time of the 1989 response letter, that it had a 5-person professional staff as well as a group
of about 128 examiners and 32 coordinators who add integral surveillance support to the Credit Regulation Function,
and that it believed its staff to be unique to the industry.

</FOOTNOTE>


B. A Program of Sharing Information



The NYSE does not believe information sharing between SROs would be practical. First, the NYSE states that it needs
to have extension information on-line. The NYSE states that it needs to make immediate decisions in order to perform
daily regulatory responsibilities. Information and reports received after the fact would not be as valuable.

Second, the NYSE states that current SRO systems are not compatible and could not be linked because of different parameters
and methods of processing data. The NYSE also states that information provided by other SROs would be of little use
to the NYSE because each SRO makes decisions based on its own standards.

Third, the NYSE states that the expense necessary to link current SRO systems would be substantial and other SROs would
look to the NYSE to pay the majority of the cost associated with the changes since the NYSE processes 85% of its members'
extensions. The NYSE also states that it does not believe that the expense is justifiable since it performs all of the
tasks associated with margin positions, and other SROs have little or no need for this information. The NYSE asserts
that its regulatory costs should not be increased in order to justify the non-regulatory purposes of other SROs, and
that such costs will be passed on to customers.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-2-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the NYSE states that the concept of sharing extension data by other SROs with the DEA is inconsistent with
the intent of Rules 17d&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;2 under the Act. The DEA initiatives were adopted in order to eliminate
unnecessary duplication by concentrating regulatory functions within one SRO and relieving all other SROs of their
responsibility to examine for compliance with relevant rules under the Act.



C. Lack of Uniform Standards



In its comment letter, the NYSE maintains that there are no uniform extension processing standards among the SROs,
despite several SROs' assertions that their standards are comparable to those of the NYSE. The NYSE states that it
does not believe that the CSE's standards for extension review are comparable to those of the NYSE, and it cites examples
of situations taken from CSE extension reports that the NYSE would find unacceptable.
The NYSE also believes that as long as filing extension requests with a firm's DEA is not mandatory, the Exchange is
constrained from incorporating more effective regulatory tools into its system. The NYSE believes that those firms
that require the greatest scrutiny and oversight will commence filing for extensions with another SRO if the NYSE
takes restrictive action. The NYSE cites examples of broker-dealers that switched from the NYSE to the CSE after restrictive
action was filed against them. The NYSE believes that the impetus for these switches was not efficiency or economics,
as stated by the CSE, but rather to avoid regulations intended to ensure extensions are granted for legitimate purposes
and to prevent excessive credit in the securities markets.

Finally, the NYSE dismisses suggestions by some commenters that the ISG should develop these standards in conjunction
with the Commission. The NYSE states that the purpose of ISG is to deal with market operations related projects rather
than with credit issues.



D. Miscellaneous Comments



The NYSE states that the CSE was in error when it asserted that the cost associated with the Exchange's DEA function
is already covered by the Exchange's fee structure. The NYSE states that it charges its members a regulatory service
fee pursuant to Rule 129 for financial oversight responsibilities but such fee does not cover regulatory services
with respect to sales practices which are a significant aspect of monitoring credit extensions.

The NYSE disagrees with the CSE's assertion that extension processing by the CSE relieves the NYSE of regulatory expense,
because the NYSE must conduct field examinations of all of its members, including those who process extensions through
the CSE. The NYSE suggests that the CSE may be able to charge less per extension than the NYSE because the CSE has no field
examination capabilities to monitor credit extension and thus, does not incur costs for maintaining an examination
program.

The NYSE disagrees with the concerns that approval of Rule 434 would give the NYSE monopoly power with respect to pricing.
The NYSE states that it would impose a price increase unless appropriate. Moreover, the NYSE notes that any fee increase
would be subject to Commission review.

The NYSE states that it agrees with the FRB's conclusion that only SROs with some examination responsibilities should
grant extensions, as well as its conclusion that it would be difficult or impossible to comply with the Regulation
T requirement that exceptional circumstances warrant an extension if the SRO does not have an ongoing regulatory
relationship with the broker-dealer requesting the extension. The NYSE also notes that it processes 85% of the extensions
generated by its members and thus economics is not its major consideration in proposing Rule 434. The NYSE states that
equal and effective regulation of its members is the primary goal of the proposal.

The Exchange does not believe it is appropriate to allow a broker-dealer to grant extensions of time to its own customers
given the potential for conflict between regulatory and customer service considerations.

Finally, the NYSE states that, since its 1989 letter, it has continued to undertake enhancements to its automated
extension processing system. In January, 1994, it implemented a system to transmit daily extension reports back
to member organizations. According to the Exchange, over 99% of all extension requests received by the Exchange are
processed and returned electronically to member organizations the same day so that extension data is available to
them before the start of the next business day. The NYSE is not aware of any other SRO which provides this service.



V. Discussion



After careful consideration of the comments received as well as applicable statutory provisions, the Commission
believes that proposed NYSE Rule 434, which would require all NYSE member firms for which the NYSE is the DEA to submit
their requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities to the NYSE, is consistent with the ACT,
and in particular, sections 6(b) (5) and (8) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
60

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (5) and (8) (1988).

</FOOTNOTE>


Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The
Commission believes that proposed NYSE Rule 434 will serve to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and to protect
investors and the public interest by enhancing the NYSE's ability to monitor the continued financial viability of
its member firms where it is the DEA. In addition, the proposed rule will help the NYSE to ensure its members' compliance
with the requirements of Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 of the Act. The Commission also believes that NYSE Rule
434 will help to effectuate uniform standards for NYSE members' requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery
of securities. The uniform application of the NYSE's standards to a large majority of its member firms' extension
requests will promote fairness by helping to ensure equal treatment for NYSE member firms.

As the DEA for most of its member firms, the NYSE is responsible for examining such firms for compliance with the financial
responsibility rules.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that information about extensions for payment or delivery of securities is essential in
helping the NYSE carry out its DEA responsibilities under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 require that extensions be granted only if the broker-dealer is
acting in good faith and exceptional circumstances exist to warrant an extension. As the DEA, the NYSE must ensure
that requests that are granted have met these conditions. Under the current structure, however, another SRO may grant
numerous extensions without the NYSE being adequately informed as to the nature of the requests and the conditions
under which they are being granted. This not only can impair the NYSE's ability to ensure member firm compliance with
financial responsibility rules but it can affect the NYSE's ability to detect potential sales practice problems.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
61

</FOOTNAME>
For firms where the NYSE is the DEA, the Exchange is responsible for examining the firms' compliance with rules pertaining
to, among other things: Hypothecation or lending in customer reserve accounts (under section 8 of the Act); the maintenance
of books and records (under section 17(a) of the Act); capital, margin or recordkeeping (under section 17(d) of the
Act); broker-dealer balance sheets (under section 17(e) of the Act), or any other Commission or SRO rules relating
to the protection of customer accounts or securities.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
62

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission agrees with the NYSE's claim that information derived from extension requests is necessary, among
other things, to perform effective on-site review to detect potential sales practice problems. See 1989 NYSE Letter,


supra

 note 10.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
63

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission notes that the NASD has expressed concern that this proposal would prevent the NASD from obtaining
extension information necessary to perform its SRO functions. The NASD states that the proposal would prevent the
NASD from obtaining information regarding a large number of its members since a significant portion of customer activities
involving NASDAQ and OTC securities is handled by NASD/NYSE members for whom the NYSE is the DEA. The Commission finds
this argument unpersuasive as the regulatory structure already distinguishes between DEA SROs and non-DEA SROs
and this proposal merely follows this distinction.

</FOOTNOTE>


Further, the rule change will serve to eliminate the possibility of forum shopping among SROs for extensions. For
example, the NYSE's 1989 comment letter notes instances where a NYSE member firm began to send its extension requests
to another SRO after the NYSE took restrictive action against it. Although some comment letters dispute the extent
of forum shopping, the Commission's experience in reviewing SRO compliance programs leads it to believe that the
potential for forum shopping for extensions exists under the current scheme and that approval of the NYSE proposal
will diminish this.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
64

</FOOTNAME>
In this regard, other SROs may wish to adopt similar rule proposals that would require those members for which the SRO
is the DEA to submit extension request to that SRO.

</FOOTNOTE>


In summary, given the NYSE's Rule 17d&hyph;1
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 17d&hyph;2
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 responsibilities under the Act, it will improve regulatory oversight by the NYSE if the Exchange receives extension
request information for firms for which it is the DEA so that it may have a complete picture of each member's financial
and regulatory situation. The proposed rule change will accomplish this by enabling the NYSE to have all the regulatory
information necessary to get a complete view of each NYSE member firm's activity so that the NYSE may more effectively
prevent members' financial difficulties or fraud.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also believes that implementing proposed NYSE Rule 434 is the simplest and quickest way to meet the
goal of ensuring that credit related financial restrictions placed upon a member firm are based upon complete information.
The Commission does not agree with assertions that the Act's objectives could be better met by implementing a uniform
system of sharing extension information. Although improved sharing of extension information would provide data
to the NYSE, it would not relay this information in time for the NYSE to act before the receiving SRO decides on an extension
request. In addition, information sharing would involve two SROs reviewing extension requests and result in substantial
expense and modifications of existing extension processing systems. This would necessarily involve considerable
duplication of efforts since two SROs would review extension information. In contrast, the NYSE proposal is consistent
with the current regulatory structure of designating one SRO as the DEA for firms that are members of more than one SRO.
The DEA scheme was adopted in order to eliminate unnecessary duplication of efforts in the area of member regulation.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Commission does not believe that the Act mandates that information sharing be utilized in place of
the NYSE's approach.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
67

</FOOTNAME>
See SEC Rule 17d&hyph;1, 17 CFR 240.17d&hyph;1 (1993), which provides that the Commission shall consider, 

inter alia,

 unnecessary regulatory duplication when designating an SRO for purposes of examination for compliance with financial
responsibility rules.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also believes that the regulatory benefits from NYSE Rule 434 outweigh any competitive concerns raised
by the commenters. Under section 6(b)(8) of the Act, the Commission may not approve an exchange rule if it imposes a
burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. For the reasons
discussed below, the Commission believes that any competitive burden raised by NYSE Rule 434 is necessary and appropriate
under the Act.

First, the Commission believes that the NYSE, as the DEA for most of its member firms, is in the best position to monitor
extension requests and to ensure that they do not affect the financial viability of member firms. In this regard, the
NYSE has a sound system for monitoring extension requests and ensuring that member firms do not exceed established
parameters. We do not believe that approval of the rule and the resulting lessening of competition for processing
NYSE members' requests will have a harmful effect on the system for handling credit extension requests. In particular,
because of the NYSE's responsibility as the DEA, it will have a continuing responsibility to ensure that firms are
not receiving numerous credit extensions that may indicate potential abuse and financial difficulties, and accordingly,
they will have an incentive to properly maintain their monitoring systems.

<TEXT>
 

Second, the Commission believes that the DEA may experience difficulty in meeting its responsibilities when extensions
are granted by another SRO.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 Consistent and current information about firm requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities
will help the NYSE to measure the financial viability of the firm. As the DEA, the NYSE is solely responsible for examining
its members for compliance with industry financial responsibility rules. Therefore, the Exchange is best-suited
to monitor and effectively impose restrictions on the extension of credit by its members. If the NYSE obtains all extension
information, credit related financial restrictions placed upon a member firm will be made based upon complete information,
comprising all extensions requested. Therefore, any potential burden on competition stemming from the NYSE proposal
is justified by the overriding regulatory benefit.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
68

</FOOTNAME>
See FRB Letter, 

supra 

note 9.

</FOOTNOTE>


Third, the Commission does not believe that the proposal reduces competition in an inappropriate manner. The SRO's
monitoring of margin requirements, as with their other regulatory responsibilities, was not and is not intended
to act as a profit making arm of the market activities of SROs. Provision of necessary regulatory services by the DEA
is an essential component of its statutory requirements, and should not be impaired by price competition from other
SROs who do not carry DEA responsibilities.

Fourth, as with any regulatory fee, the Commission has the authority under the Act to review and abrogate excessive
fees. Even if approval of the rule proposal eliminates fee competition, the Commission will continue to exercise
its statutory authority to ensure that only reasonable fees for extension requests are imposed by the NYSE on member
firms.

Section 6(b)(4) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988), requires that the rules of an exchange provide for the equitable
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges.

</FOOTNOTE>


Accordingly, for all of the above reasons, the Commission believes that to the extent that the proposal does impose
a burden on competition, such burden is justified as necessary and appropriate under the Act.

The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to approve the NYSE's proposal notwithstanding the fact that
both Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3 provide that a broker-dealer may go to any SRO for credit extension requests,
irrespective of whether the SRO is the broker-dealer's DEA. In this regard, the NYSE proposal does not prevent other
SROs from granting extension requests, but simply narrows the choice for firms for which the NYSE is the DEA. Firms
for which the NYSE is not the DEA can still use other SROs for their extension requests. In addition, the FRB has stated
that it supports the NYSE's proposal and that it generally believes that only SROs with examination responsibilities
of some kind should grant extensions. The FRB noted that the changes to Regulation T which were adopted in 1980 were
intended to accommodate firms who found it more convenient to send extension requests to a nearby SRO and that this
same need may not still exist in the computer age. Finally, because the terms of the proposal are not inconsistent with
Regulation T and Rule 15c3&hyph;3, and the proposal furthers the NYSE's responsibility under the Act, the Commission
believes that it is an appropriate exercise of the NYSE's ability to adopt rules consistent with the Act.

The CSE also argues that the NYSE proposal should be disapproved because there has been not showing that the current
extension approval systems have not been working.
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission does not believe that in order to approve a proposal there must be a showing that the current system is
not working, only a showing that the new rule would create better procedures or a better system and that the proposal
is consistent with the Act. As discussed above, the NYSE's proposal will improve the regulation of extension requests.
In addition, however, the Commission's review of extension request programs has indicated certain inadequacies
in the extension process at various SROs. These inadequacies could be reduced if the NYSE proposal is approved. Moreover,
the current structure lacks uniform standards and as a result can encourage forum shopping. Accordingly, the Commission
believes that the proposal will address these concerns and help to create a more effective review of credit extensions.
The Commission disagrees with the assertions of some commenters that approval of the proposal would be inconsistent
with section 11A of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) provides that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the
protection of investors to assure fair competition among exchange markets and between exchange markets. The NYSE
proposal will not prevent competition among SROs in their role as markets, and it is intended to make the extension
request process consistent with the DEA structure that the other SROs have already agreed to.

note 9 and 1993 CSE Letter,

note 11.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also disagrees with some commenters' argument that approval of NYSE Rule 434 would greatly enhance
the NYSE's power in the marketplace. 
Rule 434 will merely make such that in instances in which the NYSE is the DEA, the NYSE will obtain all pertinent regulatory
information about firm activities. The commenters have made no showing that the rule would affect other markets'
ability to compete for order flow. Moreover, the DEA program, to which all the SROs have joined, is intended to concentrate
the provision of regulatory services into the major SROs for efficiency and effectiveness. Proposed Rule 434 is a
logical adjunct to the DEA program.

Several commenters argue that broker-dealers should be able to submit extension requests to any SRO which is convenient
for them. The Commission, however, believes that proximity is not a significant factor because in today's electronic
environment it would generally be just as convenient to submit extension requests to the NYSE as it would be to submit
them to any other SRO.

Finally, the Commission does not agree with some commenters who argue that broker-dealers should not be required
to submit requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities to any SRO.
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 These commenters argue that broker-dealers should make such determinations since it is their capital at stake. The
Commission does not need to address these arguments in the context of this rule proposal which concerns the allocation
of extension requests among the SROs. The Commission, however, preliminarily believes that there is a need for checks
on the granting of such extensions by broker-dealers. Without SRO review in this area, broker-dealers would be free
to add unwarranted risk to securities transactions by granting credit in excess of what is reasonable or granting
excessive extensions of time in order to ensure that a transaction for which a commission is earned is completed. The
Commission, however, along with the FRB's ongoing review of Regulation T, will continue to examine these issues.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations




1. Banner Life (formerly, Government Employees Life Insurance Company) is a stock life insurance company and, since
December 1, 1983, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Legal &amp; General America, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Legal &amp; General International Limited, England. The ultimate controlling entity is Legal &amp; General Group
Plc., a United Kingdom company. Banner Life is principally engaged in offering life insurance and is licensed in the
District of Columbia and all states except Maine and New York.

2. Account B is a separate investment account established by Banner Life and registered with the Commission under
the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Account B will have a number of subaccounts, each of which will invest solely
in a specific corresponding portfolio of the Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund (``Scudder Fund''). The Scudder
Fund is a registered, diversified, open-end management investment company with a number of series, or portfolios.

3. The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable annuity policies that may be purchased on a non-tax qualified
basis or purchased and used in connection with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for
favorable federal income tax treatment. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;4 to register the Contracts under
the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act'') has been filed with the Commission.

4. Banner Financial will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Contracts. Banner Financial is
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.

5. Premium payments may be allocated to one or more subaccounts of Account B (``Subaccounts'') and be credited with
the investment experience of the selected Subaccount(s). Prior to the Maturity Date, a Contract Owner may surrender
all or a portion of the Account Value, or transfer Account Value between Subaccounts. The Contracts will provide for
a series of Annuity Payments and Annuity Payment Plans. The Contracts also will provide for the payment of a death benefit,
which is equal to the greatest of: (a) Account Value for the Valuation Period during which the Death Benefit election
is effective or is deemed to be effective; (b) total premiums made, less the sum of all partial withdrawals and loan
values; or (c) the Account Value on the seventh year anniversary immediately preceding the date the death benefit
election is effective or is deemed to become effective, adjusted for any subsequent premiums and partial withdrawals
and charges and loan values made between such seventh year anniversary and the date the election is effective or is
deemed to become effective.

6. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts. An annual maintenance charge of $25 will be deducted
from the Policy Value prior to the Maturity Date. This charge will be deducted on a pro-rata basis if the Contract is
surrendered during a Policy Year. The maintenance charge is to compensate Banner Life for the administrative services
and is guaranteed not to increase. Banner Life does not anticipate any profit from this charge. Additionally, a daily
Administrative Expense Charge equal to an effective annual rate of .10% of the net assets of the variable account will
be deducted. There currently is no charge for transfers, but Banner Life reserves the right to impose a fee for more
than twelve transfers in more than one year. Shares of the various Scudder Fund portfolios will be sold to Account B
at net asset value. Scudder Fund pays its investment adviser a fee for managing its investments and business affairs.
Each portfolio is also responsible for all of its expenses.

7. Banner Life will deduct the aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract upon annuitization
or surrender. No charges currently are made for federal, state or local taxes, other than premium taxes. Banner Life
may, however, deduct charges for such taxes from Account B in the future.

8. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'')
in the amount of up to 7% of total Premiums paid is imposed on certain full or partial withdrawals to cover expenses relating
to the sales of the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed: (a) Upon withdrawal of up to 15% of Account Value if it is the first
withdrawal in the current Policy Year; (b) if the Account Value is applied to an Annuity Payment Plan with payments
over at least a five year period; and (c) to premiums paid more than seven years ago as well as the 15% of premiums within
the prior seven years. In no event will the aggregate contingent deferred sales charge exceed 8.5% of aggregate premiums
paid. Banner Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing
the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from Banner Life's
general account assets, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks.

9. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.20% of the value of the net assets in Account B will be imposed
to compensate Banner Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Of this
amount, approximately one-third is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately two-thirds is attributable
to expense risks. The rate may be increased in the future but is guaranteed never to exceed 1.25%. The charge may be a
source of profit for Banner Life which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment
of distribution, sales and other expenses. Banner Life currently anticipates a profit from this charge.

10. The mortality risk arises from Banner Life's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined in
accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long all Annuitants
or any individual Annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity, nor an
improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments that the Annuitant will
receive under a Contract. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit guarantee because
it could exceed the Account Value.

11. The expense risk assumed by Banner Life is that its actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered
through the administrative charges.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust,
its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit
any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself.

3. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit
the deduction from the assets of Account B of a maximum charge of 1.25% for the assumption of mortality and expense risks.
Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicants submit that Banner Life is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense
risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts is consistent with the
protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. The mortality and expense risk charge
is a reasonable charge to compensate Banner Life for the risks that: (a) Annuitants under the Contract will live longer
individually or as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (b)
the Account Value will be less than the Death Benefit; and (c) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts
derived from the administrative charges.

4. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon Banner Life's analysis of publicly available
information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels,
the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Banner Life will maintain at its administrative
offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of,
and the methodology and results of, its comparative review.

5. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. Banner Life has concluded
that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit Account
B and the Contract Owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Banner
Life at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.

6. Banner Life also represents that Account B will only invest in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors
or trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the company, formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion



For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Representations



1. The Fund is a registered investment company that currently offers three money market series: Prime Fund, U.s. Government
Securities Fund, and Treasury Fund. Each series may offer up to three classes of shares.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Adviser is the investment adviser of the Fund, and serves as custodian of the Fund's assets. Fund shares are distributed
by The 231 Broker-Dealer Services, Inc. (the ``Distributor''), and in the past were distributed by Concord Financial
Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Concord Holding Corporation, the parent of the Distributor.

</FOOTNOTE>


2. Applicants request that the order of exemption permit the Adviser, on behalf of each of the Portfolios it advisers,
to enter into repurchase transactions where, as further described below, the Adviser in certain circumstances would
co-invest with the Portfolio engaging in the transaction. No Portfolio would jointly enter into a repurchase agreement
with any other Portfolio.

3. An order to purchase Portfolio shares must be received by Supervised Service Company, Inc., the transfer agent,
prior to the determination of the net asset value of the Portfolio (the ``Determination Time'') to be executed on a
given day, except that purchase orders effected through the Adviser's computer system may be received by the Adviser,
in its capacity as custodian, as of the Determination Time. Purchase orders received after the Determination Time
will be executed the next business day. The Determination Time, which is also when the net income of a Portfolio is determined
and declared as a dividend to the shareholders of record, is 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time for the U.S. Government Securities
Fund and the Treasury Fund, and 3 p.m. Eastern Time for the Prime Fund. Orders for the purchase of shares of the Portfolios
are executed only when monies are available to the custodian by 4 p.m. Eastern Time for investment by the Portfolio.

4. Purchasers of Portfolio shares include, without limitation, individuals, businesses, and customers of the Adviser
or its affiliates that maintain customer-directed, non-discretionary accounts or discretionary accounts at the
Adviser or its affiliates. The Adviser, in accordance with its customers' standing orders, automatically will ``sweep''
excess cash balances from the customers' accounts by means of a computer system. The proceeds from the sweep program
will be held by the Adviser, as custodian, and will be available immediately for investment in Portfolio shares. The
total assets actually invested in the Portfolios through the sweep program, however, would not be known until the
machine processing required to process the Adviser's accounting system is completed (the ``Completion Time''),
which normally will not be later than 4 a.m. Eastern Time the following morning.

5. If a Portfolio were to accept orders from the Adviser through the sweep program without special agreements for investment
of the proceeds of these orders, dividends would be payable on shares purchased pursuant to such orders. The proceeds
of such orders, however, would remain uninvested overnight, and dividends to other shareholders of the applicable
Portfolio would be diluted. The requested relief would permit the Adviser to enter into repurchase transactions
on behalf of the Portfolios at the applicable Determination Time in an amount which it considers, based upon its experience
in administering its computer sweep program, to be sufficient to invest the net assets of the Portfolios attributable
to the operation of the sweep program that day. The exact amount of the repurchase transaction would not be known until
the Completion Time.

<TEXT>
 

6. The investment policies of the Portfolios permit each Portfolio to enter into repurchase agreement transactions
with financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers (each a ``Seller''). The Seller would not be the Adviser
or any other affiliated person of the Portfolio, or any affiliated person of such an affiliated person. On the day the
Seller and the Portfolio enter into a repurchase transaction, the applicable master agreement requires the Seller
to sell to the Portfolio and on the same day transfer to the Portfolio or applicable custodian the particular eligible
securities subject to the repurchase transaction against crediting the sale price of the securities to an account
of the Seller in immediately available funds. The particular eligible securities would be identified in and defined
by reference to that day's confirmation of the transaction. The Portfolios presently intend to use an agreement substantially
similar to the Master Repurchase Agreement developed by the Public Securities Association. At the time of the Seller's
transfer of securities to the Portfolio, the Seller is required to take action to perfect a security interest in favor
of the Portfolio in the transferred securities. Each repurchase agreement transaction will be ``collateralized
fully,'' as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7.
7. To the extent that the repurchase transaction was sufficient to make a Portfolio fully invested with respect to
its sweep funds, the Portfolio's records would reflect the specific amount it had in fact invested in the transaction.
If the repurchase transaction was not sufficient to make the Portfolio fully invested with respect to its sweep funds,
the Portfolio's records would reflect its investment in the entire amount of the repurchase transaction, and the
Adviser would retain an uninvested cash position with respect to funds in excess of the agreement. Any amounts invested
by the Adviser that exceed amounts available for reinvestment will be deemed to have been purchased by the Adviser
for its own account. Because of its experience and relationships with its customers, the Adviser normally has the
ability to predict accurately the amount of the sweep funds and normally would enter into a transaction in an amount
greater than its estimated proceeds from the sweep.
8. Until the Completion Time, the Portfolio would have a perfected security interest in all of the transferred securities.
However, only those specific securities described in the trade ticket confirming the amount of the transaction that
the Portfolio in fact had entered into with its own assets, which would be prepared the next day by the Adviser, as custodian,
would be subject to the transaction. The Adviser also would confirm the amount, if any, that the Adviser had purchased
with its own funds.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Apart from the different amounts of the repurchase transactions, the terms of the transactions and the confirmation
of the allocation to the Portfolio and the Adviser would be identical.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
As a matter of practice, the Sellers issue confirmations for the repurchase transactions on the same day as the transaction.
Therefore, the confirmation will not show the allocation of the repurchase transactions between the Adviser and
the Portfolios. In order to create a written record of the dollar amounts allocated to the Portfolios and the specific
securities purchased by the Portfolios, the Adviser would issue a trade ticket on the next business day, after the
facts are known.
</FOOTNOTE>


9. Ordinarily, each repurchase transaction effected with sweep funds would be secured by one issue of Treasury notes
or other securities. To the extent that any repurchase transaction is secured by two or more issues of securities differing
as to quality, maturity, or rate, each security will be apportioned between the Portfolio and the Adviser 

pro rata

 to the extent possible. Where such apportionment is not possible, securities will be apportioned in a manner that
the Adviser believes will leave each party in a comparably secured position.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Section 17(d) makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as principal,
to effect any transaction in which such registered investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant
with such affiliated person in contravention of such rules and regulations as the SEC may prescribe. Rule 17d&hyph;1
provides that, in passing upon applications for an exemption from section 17(d), the SEC will consider whether the
participation of the registered investment company in the joint enterprise, joint arrangement, or profit-sharing
plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which
such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants.
2. Applicants acknowledge that, to the extent that assets of the Adviser, as an affiliated person of a Portfolio, are
used with those of a Portfolio to enter into repurchase transactions, they may be deemed to be participating in a joint
arrangement or joint enterprise prohibited by the Act. Applicants contend that a Portfolio's participation in the
proposed transactions will not be on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of the Adviser.
3. Applicants contend that the proposed procedure for helping to ensure that the Portfolio is fully invested provides
only benefits and no disadvantages to shareholders. The Portfolio's rights 

vis-a-vis

 Sellers under repurchase transactions will be protected by a standard industry agreement. In addition, the Portfolios
will comply with the SEC's position concerning repurchase agreements set forth in Investment Company Act Release
Nos. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) and with other existing and future positions taken by the SEC or its staff by rule, interpretive
release, no-action letter, any release adopting any new rule, or any release adopting any amendments to any existing

</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Dennis M. O'Connell, Director, Office of Tariff and Trade Affairs, Office of the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement),
(202) 622&hyph;0220.



Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. I (1962), and section 9503(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;203), the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement) announces the renewal of the following
advisory committee:




Title: 

The Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service.



Purpose: 

The purpose of the Committee is to present advice and recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding commercial
operations of the U.S. Customs Service and to submit a report to Congress containing a summary of its operations and
its views and recommendations.




Statement of Public Interest: 

It is in the public interest to continue the existence of the Committee upon expiration, under the provisions of the
Advisory Committee Act, of its current two-year term. The Committee provides a critical forum for distinguished
representatives of diverse industry sectors to present their views on major issues involving commercial operations
of the Customs Service. These views are offered directly to senior Treasury and Customs officials on a regular basis
in a candid atmosphere. There exists no other single body that serves a comparable function.


</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;203), Congress repealed the statutory mandate
for a Customs User Fee Advisory Committee and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to create a new Advisory Committee
on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service. The original Committee consisted of 20 members drawn broadly
from industry sectors affected by Customs commercial operations. The Committee's charter was filed on October 17,
1988 and expired two years later. A new charter was filed on October 17, 1990, renewing the Committee for an additional
two-year term. A third charter was filed on October 15, 1992, renewing the Committee for another two-year term, and
the Committee has met quarterly thereafter. The current term of the Committee will end with the expiration of the current
chapter on October 15, 1994. The Treasury Department plans to file a new charter by that date renewing the Committee
for a fourth two-year term.



Objectives, Scope and Description of the Committee



The Committee's objectives are to advise the Secretary of the Treasury on issues relating to the commercial operations
of the Customs Service. It is expected that, during its third two-year term, the Committee will consider such issues
as implementation of the Customs Modernization Act, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the recent GATT
agreement; user fees; administration of staff and resources for commercial operations; commercial and trade enforcement;
impact of Customs commercial operations on ports and carriers; automated systems; Customs reorganization; and
the President's ``reinvention of government'' initiative.

The Committee will be chaired by the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement. The Committee will function
for a two-year period before renewal or abolishment and will meet approximately eight times (quarterly) during the
period. An additional special meeting of the full Committee or a subcommittee thereof may be convened if necessary.
The meetings will generally be held in the Treasury Department, Washington, DC. However, typically one meeting per
year, but generally not more than two, may be held outside of Washington at a Customs port. In recent years, meetings
have been held in New York, San Diego, Miami, Buffalo, El Paso, and Chicago.

The members shall be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury from representatives of the trade or transportation
community serviced by Customs, the general public, or others who are directly affected by Customs commercial operations.
In addition, members shall represent major regions of the country, and not more than ten members may be affiliated
with the same political party. No person who is required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an
agent or representative of a foreign principal may serve on an advisory committee. Members shall not be paid compensation
nor shall they be considered Federal Government employees for any purpose. No per diem, transportation, or other
expenses are reimbursed for the cost of attending Committee meetings at any location.

Members who are serving on the Committee during its expiring two-year term are eligible to reapply for membership.
A new application letter and updated resume are required. It is expected that approximately half of the current membership
of the Committee will be replaced with new appointees.

Membership on the Committee is personal to the appointee. Under the Committee By-laws, a member may not send an alternate
to represent him at a Committee meeting. However, since Committee meetings are open to the public, another person
from a member's organization may attend and observe the proceedings in a nonparticipating capacity. Regular attendance
is essential; a member who is absent for two consecutive meetings or two meetings in a calender year shall lose his seat
on the Committee.



Application for Advisory Committee Appointment



Any interested person wishing to serve on the Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs
Service must provide the following:




_Statement of interest and reasons for application;

_Complete professional biography or resume;

_Political affiliation, in order to ensure balanced representation. (Mandatory. If no party registration, indicate
``independent'' or ``unaffiliated''). 




In addition, applicants must state in their applications that they agree to submit to preappointment security and
tax checks. There is no prescribed format for the application. Applicants may send a cover letter describing their
interest and qualifications and enclosing a resume.

The application period for interested candidates will extend to July 15, 1994. Applications should be submitted
in sufficient time to be received by the closing date to the Director, Office of Tariff and Trade Affairs, Office of
the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement)), Room 4004, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington,
DC 20220.

Funding Availability for FY 1994; 
Invitation for Applications: Public Housing Development 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development; invitation for applications.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit
applications for public housing development. Applications are limited to: 


(1) Replacements for demolition/disposition subject to section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA);

(2) Replacements for homeownership transfers under the HOPE I Program, and homeownership sales under section 5(h)
of the USHA; 
(3) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts; and 
(4) ``Other'' applications. 
All successful applicants will be required to participate in the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, unless
granted an exception. This NOFA also provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications.
The Department is also encouraging applicants to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative arrangements
with community-based entities to provide housing, and is encouraging PHAs to engage in ``mixed income'' development
(wherein public housing units are integrated within market-rate developments). This is being done by providing
additional points for such efforts (see sections III.E.5 and IV.E. of this NOFA). 

This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Applications are due at the HUD Field Office on or before 4 p.m., local time, on July 8, 1994. See Section III of this NOFA
for further information on application submission. If an application is mailed to the Field Office, the PHA must clearly
write ``PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION'' on the outside of the envelope and obtain a return receipt indicating
the date and time of delivery. Hand delivered applications shall be date/time stamped and initialed by the employee
receiving the application upon delivery. 


The application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all applicants, HUD will not consider
any application that is received after the deadline. PHAs should take this into account and submit applications as
early as possible to avoid risk brought about by unanticipated delays or delivery-related problems. In particular,
PHAs intending to mail applications must provide sufficient time to permit delivery on or before the deadline date.
Acceptance by a Post Office or private mailer does not constitute delivery. Facsimile (Fax), COD, and postage due
applications will not be accepted.

I. Introduction 



A. Authority



Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); and section 7(d) of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). 

Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941; demolition/disposition regulations are
published at 24 CFR part 970; section 5(h) regulations are published at 24 CFR part 906. 

The interim and final regulations for the public housing FSS program were published on May 27, 1993, at 58 FR 30858,
and 58 FR 30906, respectively, and will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. (The FSS final rule simply adopts the FSS interim
rule as the FSS final regulations.) 

The Notice of Program Guidelines for the HOPE&hyph;1 program was published on January 14, 1992 at 57 FR 1522. The Catalog
of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850. 



B. Fund Availability



The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million
of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP)
under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior
year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available
amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the
Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to
public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover. 

In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved
October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000
depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000
(depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled
families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department. 

The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the
amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000)
has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or
section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department
will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared. 

The following table illustrates the distribution of grant authority.

C. Fund Assignments



Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable
of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums. 



1. Headquarters Reserve



Threshold-approvable applications for housing resulting from unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural
and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters;
housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts shall
be assigned Headquarters Reserve funding. (Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section
104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;235, approved December
15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the
HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution
of grant authority shown above.) 



2. Fair Share



Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These
fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors,
which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies,
amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions. 

Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia
Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia,
fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts
provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications.
The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process.
If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other
applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among
remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications. 

Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that
not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated
for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications
may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory
requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)).

3. Non-Fair Share



Thirty percent of the appropriated amount, up to $150 million, will be made available for applications for replacement
housing subject to section 18 of the USHA. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable applications for
replacement units for HOPE 1 or section 5(h) homeownership transfers or sales. 



4. Remaining Balances



Any residual funds not reserved under categories 1, 2, and 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other''
approvable applications. 



D. Conformity to Regulations and NOFA Requirements



While conformity with 24 CFR part 941 is required, this funding effort is also subject to the additional specific requirements,
consistent with the regulations, that are set forth in this NOFA. Applicants also should consult Handbook 7417.1
REV&hyph;1, the FY 1994 detailed Processing Notice, and the FSS interim and final regulations published on May 27,
1993 at 58 FR 30858 and 58 FR 30906, respectively, which will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. The selection criteria specified
in this NOFA may not be added to or modified. 



II. Application Process Overview 



A. General



All applications shall be submitted to the appropriate Field Office by the application deadline date. The Field Office
shall screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA a 14-day opportunity to furnish missing technical
information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will then be subjected to a ``pass/fail''
threshold examination. Approvable category 1, 2, and 3 applications will be reported to Headquarters for further
action. 

Category 4 passing applications will be forwarded for rating to Rating Panel(s). One or more Rating Panels, comprised
of HUD Field representatives appointed by Headquarters, shall be convened for the purpose. Category 4 applications
will be rated by the Rating Panel(s) based on Field Office analyses. Headquarters will determine the funds required
to approve category 1, 2, and 3 applications and select category 4 applications based on Rating Panel ratings and recommendations.




B. Categories of Applications



Each application must be for one of the following categories: 

1. Replacement units for demolition/disposition approvals, subject to section 18 of the USHA (Category 1) 

2. Replacement units for HOPE I or section 5(h) home-ownership transfers or sales (Category 2); 

3. Public housing to be funded from Headquarters Reserve (Category 3); or 

4. ``Other'' development applications intended to increase the public housing stock (Category 4). Category 4 applicants
are limited to no more than one application per locality. 



C. Application Approval



1. Up to the available amount for category 1 applications (see section I.B. of this NOFA) and all category 3 approvable
applications will be funded. 

2. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable category 2 applications. 

3. Category 4 (other) applications will be funded up to the fair share amounts for each Area. 

4. Funds not required for categories 1, 2, or 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other'' approvable applications.




D. Disclosure of Information



The Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) prohibits advance disclosure
of funding decisions (see 24 CFR part 4); civil penalties related to advance disclosure are set out in 24 CFR part 30.
Application approval/non-approval notifications shall not occur until the Congressional notification process
is completed. 



E. Records Retention



Applications and materials related to applications (e.g., Field Office analyses, application scoring sheets,
and notifications of selection/non-selection) will be retained in the appropriate Field Office for five years,
and be available for public inspection in accordance with 24 CFR part 12. 



III. Application Requirements 



A. All Applicants



Each application must specify the housing type (new construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition), development
method (conventional, turnkey, or acquisition), and community for which the project is proposed. No more than one
housing type, development method, and locality may be proposed for an application. Each application shall consist
of an original and two copies, and must include the following: 



1. Cover Letter



 The cover letter must identify the category of application (see section II.B. of this NOFA for a description of the
categories; see also subparagraph 6 of section III.A of this NOFA). 



2. Application-Form HUD 52470



The application must be signed by the person authorized and dated and include the information as specified in the form.




3. Evidence of Legal Eligibility



If it has not previously done so, the PHA must document that it is legally organized. A current General Certificate
(Form HUD 9009) must be submitted. 



4. Cooperation Agreement (Form HUD 52481)



The PHA must document that the number of units requested, along with units in management and other units in development,
are covered by Cooperation Agreements.

<TEXT>
 

5. PHA Resolution In Support of the Application (Form HUD&hyph;52471) 



Under this resolution, the PHA agrees to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941 (see also paragraph 6 of this
section III.A). By executing the PHA Resolution, the PHA also certifies that it will comply with Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131) and the implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35. 



6. Front-End Funds 



If front-end funds are being requested, the PHA must so state in its cover letter; should the PHA desire the project
only if front-end funds can be approved, the PHA must so state. The Form HUD&hyph;52471 (PHA Resolution) must refer
to the request, and include Form HUD&hyph;52472 (Local Governing Body Resolution/Transcript of Proceedings) approving
the request. 



7. Drug-Free Workplace 



The PHA must submit the Certification for a Drug-Free Workplace (Form HUD&hyph;50070) in accordance with 24 CFR 24.630.




8. Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreement (Form HUD&hyph;50071) 



In accordance with section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year
1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87, the PHA must certify
that no federally appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the PHA for influencing or attempting
to influence an officer or employee of any agency, or a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal
contract, the making of any Federal grant or loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension,
continuation, renewal, amendment, or modifications of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.




9. Form SF&hyph;LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities 



Also in accordance with the Byrd Amendment and the regulations at 24 CFR part 87, the PHA must complete and submit Form
SF&hyph;LLL if funds other than federally appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid by or on behalf of the PHA
for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, or a member of Congress in connection
with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal grant or loan, the entering into of any cooperative
agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modifications of any Federal contract, grant,
loan, or cooperative agreement. 



10. Disclosure of Government Assistance and Identity of Interested Parties (Form HUD 2880) 



The PHA must submit the Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report (Form HUD&hyph;2880) in accordance with
the requirements of 24 CFR part 12, subpart C. 



11. Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) 



Section 23 of the USHA requires PHAs that are awarded new public housing units to implement an FSS program. Applicants
must certify that they will comply with 24 CFR part 962, which requires successful applicants to initiate or expand
an FSS program for the number of families that equals the total number of units they have been awarded (unless otherwise
excepted). 



B. Applications for New Construction 



In accordance with section 6(h) of the USHA, new construction may be engaged in only if the PHA demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Secretary that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA determines the housing is needed
is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation in such neighborhood. Therefore, every application
for a new construction project (conventional or turnkey) must be accompanied by either the information described
in paragraphs B.1 and B.3 of this section, or, at the applicant's option, the information described in paragraphs
B.2 and B.3 of this section: 

1. A PHA comparison of the costs of new construction (in the neighborhood where the PHA proposes to construct the housing)
and the costs of acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation in the same neighborhood (including estimated
costs of lead-based paint testing and abatement); or 

2. A PHA certification, accompanied by supporting documentation, that there is insufficient existing housing in
the neighborhood to develop housing through acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation; and 

3. A statement that: 

(a) Although the application is for new construction, the PHA will accept acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation,
if HUD determines the PHA cost comparison or certification of insufficient housing does not support approval of new
construction; or 

(b) The application is for new construction only. (In any such case, if HUD cannot approve new construction under section
6(h) of the USHA, the application will be rejected.) 



C. Replacement Housing Applications 



1. Cover Letter 



For both category 1 and category 2 applications, the cover letter must state whether the demo/dispo or transfer/sale
application (to demolish/dispose of units, or to transfer/sell units) (hereinafter referred to as the ``underlying
application'') has been approved; the date of approval; the project number and the name of the project being replaced;
and whether it is being replaced in whole or in part. If the underlying application was not approved at the time the replacement
housing application is filed, the cover letter must state the date the underlying application was submitted for consideration.
Category 1 or 2 applications will not be funded unless the underlying application is approved by the time funding selections
are made. 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify that the units requested are specifically required in FY 1994 either to meet the one-for-one replacement
requirement of section 18 of the USHA to replace public housing demolition/disposition; or to meet the requirements
of section 304(g) of the USHA to replace existing public housing approved in FY 1994 or earlier for homeownership transfer
under HOPE 1, or for sale under section 5(h) of the USHA. 



3. Replacement Application Under Section 18 



A PHA submitting a replacement housing application under section 18 (category 1) must demonstrate that the replacement
units, alone or together with other identified replacement units: 

a. Will implement the PHA's Replacement Housing Plan submitted and approved under 24 CFR 970.11; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-2-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Are for no fewer units (or portion thereof approved by HUD) than the number of units to be demolished or disposed of;
and 

c. Will house at least the same number of individuals and families that could be served by the housing to be demolished
or disposed. 



D. Applications for Units To Be Funded From Headquarters Reserve



1. Cover Letter



A PHA submitting a category 3 application shall identify the purpose of the application (see section I.C.1 of this
NOFA). 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify that the units requested are required to comply with court orders or directions of the Secretary.
Court orders must be identified. 




E. ``Other'' Applications




Applicants are encouraged to review the rating criteria (IV.E.) to ensure rating factors have been addressed in the
application. ``Curable technical deficiencies'' (section IV.B. of this NOFA) relate only to items that would not
improve the substantive quality of applications relative to rating factors. A PHA may file only one application per
locality under this category. 



1. Cover Letter 



Applicants for ``other'' public housing development units (category 4), must state whether they will accept fewer
units than applied for. Refusal to accept fewer units may result in an application not being selected if funds are not
sufficient for the full number of units. 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify to one of the following, pursuant to section 5(j) of the USHA (select E.2.a or E.2.b.): 

a. The units requested (limited to 100 or fewer) are needed for family housing to satisfy demands not being met by the
section 8 existing or voucher rental assistance programs; or 

b. 85 percent of the PHA's dwelling units (select (1), (2), or (3)): 

(1) Are maintained in substantial compliance with the section 8 housing quality standards (24 CFR 882.109); or 

(2) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or 

(3) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted
in good faith under section 14 of the USHA (or a comparable State or local government program), and that there is a reasonable
expectation, as determined in writing by HUD, that such application would be approvable; or will be so maintained
upon completion of modernization under the Comprehensive Grant program. 



3. Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p) 



Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate
supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of
this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in section V.A.2 of this NOFA. 

a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This
data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended
that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications
under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (CHAS).) 

b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate
a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive); 

(1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing
not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result,
is experiencing low levels of demand); 

(2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households,
or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-2-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) The shortage of housing is resulting in rent increases exceeding those increases commensurate with rental housing
operating costs; and 
(4) A significant number or proportion of section 8 certificate/voucher holders are unable to find adequate housing
because of the shortage of rental housing, as evidenced by PHA data showing a lower-than-average percentage of units
under lease and a longer-than-average time required to find units (typically, less than 85 percent lease up within
60 days). 


4. Documentation to Demonstrate Need



The PHA must submit documentation, such as waiting list description or PHA vacancy rate data, to demonstrate need
for the proposed public housing, to assist the HUD Field Office in its determination of need and market in accordance
with section IV.C.8.b of this NOFA. 


5. Additional Rating Points



Category 4 (other) applications may obtain additional rating points (see section IV.E.8 of this NOFA) if the PHA furnishes
additional data regarding any of the following: 
a. ``

Partnerships.'' 

PHAs are encouraged to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative or contractual arrangements with community-based
entities for the purpose of developing housing so that the housing fits into the community and is seen as an integral
part of it. ``Community-based entities'' include private non-profit or for-profit entities with experience in
the development of low and moderate income housing, or that are skilled in the delivery of services to families who
are residents of public housing. ``Cooperative or contractual arrangements'' include those that will facilitate
development (including management of the units) that will enhance the long-term viability of the development; and
those arrangements that the PHA has for the delivery of services (such as child care, education, and economic opportunities)
made available to residents of public housing. The PHA should indicate who the entity (or entities) are, the qualifications
of the entity and its principals, and the role they play or will play in the development, management, or service delivery
process which will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community. Such cooperative arrangements require
substantive involvement by the non-PHA partner in at least one of the following areas: Design, management, site selection,
representation to the community, or service delivery. If the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds
to pay an entity for its role in the arrangement, a justification for sole-source contracting in accordance with 24
CFR 85.36(d)(4) must be provided for consideration by HUD. With respect to the delivery of services, costs for such
services are not eligible to be paid from public housing development funds. The PHA must also certify that its selection
of the cooperative entity (or entities) was in compliance with State and local law.

 

[Note: If State/local procurement requirements cannot be complied with before the application deadline date, the
PHA may submit a statement with its application indicating that it is in the process of arranging such a cooperative
relationship and certifying that such a relationship will comply with State and local law. In such case, within 60
days of the date of publication of this NOFA, the PHA must: (1) Identify the entity(ies) proposed to be part of the cooperative
relationship; (2) describe the qualifications of the entity(ies) and of its principals, and the role they will play
in the development, management, or service delivery process that will lead to better acceptance of public housing
in the community; (3) submit a justification for sole source contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) (if
the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds to pay the entity for its role in the cooperative arrangement),
and a certification that the selection of the entity(ies) was in compliance with State and local law.]

 

b. 

Mixed income development. 

In order to encourage the development of public housing in metropolitan areas that will be less identifiable as public
housing, PHAs are encouraged to develop units whereby public housing would be mixed with market-rate dwellings so
that they are indistinguishable. Specifically, in order to receive points for this factor, a PHA must propose to acquire
units in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at or above 80 percent of median, or to acquire
sites in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at or above 80 percent of median. 
c. 

Past compliance with section 3. 

The PHA may submit evidence that over the past five years it has met any commitments made under the provisions of section
3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C., 1701u), as amended from time to time, and the implementing
regulations for section 3 at 24 CFR part 135. If the PHA does not have development experience, it may instead submit
evidence related to such experience with the modernization program. 
d. 

Proposed compliance with section 3. 

The PHA may submit its goals for complying with section 3 employment and training with regards to the public housing
development application. 
e. 

Support for local initiatives. 

If the application proposes a project which, as evidenced by a letter from local officials, actively supports an area
of local initiative such as a Community Development Block Grant, urban revitalization, Empowerment Zone/Enterprise
Community, or other similar local activity, or includes a commitment for a donation to the project in the event it is
selected for funding, the PHA should describe the activity. 
f. 

Resident initiatives. 

If the PHA is working with residents to establish and/or foster resident empowerment activities (such as establishing
Resident Corporations or Resident Management Corporations), the activities should be described. 


F. Ineligible Applications



Applications for intermediate care facilities and nursing homes may not be approved under this NOFA. Applications
for housing designated for the disabled and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs and may not be
applied for under this NOFA. 


IV. Field Office Processing of Applications 


A. Submission of Applications



The cover letter of all applications must be marked with the date and time of receipt, along with the initials of the
Field Office employee accepting the application. Applications received after the date and time specified at the
beginning of this NOFA will be returned to the applicant. The PHA should obtain a ``Return receipt'' or similar evidence
of delivery when applications are delivered via other means (U.S. Mail, private mailing firms, etc.). 


B. Initial Screening



1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine
whether all information and exhibits have been submitted. 
a. If any application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be
advised in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the
missing or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. 
b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of a category
4 application, relative to the ranking factors. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-2-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. If Form HUD 52470 (Application) is missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively incomplete,
and therefore ineligible for further processing. If other forms are missing, such as Form HUD 50070 (Drug Free Workplace
Certification) or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature, or an unauthorized signatory on a submitted
form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency.
2. An application that does not meet the applicable threshold and NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency
period will be rejected from processing and determined to be unapprovable.
3. Applications proposing housing in areas also served by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) are subject to coordination
with FmHA to assure that assisted housing resources to be provided are not duplicative. The State FmHA office shall
be advised that an application for public housing has been received and is being considered for funding, and be provided
an opportunity to comment on the application.
4. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. The failure of the Field Office to
identify and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of failure to submit
a complete application.


C. Application Threshold Approvability


After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, complete applications will be examined
for threshold approvability. Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be rejected from processing
and determined to be unapprovable. All applications for public housing development funds must meet the following
thresholds to be determined approvable:
1. The PHA may not have any litigation pending which would preclude approval of the application. The PHA must be legally
eligible to develop, own, and operate public housing under the USHA and have:
a. Approved and current PHA organization documents;
b. Local cooperation agreements to cover units under management, in development, and the units requested (Form HUD
52481), and any other required local authority;
c. A properly executed and complete PHA Resolution (Form HUD 52471), referring to the need for front-end funding,
if requested, and a Local Governing Body Resolution (HUD 52472) which approves the request for front-end funds, if
front-end funds are requested.



(

Note: 

By executing the PHA Resolution, the PHA certifies that it will comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (42 U.S.C. 12131) and the implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35. The PHA Resolution also certifies to the PHA's
intent to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941. These requirements include: Nondiscrimination under the
applicable civil rights laws; the requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655); the accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 135.)



2. The category of application is eligible under this NOFA (see section II.B of this NOFA).
3. If new construction (conventional or turnkey) has been applied for, the PHA has provided a cost comparison or a certification
with documentation (see section III.B. of this NOFA), and has stated what is to be done with the application if new construction
is not approvable.
4. No application shall be determined to be approvable if the PHA has failed to return excess advances received during
development or modernization, or amounts determined by HUD to constitute excess financing based on a HUD-approved
Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) or Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC), unless HUD has approved
a pay-back plan.
5. There are no environmental factors, such as sewer moratoriums, precluding development in the requested locality.
6. The following certifications are included in the application and have been executed by the appropriate person(s):
a. Form HUD&hyph;50070, Drug-Free Workplace;
b. Form HUD&hyph;50071, Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreements;
c. Form SF&hyph;LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, if applicable;
d. Form HUD&hyph;2880, Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report;
e. FSS certification;
f. Section 5(j) certification appropriate to the category of application.
7. The PHA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A PHA will be considered
to be in compliance if:
a. As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil
rights laws unless the PHA is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct
the areas(s) of noncompliance;
b. There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual,
unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s)
of noncompliance;
c. There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;
d. There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the PHA by the Department of Justice; or
e. There is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the PHA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of
the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400.
8. For ``other'' applications only:
a. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability to develop and manage the proposed housing.
The Field Office shall determine capability based upon the PHA's overall score under the Public Housing Management
Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), the PHA's most recent fiscal audit, and outstanding HUD monitoring
findings. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no
recent experience in developing or managing public/assisted housing.
b. The Field Office must determine that there is a need and a market for the proposed household type and bedroom sizes,
taking into consideration the documentation submitted by the PHA on housing supply and demonstration of need, any
local plans, and other assisted housing (e.g., HUD or FmHA) existing and proposed (including housing funded but not
completed).


D. Threshold Approvable Applications


Applications in categories 1, 2, and 3 will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the threshold review.
Threshold-approvable applications in category 4 (``other'') will be reviewed and analyzed by the Field Office.

V. Rating Panels 


A. Rating Panels


1. General


The Rating Panel(s) shall ensure that all category 4 applications have been properly determined to be threshold-approvable.
The Rating Panel(s) shall compile data furnished by Field Offices for category 4 (other) applications, and rate each
application based on Field Office analyses, comments, and recommendations. 
A list of rated applications shall be forwarded to Headquarters, with copies of Field Office reviews and recommendations,
and justifications for Rating Panel rankings. Headquarters shall not modify ratings of category 4 (``other'') applications
unless a gross error has occurred. 

Examples of ``gross errors'' include, but are not limited to, errors in calculating the vacancy rate in the proposed
community, or assigning points for development/management experience based on a PHMAP score that was successfully
appealed, or simple errors of arithmetic. 

Changes in ratings shall be fully documented, and a copy of the memorandum authorizing the change (and the basis thereof)
shall be sent to the Rating Panel and to the Field Office for inclusion in the file and be made available for public inspection.
Category 4 applications shall be approved within Areas, to the extent fair share funds are assigned, as follows: 



2. ``Tight Market'' Determination



Headquarters will separate ``other'' applications (category 4) on the basis of ``tight rental housing market''
and Rating Panel ratings and Headquarters rankings, and approve them (in the following order) to the extent fair share
funds are assigned to their respective Area: 
a. Applications within the same Area in tight rental housing markets which receive 80 or more rating points; 
b. All other applications in the same Area, in rank order, depending on ``metropolitan'' or ``non-metropolitan''
funding available. 


B. Reservation of Funds


Funds will be reserved in an amount equal to the total development cost limit for the number, structure type, and size
of units being approved, ``trended'' to take into consideration the anticipated cost of construction at the time
the construction/rehabilitation contract is expected to be executed; acquisition reservations will be trended
to take into account anticipated cost variations between fund reservation and Date of Full Availability (DOFA).
The trend shall be calculated by multiplying the project total development cost limit by 6 percent (1.06), rounded
to the nearest $50. No amendment funds will be available for these projects in the future. 


C. Partial Funding


Partial funding of highly ranked ``other'' applications within an Area may occur (so long as such projects are determined
viable and the PHA has indicated willingness to accept fewer units) to facilitate the funding in rank order of additional
applications for highly ranked projects.

VII. Other Matters 


A. Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. 



B. Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship
with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of
government. The NOFA will provide PHAs with funding for public housing development. 



C. Family Impact



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions
of this NOFA do not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
within the meaning of the Order. To the extent that the funding provided through this NOFA results in additional or
improved housing, the effects on the family will be beneficial. 



D. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. (See section II of this NOFA.) These authorities prohibit recipients
of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches
of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the
awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.




E. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in appendix
A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. 



F. Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act of 1989



A final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 7, 1993, amended the definition of ``person'' to exclude from coverage a State or local government, or
the officer or employee of a State or local government or housing finance agency thereof who is engaged in the official
business of the State or local government. 
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD).
This is not a toll-free number. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.




G. Prohibition Against Advance Disclosure of Funding Decisions



Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the
making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other
than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the
subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202)
708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) 



H. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance



HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 12 implement section 102 of the HUD Reform Act. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered
by HUD. The following requirements concerning documentation and public access disclosures are applicable to assistance
awarded under this NOFA. 



1. Documentation and Public Access



HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 



2. Disclosures



HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports, both applicant disclosures and updates,
will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (52 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a notice of availability of Federal funds for the Consortia of American Businesses in the Newly Independent
States (CABNIS) program to assist U.S. firms in establishing a commercial presence in the former Soviet Union. CABNIS
is a program designed to assist U.S. firms in establishing a commercial presence in the Newly Independent States of
the former Soviet Union (NIS). Through CABNIS funding, non-profit organizations form business consortia to promote
the sale of U.S. goods and services in the NIS. The participants in such CABNIS consortia are for-profit U.S. firms
interested in trade with the NIS. CABNIS recipients establish consortia offices and staff in the NIS to provide a broad
range of services for their for-profit member firms, including market research; sales promotion; communication
of sales, joint venture and investment opportunities; identification of and introduction to potential buyers and
trade contacts; staging trade and technical missions and seminars; provision or arrangement of necessary legal
services; and other export trade facilitation services. Through the CABNIS program, Federal funds are awarded as
seed money to help pay the start-up costs of establishing and operating U.S. consortia offices in the NIS. A CABNIS
consortium can be organized along a single industry line or represent more than one business sector. There is no limitation
on the number of for-profit firms that a consortium may represent.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 






Program Authority:

 Section 303(b)(4) of the FREEDOM Support Act, 22 U.S.C. 5823(b)(4). 






Program Objectives:

 CABNIS consortia are intended to strengthen the U.S. business presence in the NIS. They will provide direct trade
facilitation support for their member firms, stimulating increased U.S. exports to the NIS. The consortia will be
expected to support host country private sector development through assistance with finding markets for NIS products,
promoting U.S. investment and U.S.&hyph;NIS joint ventures, providing technical training, and/or identifying
and assisting with defense plant conversion projects. 




Funding Availability:

 Funding for the program will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration
(ITA). The total amount of ITA Federal assistance funds available for CABNIS is $1.5 million for FY 1994. Commerce
anticipates awarding a minimum of three awards prior to the end of FY 1994. 




Funding Instrument and Project Duration:

 The funding instrument will be a grant. The Federal funding contribution will not exceed 50 percent of proposed allowable
project costs with a maximum funding amount of $500,000 per grantee. Applicants must commit non-Federal resources
(cash and/or in-kind contribution) to match the remaining share of project costs. The award period will be up to three
years. 



Eligibility:

 Eligible applicants for Federal assistance through the CABNIS program are private and public non-profit U.S. organizations
that will represent the commercial interests of U.S. firms in furthering trade and economic relations with the NIS.
Applicants should be able to show that there exists within the organization proven experience in trade and economic
relations with the NIS. Only applicants proposing to open an office in one or more of the following Newly Independent
States are eligible for CABNIS assistance: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. 


Membership in a consortium must be available on a non-discriminatory basis. For example, membership in a trade association
cannot be a requirement for membership in a consortium. 



Selection Procedures:

 Each application will receive an independent, objective review by one or more review panels qualified to evaluate
the applications submitted under the program. The review panel(s) will evaluate all applications on a competitive
basis, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below, and make award recommendations to the Selecting Official.
A minimum of six weeks will be necessary to complete the evaluation process. 


Awards will not necessarily be made to the highest ranked applicant. The Selection Official shall recommend awards
based on the ranking of applications as determined by the review panel(s), geographic distribution among those NIS
countries identified by CABNIS, distribution among industry sectors, and the availability of funds. Preference
may also be given to private non-profit applicants. 




Evaluation Criteria:

 Consideration for financial assistance will be given to those CABNIS proposals that: 


1. Demonstrate a realistic work plan detailing how the consortium will assist proposed U.S. member firms to promote
and/or market their products and services in the NIS. Examples of the types of services that a consortium can provide
include advertising and publicity, conducting technical and sales seminars, communicating business opportunities,
identifying potential buyers and distributors, conducting market research, etc. 
Evidence of marketability of the U.S. products and/or services to be marketed in the NIS will be taken into account
in evaluating applications. 


2. Demonstrate a well-reasoned plan as to how the consortium will support private sector development in the NIS (e.g.,
through product marketing assistance, technical training, investment promotion, identifying and assisting with
defense conversion projects, working with or helping to form indigenous counterpart trade organizations [such
as trade associations], etc.). Evidence that the consortia activities in the NIS will 
be related to the proposed U.S. member firms' exports will be taken into account in evaluating applications (e.g.,
a consortium representing U.S. suppliers of medical equipment and supplies may choose to work with host country industry
groups and arrange for training in western-style hospital administration and health services, bring technical
trade missions to the U.S., and/or encourage U.S.&hyph;NIS business ventures for the joint production of medical
equipment and supplies).

3. Are proposed by non-profit organizations with the 
capacity, qualifications and staff necessary to undertake successfully the intended activities. 

In addition, priority consideration will be given to applications that: 

4. Demonstrate the capability and intent of enlisting small and mid-sized U.S. firms as members of the consortium.


5. Provide a reasonable assurance that the proposed project can be continued on a self-sustained basis after expiration
of the Federal award. 

6. Present a reasonable and realistic, itemized budget for the proposed activities and reflect an appropriate balance
between program support (e.g., establishing a commercial office in the NIS, providing export trade services to U.S.
firms, conducting on-site conferences, seminars, etc.) and operational expenses (e.g., personnel salaries, consulting
fees, domestic travel, overhead, etc.). 

Evaluation criteria factors 1 through 3 will be weighted equally and will take precedence over priority consideration
factors 4 through 6. Priority consideration factors 4 through 6 will be weighted equally. 

The Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union share a demand for U.S. equipment, instrumentation, services,
and technology (e.g., products, services and
