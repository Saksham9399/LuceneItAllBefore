ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing that a public meeting will be held to discuss
an environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact prepared for a determination of nonregulated
status for a genetically engineered virus-resistant squash line designated ``ZW&hyph;20 squash.'' APHIS will
be accepting public comments on the environmental assessment. APHIS has previously requested public comments on
any plant pest risk issues presented by the ZW&hyph;20 squash. The environmental assessment and preliminary finding
indicate no significant impact on the environment from the determination that the ZW&hyph;20 squash does not present
a plant pest risk and should no longer be regulated under APHIS' regulations. Based on this preliminary finding of
no significant impact, APHIS has determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared for the issuance
of this determination.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The public meeting will be held in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 4 p.m.
local time. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before 
July 7, 1994, regarding the environmental assessment.

 
</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 The public meeting will be held in the Jefferson Auditorium, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), South
Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC. The following documents may be inspected at USDA,
room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 4, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a notice of proposed interpretive
ruling (57 FR 40632&hyph;40633, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1) in response to a petition from the Upjohn Company
(Upjohn), Kalamazoo, MI, for a determination of regulatory status of its ZW&hyph;20 virus-resistant squash line.
After considering the comments submitted during the 30-day comment period, APHIS determined that it was in the public
interest to reopen the comment period to examine scientific 
issues raised by the commenters. A notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), requesting additional information on eight issues
raised by respondents to Docket No. 
92&hyph;127&hyph;1. On March 31, 1993 (58 FR 17044&hyph;17059, Docket No. 92&hyph;156&hyph;2), APHIS amended
its regulations in 7 CFR part 340 by establishing a petition process. The petition process allows for a determination
that certain plants are no longer regulated articles, and formalizes the interpretive ruling procedure which was
in place when the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted. To provide for a thorough review of comments
and information submitted to APHIS on the ZW&hyph;20 squash, APHIS is convening a public meeting to provide a forum
for an open discussion of the issues analyzed in the environmental assessment. 


Procedures for the Public Meeting 


Any interested person may appear and may be heard in person, by attorney, or by other representative. The meeting will
be held in the Jefferson Auditorium, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), South Building, 14th Street
and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, on 
June 21, 1994, from 9 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. until 4 p.m., local time. However, the meeting may conclude
earlier if all persons who have requested an opportunity to speak have been heard. Persons who wish to speak should
register at the meeting location with the presiding officer before the meeting. Pre-meeting registration will begin
at 8 a.m., local time, on the day of the meeting at the meeting site. Persons who have registered will be heard in the order
of their registration. Attendees who do not register in advance will be allowed to speak after all scheduled speakers
have been heard. We ask that anyone who reads a statement provide two copies to the presiding officer at the meeting.
The presiding officer may limit the time for each presentation in order to allow everyone wishing to speak the opportunity
to be heard.

Environmental Assessment and Preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact



APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340, which were promulgated pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 150aa&hyph;150jj, 151&hyph;167,
and 1622n, and 31 U.S.C. 9701, regulate the introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into the
environment) of certain genetically engineered organisms and products. The regulations at &sect;340.6 provide
for a petition process for issuing a determination that certain plants that do not present a plant pest risk no longer
need to be regulated.

The crookneck squash (

Cucurbita pepo 

L. cultivar YC77E ZW&hyph;20)(ZW&hyph;20), developed by Upjohn, has been considered a regulated article under
7 CFR part 340, in part because it has been engineered with coat protein (CP) from watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV2) and
zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and in part because the vector system used to transfer viral CP genes into the
recipient squash was derived from the bacterial plant pathogen 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 

In addition, certain noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from plant pathogens, i.e., from 

A. tumefaciens 

and from cauliflower mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. Field tests of the ZW&hyph;20 squash have been conducted
under APHIS permits each year from 1990 through 1994 under conditions of reproductive confinement. The environmental
assessments (EAs) prepared by APHIS in conjunction with the issuance of permits for field tests of ZW&hyph;20 have
addressed various attributes of the squash line. The EA to be addressed at the public meeting examines the potential
environmental impacts that might be associated with the unconfined cultivation of ZW&hyph;20 squash, as requested
in the petition from Upjohn. The effect of a determination favorable to the petition would be that permits under the
regulations would no longer be required from APHIS for field testing, importation, or interstate movement of these
squash or their progeny. Importation of ZW&hyph;20 squash or seeds capable of propagation would still be subject
to restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notices at 7 CFR part 319. The findings that support a preliminary
finding of no significant impact on the environment from a determination that the ZW&hyph;20 squash would no longer
be a regulated article include the following:

1. Growing ZW&hyph;20 squash would present no significant increase in the development of new plant viruses as compared
to plants infected with both ZYMV and WMV2;

2. The ability of ZW&hyph;20 squash to resist infection by WMV2 and ZYMV should not lead to this squash becoming a weed
pest;

3. Pollination of free-living 

Cucurbita pepo 

(FLCP) plants by the ZW&hyph;20 squash is not likely to increase the weediness of any resultant progeny;

4. Introgression and maintenance of the virus resistance trait from 
ZW&hyph;20 squash into the gene pool of FLCP is unlikely. Based upon surveys of FLCP, the incidence of pathology or
disease resulting from infection by ZYMV or WMV2 is not high enough to result in a selective pressure that would maintain
the resistance genes in FLCP populations;

5. APHIS cannot identify any impacts on nontarget organisms recognized as beneficial from the unconfined cultivation
of ZW&hyph;20 squash; and

6. The release of ZW&hyph;20 squash from regulation would have no identifiable impact on agricultural commodities.

The environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance
with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).

ACTION: 

Revised notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the time the original 

Federal Register

 and local media announcements of our Notice of Intent were published (February 1, 1994, 59 FR 4680), the geographic
area to be addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS) had not been completely identified. The geographic
area to be included in the analysis for the EIS has now been decided by the Oregon/Washington Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) State Director and Forest Service Regional Forester. It will include all land east of the crest of the Cascade
Mountains in the States of Oregon and Washington managed by the Forest Service and the BLM. The areas being added include
lands managed by the BLM within the Vale, Lakeview, and Burns Districts in portions of Malheur, Harney, and Lake Counties
in southeast Oregon. The subject BLM managed lands are covered by the Northern Malheur, Southern Malheur, Andrews,
High Desert, and Warner Lakes Management Framework Plans, all of which may be amended or revised to incorporate the
new ecosystem management strategy and rangeland reform standards and guidelines. The entire BLM Prineville District
area in north central Oregon and all portions of the Baker Resource Area in northeastern Oregon will also be addressed
in the EIS.


It has also been decided to hold additional public meetings throughout this area for the purposes of identifying public
issues. These scoping meetings will be held in the following locations:




May 23, 1994


Walla Walla, Washington


May 24, 1994


Bend, Oregon, John Day, Oregon, Wenatchee, Washington


May 25, 1994

Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review
of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic of China. The review covers 15
Chinese producers/exporters and 32 third-country resellers for the period January 1, 1990, through December 31,
1990. Based on our analysis of the comments received, we determine the country-wide dumping margin for the People's
Republic of China to be 128.94 percent. Since none of the third-country resellers have demonstrated entitlement
to a separate rate for sales made during this period or review, they will receive the same rate as their suppliers in
the People's Republic of China.

or 482&hyph;3814 respectively.




Background


On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results (58 FR 69330)
of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on potassium permanganate from the People's Republic
of China (PRC) (49 FR 3898, January 31, 1984). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).



Scope of the Review


Imports covered by this review are shipments of potassium permanganate, an inorganic chemical produced in free-flowing,
technical, and pharmaceutical grades. During the review period, potassium permanganate was classifiable under
item 2841.60.0010 of the harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers 15 producers/ exporters and 32 third-country
resellers for the period January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1990.


Analysis of Comments Received


We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of the following respondents,
Zunyi Chemical Factory (Zunyi), Yue Pak Co. Ltd. (Yue Pak), He-Ro Chemicals, Ltd. (He-Ro), ICD (HK) Ltd, (ICD (HK))
and an interested party, Novachem, Inc. (Novahem), we held a public hearing on February 10, 1994. We received timely
comments from the above-named respondents, the above-named interested party, and the petitioner, Carus Chemical
Company.


Comment 1


Methodology: Zunyi and Novachem assert that, in this review, the Department should have provided them with an opportunity
to respond to a separate rates questionnaire specifically based on the test announced in Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (Sparklers) on May 6, 1991 rather than that based
on the separate rates criteria set forth in Iron Construction Casting from the People's Republic of China; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Castings) on January 24, 1991. Zunyi and Novachem assert that in Castings,
the Department stated ``Our determination that the PRC is a state-controlled economy in which all entities are presumed
to export under the control of the state leads us to question the application of multiple rates, absent a clear showing
of legal, financial and economic independence. Thus, we conclude that a single country-wide rate is application
for this case.'' Zunyi and Novachem contrast that with Sparklers, where the Department adopted the following position:
``We have determined that exporters in non-market economy countries are entitled to separate, company-specific
margins when they can demonstrate an absence of control by the central government, both in law and in fact, with respect
to exports. Evidence supporting, though not requiring, a finding of de jure absence of central control includes:
(1) An absence of restrictive stipulation associated with an individual exporter's business and export licenses;
(2) any legislative enactments decentralizing control of companies; or (3) any other formal measures by the government
decentralizing control of companies. De facto absence of central government control with respect to exports is based
on two prerequisites: (1) Whether each exporter sets its own export prices independently of the government and other
exporters; and (2) whether each exporter can keep the proceeds from its sales.''

Zunyi and Novachem assert that the application in this case of the test utilized in Castings is inappropriate for the
following reasons. First, since questionnaires were not issued until three months after the Sparklers decision
was rendered, Zunyi and Novachem maintain that reliance on an approach in place at time of initiation is inappropriate.
Second, Zunyi and Novachem state that the Court of International Trade (CIT) has directed the Department to apply
the Sparklers methodology in a remand of Castings, the very case on which the Department based its approach in this
review. Third, Zunyi and Novachem claim that in reviews being conducted during the same time period as this one, the
Department has utilized the methodology set forth in Sparklers. As an example, Zunyi and Novachem point to the 1988&hyph;1989
review of Shop Towels from the People's Republic of China, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,
56 FR 60,969 (Nov. 29, 1991), where the Department requested information after the preliminary determination to
determine whether the respondent qualified for a separate rate under the Sparklers criteria. Zunyi and Novachem
argue that not to issue a new separate rates questionnaire in this review would be arbitrary and capricious. Finally,
Zunyi and Novachem assert that it is within the capacity of the Department to change methodologies within reviews
and that, in light of the above claims, the Department should now issue a questionnaire based on the Sparklers test
to determine whether PRC respondents qualify for a separate rate.
Petitioner points out that the separate rates test set forth in Sparklers does not, in fact, constitute a new methodology,
but is merely a continuation and elaboration of that set forth in Castings. Furthermore, petitioner asserts that
respondents were on notice regarding what they were required to show to obtain a separate rate under Castings, since
that decision was cited in the petitioner's request for review and because the Department requested from them the
information needed to make a separate rate decision. Petitioner also notes that the remand of the Department's determination
in Castings was based on the fact that because the Castings test was not enunciated until the final results of that review,
respondents had not been given an opportunity to attempt to demonstrate their entitlement to a separate rate, even
under the Castings criteria (``a clear showing of legal, financial and economic independence''). Finally, petitioner
states that the Department has broad discretion in choosing methodologies, and that the choice of methodology may
vary on a case-by-case basis.


DOC Position

: The Department agrees with the petitioner. The Castings test and the methodology utilized in Sparklers and most
recently in Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China
(Silicon Carbide) 59 FR 22585 (May 2, 1994) require that producers and exporters in the PRC receive a single rate unless
it is clearly demonstrated that a particular entity is not subject to governmental control and therefore merits its
own rate. The test employed in Sparklers and Silicon Carbide built upon that used in Castings by outlining specific
criteria that we would consider in determining whether an entity had shown such autonomy. In this case, Zunyi did not
demonstrate adequately that it was free of governmental control under any of these tests.
Indeed, information on the record indicates that Zunyi was controlled by municipal authorities. For example, during
this period of review, Zunyi was subject to guidance from municipal authorities regarding output in terms of value
and production, and was not allowed to enter into contracts with foreign entities or to export directly. (See DOC Position
to Comment 2.)
Furthermore, the Department's use of a questionnaire based on the Castings test has not prejudiced respondents'
position. The respondents were on notice with respect to their burden of showing their independence from governmental
control if they desired to be given a separate rate. The supplemental questionnaire sent to Zunyi and other PRC entities
states: ``[I]f you feel that your client is entitled to a separate rate, submit for the record all documentation that
supports your client's claim of legal, financial, and economic independence.'' Furthermore, respondents were
specifically requested to provide information regarding their corporate organization, relationships with other
businesses, state-ownership, decision making processes, and corporate accounting information. In addition,
Part Two of Appendix V of the questionnaire, the section directed specifically to manufacturers, requested information
on production for export, relationships with exporters and how pricing decisions were made with them, pricing and
production methods in general, government policy directives affecting pricing and production quantity decisions,
and relevant regulatory systems. Thus, respondents have already been afforded an opportunity to provide whatever
information they feel may support their request for separate rates.

The fact that the Department's decision in Castings was remanded does not invalidate the fundamental approach outlined
therein. In that case, the CIT found that the Department had not made clear until its final determination that the respondents
had to demonstrate that they were not subject to governmental control to receive a separate rate. The CIT's decision
merely requires that respondents be put on notice that they have the burden of demonstrating their independence if
they wish to receive a separate rate. Respondents in this review were made aware of that burden, but were unable to establish
that they were in fact entitled to any separate rate.

Finally, the Department's decision to issue a Sparklers questionnaire to a respondent in the Shop Towels case does
not require that it do so in this case. In Shop Towels, the Department had found the sole responding PRC firm, an import/export
firm, to be independent of governmental control in a previous review and sought only to ascertain whether that determination
remained valid. The record in this review establishes that Zunyi did not meet the Sparklers standard for independence.
Moreover, as already noted, respondents in the present case were provided several opportunities to submit evidence
demonstrating lack of governmental control. Under these circumstances, we have determined that issuing a Sparklers
questionnaire in this review was not necessary.



Comment 2





Separate Rates for PRC Producers: 

Zuny and Novachem state that the preliminary results do not fairly represent the information already submitted by
Zunyi on the lack of state control and that Zunyi merits a separate rate. They assert that state ownership and state
control are two different things. Additionally, Zunyi notes that its response included the following information
which supported its claim that it functions autonomously. First, Zunyi is totally separate from the import-export
corporations with which it deals; second, the import-export corporations sign a purchase contract with Zunyi according
to a price agreed upon in a calculation made in U.S. dollars; third, Zunyi's selling prices are decided by the factory
according to cost and market; fourth Zunyi implemented a contract system in 1987; and fifth, Zunyi is autonomous in
terms of management and accounting, and assumes sole responsibility in paying taxes and for profits and losses. Based
on these assertions, Zunyi and Novachem claim that they have submitted enough information to merit a separate rate
for Zunyi, alleging that the Department did not ask for further information.


Petitioner argues that the evidence on the record indicates that Zunyi is not qualified to receive a separate rate,
and that the Department should make an adverse assumption on this issue due to Zunyi's failure to provide certain required
evidence to support its claim of independence.



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioner. Based on the totality of information on the record, we have determined that Zunyi is subject
to government control. First Zunyi is under the control of the Economic Commission of Zunyi City (the Commission),
and the Commission gave ``guiding instructions'' as to the ``planning of production in terms of value and quantity.''
Second, as a ``Zhongguo Faren'', Zunyi was not allowed by Chinese law to engage in contractual relations with foreign
entities, nor was it allowed to export directly. Instead, it was required to export through PRC import/export companies.
This point was specifically mentioned in the Sparklers test as a factor weighing against a finding of independence.
Furthermore, Zunyi did not provide copies of its financial statements despite our two requests for these, nor did
it provide the detailed information we requested regarding its ownership. Without this critical evidence, the Department
is unable to affirm that Zunyi is entitled to separate rate status, despite the assertions Zunyi makes in its case brief.

With respect to Zunyi and Novachem's claim that the Department should have asked for any information that was lacking,
the Department requested on more than one occasion critical information (

e.g., 

Zunyi's financial statements and specific information regarding ownership), and that information was not provided
by Zunyi. In addition, as noted above, the information on the record is sufficient for the Department to determine
that Zunyi did not possess the requisite independence to merit a separate rate.



Comment 3





Market Oriented Industry: 

Zunyi and Novachem assert that Zunyi operated under market conditions during the period of review and that the Department
should utilize local factor prices to determine foreign market value as outlined in the methodology announced in
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China,
56 FR 175 (September 10, 1991). At the minimum, they argue, the Department should base fair market value on a surrogate
economy other than Thailand.

DOC Position: 

Since the margin for this period is based on best information available, any questions as to which methodology would
have been used have we been able to calculate a margin are moot. Furthermore, the failure of the PRC Embassy in the United
States to respond to our inquiry regarding industry and market conditions in the PRC would, in any case, preclude us
from determining that market conditions existed in the PRC for this industry.



Comment 4





Separate Rates Under the Reseller Provision:

 Zunyi and Novachem urge the Department to reconsider the decision in its preliminary results of review that the Hong
Kong resellers do not qualify for separate rates under the intermediate country reseller provisions. Section 353.47
of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.47) calls for a separate rate to be calculated for an intermediate country
reseller if all of the following criteria are met:

(1) A reseller in an intermediate country purchases the merchandise from the producer,

(2) The producer does not know (at the time of the sale) the country to which the reseller intends to export the merchandise,

(3) The merchandise enters the commerce of the intermediate country but is not substantially transformed in that
country, and

(4) The merchandise is subsequently exported to the United States.

Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD(HK) argue that Hong Kong should be treated as the country from which the subject merchandise
was exported and they should be given separate rates under this provision, which allows for qualifying intermediate
country resellers to be assigned a margin based on a comparison between their above cost-of-production sales to the
United States and a fair market value based on the reseller's sales in its home country or a third country, rather than
the margin(s) of its supplier(s). With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, Yue Pak, He-Ro and ICD (HK) claim
that since they filed import/export declarations and paid fees applicable only to imports and exports, the merchandise
entered the commerce of Hong Kong, rather than merely being transshipped through Hong Kong. Furthermore, these parties
note that it is uncontested that the merchandise was not transformed between its manufacture in the PRC and its shipment
to the United States.

In refuting arguments raised by petitioner, these resellers argue that (1) the length of time that merchandise remains
in a third country should not be a basis for determining intermediate country reseller status, (2) the amount paid
in import/export fees should not be a criterion, (3) the term ``transshipment'' as used by Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK)
in the questionnaire responses does not refer to the statutory meaning of the term, and (4) the export provisions of
the Tariff Act cited by petitioner are not relevant to the construction of the reseller provision.

Yue Pak, He-Ro and ICD (HK) also argue that the Department's comparison of their sales and order-filling process to
the practices described in the final determination in Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, From the People's Republic
of China (Sulfur Dyes), 58 FR 7537 (February 8, 1993), is not appropriate because, ``unlike respondents herein, respondents
in Sulfur Dyes had separate procedures for handling merchandise which was destined to the United States as opposed
to merchandise that was sold in Hong Kong.''

With respect to the knowledge requirement, Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) state that the producers from whom they purchased
the subject merchandise had no knowledge of the ultimate destination of this merchandise. Producer Zunyi, on the
other hand, states that it knew, at the time of sale, the destination of the potassium permanganate it sold during the
period of review.

Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) also claim that, since in the PRC only import and export corporations had the legal capacity
to enter into ``foreign economic contracts'' during the period of review, purchasing from these entities rather
than from the producer/manufacturer should fulfill this requirement. Zunyi and Novachem also make this point. Finally,
these parties note that export of the merchandise to the United States is not at issue.

Petitioner argues that no reseller in this case meets the qualifications for a rate distinct from its producer(s)
under 19 CFR 353.47. Petitioner also notes that since the intermediate country reseller provision constitutes an
exception to the general rule that a reseller's rate is the rate of its supplier(s), the responding resellers have
the burden to showing that each prong of the testy is fully met.

With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, petitioners assert that the merchandise was merely transshipped
through Hong Kong and did not enter commerce there, noting that the questionnaire responses of Yue Pak, He-Ro, and
ICD (HK) describe circumstances involved in the sales of subject merchandise through the resellers which indicate
that the merchandise was never intended to enter the commerce of Hong Kong. Petitioner also cites the appraisement
provisions of the tariff laws to support its proposition that to ``enter commerce'' is a term of art that involves merchandise
which (1) is intended to be diverted into the commerce of a third country and was in fact diverted; (2) is not passing
through a third country enroute to a purchaser in a different country; (3) is not merely passing through a third country;
(4) is intended for consumption in the third country; and (5) is sold or offered for sale in the third country. In petitioner's
view, warehousing, and/or repackaging, and/or relabelling in a third country is not considered evidence that the
merchandise has entered the commerce of a country, unless there are other supporting factors. In addition, petitioner
contends that a decision as to whether merchandise ``enters the commerce'' of a country must include consideration
of whether or not the producer country receives any undue benefit by shipping through a third country.

With respect to the ``knowledge'' prong, petitioner asserts that resellers have not demonstrated that the producers
did not know the merchandise was destined for the United States. As evidence to the contrary, they note that U.S.-specific
labels were affixed to the merchandise in the PRC. Furthermore, petitioners note that Zunyi and Sinochem, the only
PRC parties that responded in this review, both stated in their questionnaire responses that they were aware that
some of their sales of potassium permanganate were destined for the United States.

Petitioner also points to the fact that the Hong Kong resellers did not purchase directly from the manufacturer or
producer. As mentioned above, export of the merchandise to the United States is not at issue.

Finally, petitioner urges that even if a reseller in this case had been able to demonstrate that it qualified for a separate
rate under the intermediate country reseller provision, Hong Kong or third country sales should not be used as the
basis of foreign market value for any reseller, since there is reason to believe that sales through Hong Kong are made
at below the cost of production.



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioner that none of the resellers have met the requirements for separate rates in this review.

With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, we have considered the totality of the circumstances in determining
whether it has been shown that this merchandise entered the commerce of Hong Kong before being shipped to the United
States. No isolated factor, such as whether import/export fees or duties were paid or whether the merchandise was
warehoused in Hong Kong was treated as controlling. Instead, we have evaluated all factors which may be relevant.

In this case, there are compelling indications that the merchandise was never intended to be offered for sale in Hong
Kong, and that it entered the territory of Hong Kong for the sole purpose of being shipped from there to the United States.
The questionnaire responses of Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) clearly and explicitly indicate the following order pattern.
First, a U.S. customer would place an order with a Hong Kong reseller for a certain quantity of potassium permanganate.
Then the Hong Kong reseller would place an order for the exact same quantity with the PRC import/export company. The
import/export company would then place an order with the manufacturer for the same exact quantity which was ultimately
shipped through Hong Kong to the United States. Thus, the record shows that throughout the entire procedure, the merchandise
was always intended only for the U.S. market.

The treatment of the merchandise in Hong Kong, while not controlling, is also consistent with the fact that these shipments
did not enter the commerce of Hong Kong. For example, Hong Kong law exempts from import/export declarations (and associated
fees) shipments consigned under ``through bills of lading'' only. The fact that the Hong Kong resellers paid import/export
fees suggests only that the merchandise was not shipped under a ``through bill of lading''. In addition, the fact that
the Hong Kong resellers performed ``various tasks'' in Hong Kong in relation to the merchandise in and of itself is
not sufficient to demonstrate that the merchandise entered the commerce Hong Kong.

With respect to the ``knowledge'' prong of the test, we note that labelling placed on the merchandise in the PRC included
references to U.S. Department of Transportation specifications, Occupational Safety and Health Administration
requirements, and even a U.S. ``800'' telephone number for ``Chemtrec''. Many buyers throughout the world rely on
U.S. standards regardless of origin or destination for a wide variety of products, and reference to a given country's
specifications in labelling does not necessarily imply that the product is destined for sale in that country. Thus,
the labelling in this case is not considered conclusive evidence of knowledge of the product's ultimate destination.
However, the existence of an ``800'' number carries somewhat greater weight and no explanation has been offered for
the inclusion of the number on the label. In fact, both Zunyi and Sinochem have stated in their questionnaire responses
that they were aware at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. After considering
the totality of the evidence on the record with regard to the knowledge prong, including the ordering procedure discussed
above in connection with the ``enter commerce'' prong, we determine that the evidence is consistent with knowledge
by the producers that the merchandise would be sold to the United States, and that the resellers have failed to sustain
their burden of proof with respect to this prong.

Because no reseller has shown that its suppliers were unaware that their merchandise was destined for the United States
or that the shipments of potassium permanganate entered the commerce of Hong Kong, we need not reach other aspects
of the reseller test. Furthermore, since no reseller has shown that it is entitled to a rate other than that of its supplier(s),
we need not reach the question of whether the resellers were selling below the cost of production. Therefore, our preliminary
determination that the rate for all resellers for this review should be that of their suppliers remains unchanged.

Comment 5



Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) state that because they were cooperative respondents in this review, they should not be
``assigned'' the high best information available (BIA) margin from the 1989 review.



DOC Position:

 These resellers have not ``been assigned'' a margin as individual firms. Resellers have no inherent right to a separately
calculated rate, regardless of how cooperative they may be. For the reasons stated above, the circumstances in which
the transactions occurred during this period do not allow the Department to calculate separate rates for these sales.
Thus, we have not assigned individual rates to the resellers, and all sales for this review period will be assessed
a duty based on the margin of the procedures.



Comment 6



Alternatively, Yue-Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) argue that the methodology used to determine the dumping margin in the
1989 review was flawed, and that therefore the margin determined in that review should not be applied as BIA for the
PRC manufacturers in this review. They also claim that in selecting a BIA margin, the Department must consider the
most recent information available, and that any data on which BIA is based is rebuttable. In contesting the use of the
1989 figure, these resellers claim that the use of Thailand as a surrogate and the use of petitioner's own cost data
were inappropriate in the 1989 review, and that costs were improperly calculated in that review.



DOC Position:

 In selecting a BIA margin for the PRC potassium permanganate industry, we followed our usual practice of assigning
an uncooperative respondent the higher of the highest margin determined for any firm in any previous review, or the
original investigation, or the highest rate for a responding company in the current review. See 56 FR 393. The Department's
two-tier BIA methodology was upheld by the Court of Appeals in 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co., et al.

 v. 

United States

, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In this case, we used the highest margin from the immediately preceding review, the
1989 review. The CIT has specifically affirmed, in 

Novachem, Inc.

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 92&hyph;149 (CIT, August 28, 1992), that the Department acted reasonably in utilizing Thai factor data and
petitioner's data in determining that rate. Even if the use of Thailand as a surrogate had not already been upheld by
the CIT, however, the use of a margin from an earlier review does not permit a rearguing of the merits of a rate in a previous
review for which the Department has issued final results of review. The appropriate time for challenging the merits
of the 1989 review has passed. Thus, criticism of our use of the 1989 BIA margin is unfounded.



Comment 7



Zunyi and the importer Novachem state that Zunyi was responsive in this review, and that the Department should therefore
not apply to it the same BIA rate that it applied to non-responsive PRC firms.

The petitioner states that the Department properly applied the highest rate from the 1989 review as BIA for the PRC
firms, noting that this determination was proper due to the presumption of state control in a non-market economy and
the fact that there was no clear showing in this review that any of the PRC manufacturers of subject merchandise are
independent from the state legally, financially, or economically.



DOC Response:

 We agree with the petitioner. For the reasons discussed in response to Comment 2, Zunyi failed to show that it was sufficiently
independent to merit a separate rate for this review. Indeed, the record contains sufficient information to determine
that separate status would be inappropriate. Thus, Zunyi must be considered part of the country-wide potassium permanganate
industry for the purposes of this review. Since the government of the PRC and the industry as a whole did not adequately
respond to our questionnaires (most firms did not respond at all), we have followed our usual practice in assigning,
as BIA for uncooperative respondents, a country-wide margin (see our response to Comment 6). When a country-wide
margin is assigned, the degree of cooperativeness assessed must be that of the industry as a whole. To assign a country-wide
margin based on the response of a single firm could mask dumping by other non-responsive firms within the industry.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to evaluate the extent of Zunyi's cooperation.



Final Results of Review



Upon review of comments submitted, the Department has determined that the margin for all PRC manufacturers/producers/exporters
of potassium permanganate for the period January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1990, is 128.94 percent. The margin
for all third country exporters of potassium permanganate from the PRC for the period January 1, 1990 through December
31, 1990 shall also be 128.94 percent, the rate of their suppliers.

The Customs Service shall assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions concerning all respondents directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of administrative
review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the PRC country-wide firms
will be 128.94 percent, and (2) because no non-PRC exporter has established on the record, for this administrative
review, that it qualifies as an intermediate country reseller under the terms of the statute, the cash deposit rate
for all non-PRC exporters will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.
Specifically, that rate will be the PRC country-wide rate of 128.94 percent we have established in this administrative
review.

Because any PRC firm must affirmatively show that it is entitled to a separate rate before such a rate can be given and
any intermediate country reseller must affirmatively show that it is entitled to such status under the intermediate
country reseller provision of the regulations (19 CFR 353.47), any new shippers will also be subject to the PRC country-wide
deposit rate until they request review and demonstrate an entitlement to an exception. Therefore, there is no need
for an ``all others'' cash deposit rate for intermediate country resellers. Furthermore, no ``all others'' rate
will be established for the PRC. Because a country-wide rate is applied to all imports of potassium permanganate from
the PRC, there is no need for an ``all others'' cash deposit rate for PRC entities.

These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

This notice serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding
the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period.
Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping
duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (``APO'') of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with
the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tarriff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

Establishment of the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Interpreter Test Service, Which Tests an Interpreter's Conformance
to Version 1 CGM as Specified in FIPS 128&hyph;1, Computer Graphics Metafile, and the Continuous Acquisition and
Life-Cycle Support (CALS) Application Profile (AP) (MIL&hyph;D&hyph;28003A)

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of establishment of a CGM Interpreter Test Service for testing an interpreter's conformance to FIPS 128&hyph;1
and the CALS CGM AP.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The NIST CGM Interpreter Test Service utilizes the Interpreter Validation Test (IVaT) Suite, Release 1.0 to assess
whether an interpreter can correctly and completely parse a binary encoded, Version 1 CGM and produce the intended
picture. The IVaT Suite consists of over 200 CGM files, an operator test script, and a set of reference pictures. Specifically,
CGMs are processed by the interpreter and the resulting picture is compared to the expected reference picture. The
focus of the IVaT Suite is on single element testing, rather than multiple elements. This allows for incremental testing
and the specificity needed to determine whether the interpreter under test meets the test criteria.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

The interpreter test service was established April 1, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Written comments concerning the CGM Interpreter Test Service and the IVaT Suite should be sent to: National Institute
of Standards and Technology; ATTN: CGM Test Service, Technology Building, room A266, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 128&hyph;1, Computer Graphics Metafile,
adopts the American National Standards Institute/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/ISO)
Computer Graphics Metafile, ANSI/ISO 8632.1&hyph;4:1992, which defines three versions of the Computer Graphics
Metafile. FIPS 128&hyph;1 adopts all three versions.
Additionally, the FIPS 128&hyph;1 requires the use of application profiles. In particular, the FIPS 128&hyph;1
requires the use of military specification MIL&hyph;D&hyph;28003A, commonly known as the CALS CGM AP, approved
in 1991 for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense. In accordance with FIPS 128&hyph;1, the
development, storage, and interchange of 2D graphical information should be in the digital format of the CGM. As a
data interchange standard, CGM is suitable for the storage and exchange of graphical data (i.e., pictures) among
different computers, graphical devices, and applications.
In addition to the CGM Interpreter Test Service, the NIST also operates a testing service for both CGM metafiles and
generators. The validation processes for metafiles, generators, and interpreters are three distinct processes.
For metafiles, the validation focuses on testing an instance of a CGM; that is, a CGM data stream. For generators, the
validation focuses on testing the CGM generator and its operating environment. All three testing services test for
compliance to Version 1 CGM as specified by FIPS 128&hyph;1.
Federal agencies may require conformance to FIPS 128&hyph;1 if computer graphics metafile systems are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Agencies may require testing to determine
if a CGM metafile, generator, or interpreter conforms to FIPS 128&hyph;1. A Certificate of Validation or Registered
Report provided from the NIST validation test service will be a source for Federal agencies to use in making this determination.
The Certificate and Registered Report will be listed in the ``Validated Products List'', which is issued quarterly
by NIST and is available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), order number PB94&hyph;937301,
telephone (703) 487&hyph;4650.


Obtaining Validation Services


The NIST provides validation test services on a cost-reimbursable basis. These services are available to both the
producers and users of CGM files, generators, and interpreters. Upon request, NIST will supply the client with a CGM
Information Pack which will include a description of the test services and procedures.

State and local Governments. Board membership shall reflect the full diversity of views in the affected community
and region and be composed primarily of people who are directly affected by site clean-up activities. Members may
include, but will not be limited to, interested stakeholders from local governments, Indian Tribes, environmental
and civic groups, labor organizations, universities, waste management and environmental restoration firms, and
other interested parties. Representatives from DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency and state governments
shall be ex-officio members of the board. Selection and appointment of group members shall be accomplished using
procedures designed to ensure a diverse board membership and a balance of viewpoints. Consensus recommendations
to the Department of Energy from the Board on pragmatic nationwide resolution of numerous difficult issues will help
achieve the Department's objective of an integrated environmental restoration program.

Additionally, the establishment of the Site Specific Advisory board has been determined to be compelled by considerations
of health and safety, essential to the conduct of Department of Energy business, and to be in the public interest in
connection with the performance of duties imposed on the Department of Energy by law and agreement. The Board will
operate in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Department of Energy Organization

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background. 
II. Current Actions. 
III. Request for Comments. 


I. Background 


In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91), the Energy Information Administration is obliged
to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program, EIA
collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource reserves,
production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the adequacy
of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social needs. 
The Form EIA&hyph;886 will collect data from Alternate Fuel Vehicle (AFV) suppliers (i.e., Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) and Conversion Companies) according to the requirements of section 503 (b)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(EPACT). The survey will extend to both on-road and off-road, domestically manufactured/converted and imported
vehicles. Actual data are requested for the previous calendar year (e.g., 1994); planned data are solicited for the
next calendar year (e.g., 1995). 


II. Current Actions 


This form is a new, annual data collection effort. This clearance is sought for three years. 


III. Request for Comments 


Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment on the actions discussed in item II. The following
general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. 


As a Potential Respondent: 


A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions require clarification?

B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions? 
C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions?

<PARENT> FR940523-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average 1 hour per response. How much time, including
time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and
completing and reviewing the collection of information, do you estimate it will require you to complete and submit
the required form? 
E. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the
data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to
providing this information. 
F. How can the form be improved? 
G. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency,
the data element(s), and the means of collection. 


As a Potential User: 


A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form? 
B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific. 
C. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs? 
D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths? 
E. For the most part, information is published by EIA in U.S. customary units, e.g., cubic feet of natural gas, short
tons of coal, and barrels of oil. Would you prefer to see EIA publish more information in metric units, e.g., cubic meters,
metric tons, and kilograms? If yes, please specify what information (e.g., coal production, natural gas consumption,
and crude oil imports), the metric unit(s) of measurement preferred, and in which EIA publication(s) you would like
to see such information. 
EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regarding their views on the need for the information contained
in the ``Alternate Fuel Vehicle Suppliers' Annual Report''. 
Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of
the form; they also will become a matter of public record.

<DOCTITLE>Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>
for the Continued Operation of the Pantex Plant 
and Associated Storage of Nuclear Weapon Components 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Department of Energy.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy (the Department) announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement,
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and the Department's implementing procedures (10 CFR part 1021). The purpose
of this Notice is to invite public participation in the process and to encourage public dialogue on alternatives that
should be considered. This Environmental Impact Statement will address the potential environmental impacts concerning
the continued operation of the Pantex Plant, including near- to mid-term foreseeable activities and the nuclear
component storage activities at other Department sites associated with nuclear weapon disassembly at the Pantex
Plant, over the next 5 to 10 years. The Secretary of Energy committed to preparing this Environmental Impact Statement
in a letter to the Governor of Texas and also in the Finding of No Significant Impact (59 FR 3674, January 26, 1994) for
the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at Pantex (DOE/EA&hyph;0812, January
1994). 


The Pantex Plant, near Amarillo, Texas, is the site at which the Department fulfills its responsibilities regarding
the disassembly of nuclear weapons, certain maintenance and monitoring activities of the nuclear weapons stockpile,
modification and assembly of nuclear weapons, and production of high explosive components for nuclear weapons.
The Department also conducts certain quality evaluation of weapons, quality assurance testing of weapon components,
and research and development activities supporting nuclear weapons at the Pantex Plant. The Department's responsibilities
are mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization and appropriation. Currently,
most of the work taking place at the Pantex Plant is the disassembly of nuclear weapons. The nuclear components resulting
from the disassembly of the weapons are either stored at the Pantex Plant; stored or processed at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico; or stored or processed at the Oak Ridge Reservation near Knoxville, Tennessee.
Tritium pressure vessels are processed and the tritium is recycled at the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.

In order to meet the Department's continuing responsibilities regarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, the Department
proposes to continue the current operations of the Pantex Plant, continue the current nuclear component storage
activities at the various Department sites, and implement projects and facility upgrades at Pantex consistent with
current responsibilities over the next 5 to 10 years. Other alternatives being considered for discussion in this
Environmental Impact Statement include the relocation of some of the Pantex Plant operations and relocation of current
storage activities to other Department or Federal sites, as well as the ``No Action'' alternative required by NEPA.
In addition, an alternative discussing the shutdown of operations at the Pantex Plant will be considered in evaluating
baseline conditions. 
This Notice of Intent reflects commitments made to the State of Texas and stakeholders during the public participation
efforts conducted for the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage. The Department will shortly announce other
NEPA analyses that might affect the scope of this Environmental Impact Statement or how commitments will be addressed.
If this occurs, updates on the proposed scope of this Environmental Impact Statement will be published and the public
will be given the opportunity to discuss and comment on any changes during the scoping process.


</SUMMARY>

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



Historically, the Department's national security mission has included the assembly and disassembly of nuclear
weapons as mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization and appropriation. The
Department has carried out this mission at the Pantex Plant, located in the Panhandle of Texas in Carson County near
Amarillo. Assembled weapons are transported and transferred to the Department of Defense for deployment and retired
weapons are returned to the Pantex Plant for disassembly. The Pantex Plant is owned by the Department and currently
operated under contract with the Department by the Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co., Inc. 

Over the years, activities at the Pantex Plant have included four major types of operations: (1) Fabrication of conventional
high explosives, (2) assembly of nuclear weapons from these high explosives and prefabricated weapons components
received from off-site suppliers, (3) maintenance, modification, and quality assurance testing of nuclear weapons
already in the military stockpile, and (4) disassembly of nuclear weapons. The Pantex Plant has conducted these activities
in a safe and responsible fashion for more than 40 years. In the past, the Pantex Plant's primary activity was the assembly
of nuclear weapons. Currently, the Pantex Plant's primary activity is the disassembly of nuclear weapons, although
all of the historical missions are being or may still be performed. 

After the weapons have been disassembled, the disposition of the associated components depends on their characteristics,
the facilities that the Department has available, and any future need for these components. Nuclear components,
those containing significant amounts of tritium or Special Nuclear Material (enriched uranium or plutonium), are
either retained by the Department at the Pantex Plant or sent to facilities at other Department sites. The major nuclear
components and their respective destinations are as follows: 

(a) Plutonium components (pits), which are assemblies containing encapsulated weapons grade plutonium (the major
constituent being the fissile plutonium isotope Pu&hyph;239), are currently retained at the Pantex Plant; 

(b) Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generators, which are components containing an encapsulated plutonium heat
source (the major constituent being the nonfissile isotope Pu&hyph;238), are shipped to the Los Alamos National
Laboratory where the heat source is removed and either stored or de-encapsulated and may be shipped offsite for additional
processing; 

(c) Secondaries, which contain enriched uranium, are sent to the Oak Ridge Reservation for storage; and 

(d) Reservoirs, which are tritium-containing pressure vessels, are sent to the Savannah River Site where the tritium
is purified and reused in the enduring stockpile. 

Non-nuclear components are recycled, salvaged, or disposed of at the Pantex Plant or at other sites. These components
include high explosives, electronics, and structural parts (some of which contain depleted uranium). Some disposition
of these parts is handled through commercial firms. 

The Department recently completed the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at
Pantex. The Department evaluated the proposed interim storage of up to 20,000 pits. In response to comments received
from State and local officials and other stakeholders, the Department decided to store no more than 12,000 pits at
Pantex until a site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (i.e., this Environmental Impact Statement) covering
all current and proposed facilities and activities at Pantex is completed. Additionally, this Environmental Impact
Statement will address the environmental impacts at other sites which may result from the storage of highly enriched
uranium, tritium, and weapons components resulting from the dismantlement of nuclear weapons. A Record of Decision
for this Environmental Impact Statement will be issued by November 15, 1996. The Department is preparing to initiate
separate NEPA documentation that will address the long-term disposition of the materials and components covered
in this Environmental Impact Statement, as well as other materials. 



Preliminary Identification of Alternatives and Issues 



A preliminary set of alternatives and issues for evaluation in the Environmental Impact Statement has been identified
below. The final set of alternatives and issues to be considered in the Environmental Impact Statement will reflect
consideration of the public input received during the scoping period. 



Proposed Action 



The proposed action is to meet the Department's responsibilities over the next 5 to 10 years by continuing to operate
the Pantex Plant with its current missions, and by continuing to store nuclear components at the Department sites
currently used for that purpose. Continuing operations include production of high explosives, weapon components,
assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons, modification and maintenance of the nuclear weapon stockpile, quality
assurance testing of weapon components, evaluation and surveillance of nuclear weapons, and research and development
activities supporting nuclear weapons. In addition, the proposed action also involves implementing those facility
upgrades, modifications, replacement facilities, and new proposed projects that are foreseeable over the next
5 to 10 years, pursuant to the missions at Pantex as established by Congress and the President. This alternative would
involve storing, on an interim basis, up to 20,000 pits at the Pantex Plant. The proposed action at the Pantex Plant
would include the establishment of a new research center, the potential for new mixed-waste treatment facilities,
environmental cleanup and restoration activities, cooperative agreements with Texas Technical University, and
activities associated with the technology transfer program. The proposed action would also include all routine
activities such as infrastructure and building maintenance, operations and equipment relocations and consolidations,
modifications to buildings, general landscaping, site characterization, transportation of materials, and similar
support activities. 

The proposed action will also consider and analyze to the extent practicable any environmental issues or impacts
that may arise from the implementation of decisions by Congress and the President to allow third-party inspection
at the Pantex Plant as part of any implementation of national nonproliferation policy. 



Other Alternatives 



The following is an initial list of other alternatives for analysis in this Environmental Impact Statement. The list
is tentative and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it imply any predetermined selection of any alternative
or decisions. Changes to this list may occur as the result of public input and the scoping process. 

Alternatives to the proposed action that have been preliminarily identified include:

<TEXT>
 

1. One alternative upon which the Department requests the public's views would consist of continuing the current
course of operations at the Pantex Plant and the current component storage and recycling activities at the various
Department sites. This is commonly referred to as a ``no action'' alternative. This alternative would not include
any new projects or general facility upgrades or modifications. Current Pantex operations would include those projects
already authorized and funded through Fiscal Year 1995, transportation activities (both onsite and offsite), environmental
cleanup and restoration activities, and routine maintenance. The interim storage of up to 12,000 pits at the Pantex
Plant would continue. The storage of highly enriched uranium components at the Oak Ridge Reservation, and the recycling
of tritium-containing components at the Savannah River Site and Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generators at Los
Alamos would also continue. No Action would result in curtailing dismantlement or the relocation of pits above 12,000
to another site for interim storage. 
2. A second alternative upon which the Department requests the public's views would discuss those activities that
could be relocated or performed somewhere other than at the Pantex Plant and the current storage locations. This alternative
will discuss the transfer of some or all of pit storage activities from the Pantex Plant and relocation of the other
nuclear component storage from other sites. Discussion of alternate locations for some Pantex Plant operations
will include the Nevada Test Site. Discussion of alternate locations for nuclear component storage will include
certain Department sites and other Federal facilities, including those currently owned and operated by the Department
of Defense. This alternative will analyze and consider, to the extent practical, any environmental issues or impacts
that may arise from the implementation of decisions by Congress and the President to allow third-party inspection
at the Pantex Plant as part of any implementation of national nonproliferation policy. 


Department of Defense Sites as Storage Alternatives 


The Department of Energy solicits comments on the inclusion of Department of Defense sites as possible alternatives
for the storage of nuclear components resulting from weapons disassembly. Through the public comment process on
the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage, a number of questions were raised in regard to the possibility
of using Department of Defense sites as interim storage locations. Since the fact that nuclear weapons exist at a specific
Department of Defense site is classified by the Department of Defense, the Environmental Assessment analyzed three
generic sites: an active nuclear weapons storage facility, an inactive nuclear weapons storage facility, and an
active conventional weapons storage facility. The use of Department of Defense sites was not considered as a viable
alternative to the interim storage of plutonium components at the Pantex Plant under the Environmental Assessment
for Interim Storage because it was not timely (per the immediate need), would cost more, and offered no environmental
benefit. 

The Department of Energy is again considering Department of Defense sites as alternatives for near to mid-term storage
of nuclear components at Department of Energy sites. Preliminary meetings have been held with Department of Defense
staff to discuss the process for identifying facilities that are now or will be in excess to the Department of Defense
needs that could be made available to the Department of Energy or those facilities where a joint tenant agreement could
permit the Department to occupy a part of a larger facility. Based on the result of a facility review and preliminary
assessment process, the degree of additional analysis, which may include additional scoping meetings at specific
locations, and consideration of the Department of Defense facility alternatives will be determined. However, due
to the same concerns regarding the classification of information about specific Department of Defense sites, the
Department may be required to use the generic site method described above to discuss Department of Defense alternatives.
The Department solicits comments on how to conduct the analysis of alternative Department of Defense storage sites
so that maximum public participation is possible. 


Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues 


The issues listed below have been tentatively identified for analysis in this Environmental Impact Statement as
being applicable to the operation of the Pantex Plant and the storage of nuclear components. The list is tentative
and should be considered as illustrative to facilitate public comment on the scope of this Environmental Impact Statement.
It is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it imply any predetermination of potential impacts. The Department
invites suggestions for the addition or deletion of items on this list. Identified issues include:



_Potential effects on the public and workers from releases of radiological and hazardous materials during normal
operations and from reasonably postulated accidents, including aircraft crashes; 
_Potential effects of natural disasters including floods, tornadoes, and seismic events; 
_Potential effect on air and water quality and other environmental consequences of normal operations and potential
accidents; 
_Potential cumulative effects of operations at the Pantex Plant and the storage activities at other sites, including
relevant impacts from transportation activities, environmental restoration, present operations, and reasonably
foreseeable activities at the sites; 
_Potential socioeconomic impacts on surrounding communities, including demographics, economic base, labor pool,
housing, transportation, utilities, public services/facilities, and education; 
_Potential impacts on environmental justice; 
_Potential effects on endangered species, economically and recreationally important species, floodplains, wetlands,
and historic and archaeological resources, including paleontological sites and Native American resources;

_Potential effects on future decontamination and decommissioning decisions; 
_Potential impacts from energy requirements and conservation alternatives; 
_Effects on near and long-term waste management practices and activities, including pollution prevention, waste
minimization, and waste stream characterization; 
_Potential effects on agricultural lands and practices; 
_Potential impacts of noise levels to the ambient environment and sensitive receptors; 
_Potential impacts to scenic and visual resources; 
_Potential impacts on land use plans, policies, and controls; 
_Unavoidable adverse environmental impacts; 
_Short-term uses of the environment versus long-term productivity; and 
_Potential irretrievable and irreversible commitment of resources. 


Related Documentation 


Background information regarding the operation of the Pantex Plant is available in the public reading rooms listed
above. The Department will prepare transcripts of the oral comments received during the scoping meetings. The records
of all comments, both oral and written, received during the scoping period will be made available for public review
in the reading rooms listed earlier. All additional background documents and references developed during the Environmental
Impact Statement process will also be made available in the reading rooms. 
The following is a list of forthcoming NEPA documentation related to this Environmental Impact Statement that have
the potential for affecting its scope: 
(a) Reconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement_On July 23, 1993, the Department published a
revised Notice of Intent to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for reconfiguration of its nuclear
weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department will soon issue an update to its revised
Notice of Intent which will reflect recent budget and stockpile reduction decisions; 
(b) Fissile Materials Storage and Disposition Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement_A draft Notice of Intent
has been provided to stakeholders for review and comment. In the near future, the Department plans to publish a Notice
of Intent in the 

Federal Register

 for a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement to address long-term storage of all fissile nuclear materials
and disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials; and 
(c) Proposed Interim Storage of Highly Enriched Uranium above the Maximum Historical Storage Level at the Y&hyph;12
Plant, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This Environmental Assessment addresses proposed storage of highly enriched uranium
above the maximum historical storage level at the Y&hyph;12 Plant. The draft Environmental Assessment has been reviewed
by the State and by stakeholders, and is being revised. 


Public Meeting Registration and Format 


Oral and written comments may be presented at the public scoping meetings. Persons desiring to speak at any of these
meetings should register by calling the Pantex Plant Environmental Impact Statement Hotline by 3 p.m. two working
days in advance of the scoping meeting; writing to Mr. Rosson at the Albuquerque Operations Office address; or submitting
written requests using the Pantex Plant Environmental Impact Statement Faxline. Persons wishing to speak that have
not registered in advance may register at the entrance of the meeting room. Individuals speaking on behalf of an organization
should identify the organization represented. 
In order to solicit individual viewpoints and facilitate interactive communication between participants and representatives
of the Department, separate meeting rooms will be established concurrent with the formal scoping meetings for questions
and informal discussions regarding the issues in this Environmental Impact Statement. 


Subsequent Document Preparation 


After the completion of the public scoping process, the Department will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
Implementation Plan (the Plan) and make it available to the public upon request and place it in the public reading rooms.
The Plan will record the results of the scoping process and define the alternatives and issues that the Department
will evaluate in this Environmental Impact Statement. The Department intends to complete the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement in November 1995 and will announce its availability in the 

Federal Register

. The Department will solicit comments from the public, organizations, and other agencies on the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement, and will consider all comments in its preparation of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.

<DOCTITLE>Northern Natural Gas Co.; Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed EF Expansion Project and
Request for Comments on Environmental Issues</DOCTITLE>



May 17, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of natural gas pipeline facilities
proposed in the EF Expansion Project.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
Northern Natural Gas Company's (Northern) application was filed with the Commission under section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act.
</FOOTNOTE>


Summary of the Proposed Project



The applicant proposes to construct and operate the following facilities:

A. Three segments of approximately 11.95 miles of pipeline:

&bull;1.28 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline in Washington County, Minnesota (C-Line Extension);

&bull;2.82 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline in Steele County, Minnesota (D-Line Extension);

&bull;7.85 miles of 8-inch-diameter pipeline in Morrison County, Minnesota (Alexandria Branchline Loop); and

B. modify nine existing Town Border Stations (TBS) (see appendix 1).

The proposed facilities would be used to transport up to 19,288 Mcfd to Minnegasco, a Division of Arkla, Inc. and Great
Plains Natural Gas Company.

The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 2.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
Appendices 2 and 3 are not being printed in the 

Federal Register

. Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington,
DC 20426, or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the
mail.

</FOOTNOTE>


Land Requirements for Construction



The proposed pipeline would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. Northern intends to use a 75-foot-wide
construction right-of-way. About 25 to 35 feet of the planned 75-foot width would use existing right-of-way. Consequently,
about 35 to 50 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction, about 25 feet of the construction
right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use.

Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream
crossings.



The EA Process



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:



&bull;geology and soils

&bull;water resources, fisheries, and wetlands

&bull;vegetation and wildlife

&bull;endangered and threatened species

&bull;land use

&bull;cultural resources

&bull;hazardous waste




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-2-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-2-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed 
project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on 
how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. 
Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, 
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, State, and local 
agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, 
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's 
official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will 
be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider 
all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission 
approve or not approve the project. 



Currently Identified Environmental Issues 



We have already identified several issues that we think 
deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed 
facilities and the environmental information provided by 
Northern. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The 
list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed 
based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are: 

&bull;The Alexandria Branchline Loop crosses residential 
land within the Platte River Estate. 

&bull;The pipeline would cross 4 perennial streams 
and 19 wetlands. 
&bull;The project may potentially impact federally listed 
threatened or endangered species. 
&bull;The project may cross or be near cultural 
resources/archeological sites. 



Public Participation 


You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing 
your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should 
focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, 
alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and 
measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more 
specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please 
follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are 
received and properly recorded: 

&bull;Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., NE, Washington, DC 20426; 

&bull;Reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;224&hyph;000; 
&bull;Send a copy of your letter to: 
Ms. Medha Kochhar, EA Project Manager, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., room 7312, 
Washington, DC 20426; and 
&bull;Mail your comments so that they will be received in 
Washington, DC on or before June 10, 1994. 
If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one 
from Ms. Medha Kochhar at the above address. 


Becoming an Intervenor 


In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you 
may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become 
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right 
to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and 
filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must 
provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want 
to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene 
according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 3. 
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this 
proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file 
late interventions must show good cause, as required by &sect;385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. 
Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late 
intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your 
scoping comments considered. 
Additional information about the proposed project is 
available from Ms. Medha Kochhar, EA Project Manager, at (202) 
208&hyph;2270.

<DOCTITLE>Wisconsin Power &amp; Light Comp.; Availability Of Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



May 17, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a subsequent license for the existing Beloit Blackhawk Hydroelectric Project, located on the
Rock River in Rock County, Wisconsin, in the city of Beloit, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for
the project.

On March 10, 1994, staff issued and distributed to all parties a draft EA, and requested that comments on the draft EA
be filed with the Commission within 30 days. One comment letter was received for the draft EA and is addressed in the
final EA.

In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project
and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures,
would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Arkansas Gas Consumers v. Arkla Energy Resources Co.; Complaint</DOCTITLE>


May 17, 1994.


Take notice that on May 9, 1994, Arkansas Gas Consumers (AGC), filed a complaint against Arkla Energy Resources (AERCo).
AGC states that this complaint pertains to the unjust and unreasonable gas accounting practices and imbalance resolution
procedures which AERCo has enforced on its system since the implementation of restructuring on September 1, 1993.
AGC states that the practices and procedures are premised on the mistaken belief that a business transaction occurs
between a pipeline and its customer whenever the customer's projection of its daily gas use is later shown to have differed
from its actual gas use for that day.
AGC requests the Commission to find (1) That AERCo's existing imbalance resolution methodology is unjust, unreasonable
and void 

ab initio 

as applied to customers who receive their gas from paper pools rather than actual physical supply sources; and (2)
that AERCo's methodology should be replaced with a new procedure consistent with the principles.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214
and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should
be filed on or before June 16, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action
to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must
file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before June 16, 1994.

ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the 

Federal Register

 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 11 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals; Approval of a Test Marketing Exemption</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME&hyph;94&hyph;10.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATES: 

 May 13, 1994. Written comments will be received until June 7, 1994.



</DATE>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Robert Wright, III, New Chemicals Branch, Chemical Control Division (7405), Office of Pollution Prevention and
Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;611, 401 M St. SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7800.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME&hyph;94&hyph;10. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met.
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA nonconfidential information
center (NCIC), Rm. NEB&hyph;607 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
The following additional restrictions apply to TME&hyph;94&hyph;10. A bill of lading accompanying each shipment
must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition, the applicant shall
maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them available for inspection
or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
1.&blank; Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.
2.&blank; Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
3.&blank; Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.




TME&hyph;94&hyph;10




Date of Receipt:

 March 28, 1994. The extended comment period will close June 7, 1994.


Applicant:

 Reichhold Chemical. 


Chemical:

 (G) Polyurethane adhesive.


Use:

 (G) Adhesive.


Production Volume:

 Confidential.


Number of Customers:

 Confidential.


Test Marketing Period:

 Confidential. Commencing on first day of commercial manufacture.


Risk Assessment:

 EPA identified health concerns for lung toxicity and lung cancer if inhaled, sensitization, irritation, and irritation
to membranes, based on data on substances structurally similar to the TME substance. However, health concerns were
mitigated because there is expected to be negligible inhalation exposure of the TME substance to workers, and adequate
worker protection and hazard communication to address sensitization and irritation concerns. EPA identified no
significant environmental concerns for the test market substance. Therefore, the test market activities will not
present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.
The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information that comes to its attention cast significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


In a letter dated August 12, 1991, Calgene, Inc., requested an advisory opinion under &sect;10.85 (21 CFR 10.85) concerning
whether FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes are food and, therefore, subject to the same regulation as other tomato varieties. In developing the FLAVR
SAVR

TM

 tomato, Calgene used recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques to introduce an antisense polygalacturonase
(PG) gene. The sense PG gene, normally present in tomatoes, encodes the enzyme PG, which is associated with the breakdown
of pectin (a constituent of the cell wall in tomato fruit). The principle underlying the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato is that the antisense PG gene suppresses the production of the PG enzyme, resulting in ripe fruit that remains
firm for an extended period, which allows fresh market tomatoes to be vine-ripened for enhanced flavor. 



In the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984), FDA issued a policy statement (the 1992 policy statement) that clarifies the agency's
interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties.
On that same date, FDA announced Calgene's advisory opinion request (57 FR 22772), and requested public comment.
FDA believed that such a notice was in the public interest because that request was the first made to FDA regarding the
status of a whole food produced by the new methods of gene transfer. 
In light of the publication of the 1992 policy statement, FDA now believes that the status of a particular product,
such as the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato, should be addressed through a consultation with the agency consistent with the principles outlined in that
statement. As a result of that consultation, FDA has notified Calgene, in a letter dated May 17, 1994, that the agency
has concluded that FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes have not been significantly altered when compared to varieties of tomatoes with a history of safe use (21
CFR 170.30(f)(2)). FDA has prepared a written summary of the agency's consultation with Calgene. The written summary
includes a response to the comments received on the Calgene advisory opinion request, including comments contained
in a citizen petition (Docket No. 92P&hyph;0222/CP1) filed in accordance with &sect;10.30 (21 CFR 10.30).
FDA believes that this notice brings to closure the public process that began with the agency's announcement of Calgene's
advisory opinion request. 
FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes contain the kanamycin resistance gene (the 

kan



r

 gene) that encodes the enzyme aminoglycoside-3
&rsquo;-phosphotransferase II (APH(3
&rsquo;)II). In the 

Federal Register

 of July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38429), FDA announced that Calgene had filed a food additive petition (FAP 3A4364) proposing
that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. Elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is publishing a final rule that amends the agency's food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. The agency
evaluated the safety of APH(3
&rsquo;)II in the context of FAP 3A4364 and not as part of the consultation with Calgene that is the subject of this notice.

Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by 
participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed notice. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the Medicare program's proposal not to cover electrostimulation of the salivary glands for
the treatment of xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome, and electrostimulation devices, such as the Salitron
System. Public Health Service (PHS) studies show that there are insufficient data to establish the clinical utility
of electrostimulation, to evaluate its long-term effectiveness, and to identify those xerostomia patients who
would benefit from this procedure. Also, PHS reports that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as a treatment
for xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Therefore, it does not meet HCFA's criteria for effectiveness.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background 



A. Program Description 



Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) generally prohibits payment for any expenses incurred
for items or services ``which,
 * * * are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning
of a malformed body member.'' We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coverage medical
and health care services and items that are not demonstrated to be safe and effective by acceptable clinical evidence.
This prohibition applies to items for which claims are submitted under Medicare's durable medical equipment (DME)
benefit. 



B. Medicare Coverage of Electrostimulation of Salivary Glands for the Treatment of Xerostomia (Dry Mouth) Secondary
to Sjogren's Syndrome 



Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness, have difficulty eating dry foods,
and are susceptible to increased tooth decay, oral pain, tongue fissures, and infection. Saliva contains proteins
and enzymes that aid digestion, conduct electrolytes necessary to maintain hard tooth enamel, and produce antibacterial
agents to control oral bacteria. Salivary gland dysfunction leads to difficulty in speaking, chewing, swallowing,
and tasting. A decrease in salivary secretion may result from damage to the salivary glands caused by chronic infection,
irradiation, or systemic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or Sjogren's syndrome. Sjogren's syndrome is
a chronic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease in which the salivary and tear glands undergo progressive destruction
by lymphocytes and plasma cells resulting in decreased production of saliva and tears.

Treatment for xerostomia varies considerably. If Vitamin C tablets, gum, and hard candy do not stimulate salivation
in patients with some salivary gland function, artificial saliva using either an atomizer or an intraoral reservoir
are used. While these methods relieve the symptoms of chronic xerostomia, they usually offer only temporary relief.
Oral drugs such as pilocarpine and pyridostigmine are effective in increasing salivation if there are some functioning
salivary gland tissues. However, because of side effects and contraindications, the usefulness of these drugs is
limited. 

On March 27, 1987, Biosonics, Inc. requested marketing approval by the FDA of the Salitron System. This device is a
battery-powered, hand-held electrostimulation device for stimulating salivation from existing glandular tissue
by delivering a small electrical stimulus to the mouth using a probe with two metal electrodes. It is used for patients
with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions.
Physicians use the device to screen patients to determine a response to electrostimulation before prescribing the
system. After reviewing the recommendation of the Dental Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, the FDA granted premarket approval for the Salitron System on May 18, 1988. The approval was announced in the
July 14, 1988, notice entitled ``Biosonics; Premarket Approval of the Salitron System'' (53 FR 26673). At this time,
the Salitron System is the only device approved for marketing by the FDA for electrostimulation of salivary glands.


Currently, Medicare does not have a national policy for covering electrostimulation of salivary production for
treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Without a national policy, Medicare carriers have authority
under section 1842(a) of the Act to make coverage decisions within the parameters set by the statute, regulations,
and program instructions. Some carriers are paying for electrostimulation of the salivary glands using the Salitron
System and others are not because they question the medical efficacy of the treatment. This has resulted in inconsistent
coverage policies among carriers. 



C. Recommendation Not to Cover Electrostimulation of Salivary Production in the Treatment of Xerostomia Secondary
to Sjogren's Syndrome 



On May 26, 1988, Biosonics requested that Medicare issue a national policy decision that would provide for coverage
of the Salitron System. Based on our evaluation of their request, we consulted the HCFA Physicians Panel. The Panel
recommended that OHTA evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Salitron System as well as the criteria used to
identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from the device. 

On October 4, 1988, we asked OHTA to conduct a full assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the Salitron System
and to develop patient selection criteria. To conduct this assessment, OHTA solicited information from clinicians,
appropriate private organizations, researchers, other government agencies, other components of PHS, and the National
Institutes of Health (NIH). OHTA evaluated studies, data provided to the FDA, published articles, and information
from respondents to the March 2, 1989, notice entitled ``National Center for Health Services Research and Health
Care Technology Assessment; Assessment of Medical Technology'' (54 FR 8829). In that notice, OHTA announced that
it was assessing the patient criteria for electrostimulation of salivary glands for the treatment of xerostomia
secondary to Sjogren's syndrome and an electrostimulation device's acceptability, cost, and effectiveness relative
to other therapies. 

On July 30, 1990, we received OHTA's assessment ``Salivary Electrostimulation in Sjogren's Syndrome'' with a bibliography
of literature and investigations evaluating electrostimulation of salivary glands. (A copy of this assessment
is included as an addendum to this proposed notice.) 

According to OHTA, from the limited studies as well as data provided to the FDA, it appears that electrostimulation
of salivary glands may be useful in managing xerostomia in certain patients. OHTA, however, states that there are
insufficient data to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate its long-term clinical
effectiveness, and to identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from this procedure. Also, OHTA has determined
that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective method for treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's
syndrome and that other treatments, such as the use of Vitamin C tablets, gum, hard candy, and artificial saliva, are
available.

NIH advised OHTA that guidelines specifying the types and conditions of xerostomia patients who would benefit from
electrostimulation cannot be developed without further clinical studies of well-characterized patient populations.
Given the single published study showing that only patients with residual salivary flow in an unstimulated state
will respond to electrostimulation, NIH suspects that those individuals are likely to respond as well to other means
of salivary stimulation. 

OHTA reviewed the published study, the preliminary investigation, and the study presented to the FDA. The 1988 study
by M. Steller and associates (``Electrostimulation of Salivary Flow in Patients with Sjogren's Syndrome'' Journal
of Dental Research 1988; 67(60): 1334 through 1337) revealed that only 3 of 13 patients using an active device showed
a significant response in salivary production when compared to the response of the placebo device group. The 1986
preliminary investigation conducted by W. W. Weiss and associates (``Clinical Trial of an Electronic Stimulatory
Device in the Management of Xerostomia'' Journal of Oral and Maxillo-facial Surgery November 1986: M10) did not include
a control group or any quantitative assessment of salivary response, duration of response, or long-term assessment
of efficacy. Moreover, 7 of the 9 patients tested had residual saliva production before treatment and may have been
exhibiting a tactile response to the probe. The 1988 study by N. Talal and associates (``The Clinical Effects of Electrostimulation
on Salivary Function of Sjogren's Syndrome Patients'' Rheumatology International June 1992; 12(12) 43 through
45), upon which the FDA based its approval, describes the clinical effects of electrostimulation in 77 patients.
Salivary production was measured at the start of the study, at 2 weeks, and at 4 weeks. The researchers reported that
salivation was higher among the group using an active device than the placebo device group. However, because of a misunderstanding
about the length of the study, about half of the subjects dropped out of the study by the fourth week. 

Thus, OHTA concluded that additional, long-term studies with larger patient populations are needed to define the
specific degrees of salivary dysfunction that would respond to electrostimulation and to determine how long it takes
to determine if salivary glands have been regenerated. These studies could help determine whether a single salivary
response to electrostimulation or some other test, such as a lip biopsy, should be used to help identify those patients
who may benefit from electrostimulation. In addition, OHTA stated that to determine the effectiveness of electrostimulation,
studies should include information regarding concomitant therapy and the duration of the salivary response to compare
the device to other therapies. Studies and subsequent management should include quantitative assessment of salivary
function, assessment of oral conditions, and subjective patient evaluations. 

The comments OHTA received from knowledgeable clinicians were inconsistent. Some clinicians state that electrostimulation
is safe and effective while others suggest that the method has been inadequately tested and are not convinced that
it is more effective than other simple, less costly stimulation techniques. 

After OHTA's published report, Biosonics requested review of additional data on the use of the Salitron System. On
September 21, 1990, we submitted the data to OHTA. OHTA reported on October 26, 1990, that this data had been presented
to the FDA and was included in the OHTA assessment of July 30, 1990. OHTA concluded that the treatment could be reassessed
when additional data from a larger patient population is available to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness
of electrostimulation and identify those xerostomia patients who would benefit from an electrostimulation device.


On November 2, 1990, we submitted to OHTA another request for a review of data from Biosonics. On November 14, 1990,
OHTA informed us that it had previously reviewed this data and referred us to its October 26, 1990, recommendation.


On October 9, 1992, Biosonics requested a reassessment and submitted two new articles on electrostimulation for
xerostomia published in ``Geriatric Consultant'' and ``Rheumatology International.'' One article reported a
physician's experience in treating 33 patients for 6 months. The other article reported on the unpublished clinical
study evaluated by the FDA in 1988. We have determined that the medical evidence and conclusions upon which OHTA's
assessment is based are still accurate based on our own medical expertise and a thorough review of all the medical literature
on the subject since the 1990 assessment.

II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice 



OHTA concluded that there are insufficient data to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate
its long-term clinical effectiveness, and to identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from this procedure
and that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective treatment for xerostomia. Based on these conclusions,
we have determined that electrostimulation of salivary glands and the electrostimulation device, the Salitron
System, do not meet our criteria for effectiveness. Therefore, we propose to publish a final notice announcing a national
coverage decision that Medicare does not cover electrostimulation of salivary glands for treating xerostomia secondary
to Sjogren's syndrome. 

The provisions of this notice would not affect any existing Medicare regulations. However, they would be incorporated
in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6). 



III. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on proposed notices, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the


DATES

 section of this preamble, and if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document. 



IV. Collection of Information Requirements



This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

). 



V. Regulatory Impact Statement 



A. Introduction 



Currently, Medicare does not have a national policy for covering electrostimulation of salivary production for
treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Medicare carriers have authority to make coverage decisions
within the parameters set by the statute, regulations, and program instructions. Because this service is not ordered
often and because of the low total allowed charges by Medicare Part B for this service, less than $26,000 in calendar
year (CY) 1991, and no reported payments in CY 1992, we believe this proposed notice would result in negligible savings
during calendar years 1994 through 1998. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians prescribing and suppliers distributing
a device to stimulate salivary production from existing glandular tissue are considered to be small entities. 

In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 

The Medicare program paid for 41 electrostimulation devices during CY 1991 totaling an estimated $26,000 at an average
cost of approximately $630 each. It appears that carriers are no longer paying for this electrostimulation device,
thereby explaining why no invoices for this device were processed in CY 1992. In the absence of this notice, it is possible
that the number of devices prescribed by physicians would increase and carriers would resume payment. Physicians
have at least two alternate methods for treating xerostomia. One method is to rely on the use of artificial saliva in
conjunction with the sipping of liquids for moisture. The second alternative is the use of gums and candies to induce
saliva. Since there are alternative treatment methods, we believe this proposed notice would affect physicians
and beneficiaries minimally.

Patient Selection Criteria for Electrostimulation of Salivary Production in the Treatment of Xerostomia Secondary
to Sjogren's Syndrome



Prepared by: Martin Erlichman



Introduction



Electrostimulation has been introduced as a technique for increasing salivary output in the treatment of patients
with xerostomia (dry mouth) secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. The procedure uses an electrostimulation device (salivation
electrostimulator) to increase salivary production from existing glandular tissue. The device delivers a small
electrical stimulus to the mouth via a probe. The electrostimulation device consists of an electric control module,
a connecting cord, and a hand-held stimulus probe with two metal electrodes. The device may be battery-powered. Patients
with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions who demonstrate a decrease in the flow rate of saliva
are potential candidates for this procedure.

Xerostomia may be the result of Sjogren's syndrome, other diseases, medications, or radiation therapy to the head
and neck. To determine that the xerostomia has resulted from Sjogren's syndrome, clinicians also confirm the presence
of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) and a positive lip biopsy with or without the presence of a connective tissue
disease. It is estimated that more than one million people, mostly women, suffer from Sjogren's syndrome in the United
States.

1



Xerostomia is usually defined as a symptom that exists when saliva production is less than 0.1 mL/min (or 0.1 g/min).
However, the symptom of xerostomia has been reported to appear when normal salivary output declines by approximately
50%, regardless of the starting value. Normal saliva production has been estimated to be 600 mL/24h.

2

 Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness and find it difficult to eat dry foods.

3

 In addition to the subjective complaints, the patient with salivary gland dysfunction is susceptible to increased
dental caries, oral pain, frequent infections, and difficulties in speaking, chewing, and swallowing.

4

 Several tests are available for measuring salivary function. According to Fox et al,

5

 evaluation of salivary gland function can be assessed by stimulated saliva collection and analysis. The biopsy of
the salivary glands, usually obtained from the lower lip, is used to differentiate true Sjogren's syndrome from other
forms of salivary gland dysfunction.

The approach to the treatment of this condition varies considerably. In some patients, xerostomia may be managed
by sipping water frequently. Other patients stimulate salivary flow with sugarless mints or gum.

6

 Salivary substitutes such as a carboxymethylcellulose-based artificial saliva have been used by some patients
to supplement low quantities of salivary flow. Pharmacologic agents have been introduced to treat the oral dryness
of salivary gland dysfunction in patients where unstimulated salivary flow was low or nonexistent but where some
functional salivary gland tissue existed. Fox et al

4

 reported that pilocarpine was effective for relieving xerostomia by increasing natural salivary function. The
production of endogenous saliva is of greatest benefit to the patient both for its convenience and the importance
of natural saliva to oral functions. Recently, attempts to increase saliva production have utilized electrical
stimulation. Preliminary investigations were reported by Weiss et al

7

 in 1986. 

This report will examine the published literature and other available evidence to evaluate the electrostimulation
of salivary production and determine if there are xerostomic patients who would benefit from this procedure.



Background



Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease in which the salivary and lacrimal glands undergo
progressive destruction by lymphocytes and plasma cells resulting in decreased production of tears and saliva.

8

 Sjogren's syndrome is seen predominantly in middle-aged elderly women.

9

 Females are involved 10 times more commonly than males. Secondary effects of xerostomia include impairment in the
normal movement of lips and tongue, thereby hampering speech, mastication, and swallowing.

10

 Additional signs include oral soreness, adherence of food to buccal surfaces, fissuring of the tongue, an altered
sense of taste, and a marked increase in dental caries and infection. Soreness and redness of the mucosa are usually
the result of candidal infection, which is found in approximately 70% of the Sjogren's syndrome patients.

11



Complaints resulting from dryness of the mouth are varied and often describe the difficulties encountered in trying
to eat dry foods without sufficient lubrication.

11

 Many subjects require frequent ingestion of liquids. They may resort to carrying water bottles or hard candy.

The parotid gland enlarges in many patients secondary to cellular infiltration and ductal obstruction. Usually
asymptomatic and self-limited, the enlargement can be recurrent and associated with pain or erythema. Focal infiltrates
of lymphocytes are also found in the minor salivary glands of the lower lip. Biopsy provides histologic confirmation
and quantification of the degree of infiltration.

The subjective imprsssion of xerostomia, or oral dryness, may not reflect actual salivary gland capabilities.12
Salivary flow rate estimation is a sensitive indicator of salivary gland function. A suction cup is used to obtain
parotid saliva from the gland after the tongue is stimulated with citric acid. Although the parotid glands make the
major contribution to the total salivary flow, the submandibular glands are the most consistently affected glands
in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Measurement of parotid function may result in false-normal valuse. In Sjogren's
syndrome, measurement of the submandibular/sublingual secretions are a sensitive indicator of salivary gland
hypofunction. According to Fox et al12 alterations in submandibular/sublingual function have the greatest impact
on the sensation of oral dryness.

Another useful technique for studying the salivary glands is lip biopsy. The technique is a sensitive and specific
diagnostic procedure for Sjogren's syndrome. It is well tolerated and causes no disfigurement. The changes in the
minor glands of the lower lip show a close correlation with those in the major salivary glands.11 In addition to confirming
the diagnosis, biopsy allows quantification of the degree of lymphocytic infiltration and tissue damage. Aggregates
of lymphocytes within the acinar tissue are scored. An aggregate of 50 or more cells represents a focus. The number
of foci within 4mm2 of glandular tissue is determined and constitutes the focus score. A focus score of more than 1 is
characteristic of Sjogren's syndrome.8

Salivary scintigraphy, which measures the uptake, concentration, and excretion of technetium pertechnetate by
the major salivary glands, is also a sensitive index of glandular function. However, it is expensive, requires exposure
to a radionuclide, and has little advantage over the other two procedures.8

The symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth in the absence of any drug treatment or other disorder likely to be causal suggest
a diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome.11 According to Talal8 the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome is based upon the confirmed
presence of two of the following three criteria: (1) a focus score of more than 1 in the labial salivary gland biopsy,
(2) dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and (3) an associated connective tissue or lymphoproliferative disorder.
The triad of dry eyes, dry mouth, and a connective tissue or collagen disease, usually rheumatoid arthritis, is termed
secondary Sjogren's syndrome.11 Dry eyes and dry mouth in the absence of a collagen disease is referred to as primary
Sjogren's syndrome. The use of diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs, antihistamines, antipsychotic, and antidepressants
may diminish lacrimal and salivary gland function.13 Because the use of anticholinergic drugs as well as a number
of other medications may be the single most frequent cause of xerostomia, it is essential to estsblish the presence
of focal lymphoid infiltrates and autoimmunity in a patient suspected of having Sjogren's syndrome. Supportive
serologic data would include the presence of antinuclear antibodies, an elevated erythrocyte sedimenation rate,
and the presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies.

Treatment of xerostomia is difficult and includes preventing caries, treating and retreating oral candidiasis,
and attempting to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth by increasing fluid intake, replacing absent saliva with saliva
substitutes, or stimulating the remaining glandular tissue to secrete. Patients presenting with milder stages
of xerostomia may benefit from frequent small sips of water or other fluids such as fruit nectars, and this may be as
effective as any other means of alleviating symptoms. Sialagogues such as vitamin C tablets, sugarless chewing gum,
mints, or hard candies may offer temporary relief through masticatory or gustatory stimulation. For other patients,
saliva substitutes may ameliorate symptoms and possibly increase salivary flow. Efforts at relieving the symptoms
of chronic xerostomia through the use of salivary substitutes and by stimulating salivary flow usually offer only
temporary relief from dryness. Nevertheless, appropriate management of patients with xerostomia requires that
those patients whose salivary flow can be increased by means of sialagogues be distinguished from those patients
whose salivary flow cannot be stimulated, or whose flow is insufficiently stimulated.14 Patient response can be
tested with the use of a mechanical (paraffin chewing) or a gustatory (citric acid) stimulant.15 The placement of
citric acid crystals or a 2% citric acid solution in the mouth will stimulate demonstrable salivary flow within a few
minutes in responsive patients.12

Where stimulation of salivary flow by sialagogues has been ineffective, saliva substitutes have been applied symptomatically
to alleviate mucosal discomfort and to air oral functioning.10 Artifical saliva substitutes usually contain carboxymethylcellulose
with or without the presence of natural mucins. Carboxymethylcellulose is used to impart lubrication and viscosity.
Saliva substitutes that contain natural mucins maintain a surface tension similar to that of natural salival. Salts
are added to artifical saliva to mimic the electrolyte content of natural saliva.15 According to Brastings,16mucin-containing
salivas are preferred by patients because carboxy-methylcellulose compounds seem to be uncomfortably sticky.
Preparations containing mucin are considered to provide formualtions that most closely resemble human saliva.17
When applied using an atomizer, saliva substitutes wet the oral cavity for about 30 minutes.18 In addition, intraoral
reserviors have been designed to allow continuous wetting of the oral surfaces. Recently, a denture with a palatal
reservoir for artificial saliva has been constructed. The reservoir holds 2&hyph;3 cc of substitute and needs to
be refilled every 2&hyph;5 hours.16 Several saliva substitutes are available and appear to be most successful when
used at night.3

Parasympathomimetic drugs have been used as pharmacologic sialagogues in the treatment of xerostomia. Fox et al4
demonstrated that in persons with documented salivary gland disease who have some functional salivary gland tissue,
an orally administered systemic agent is effective in relieving xerostomia and increasing silivary output. Orally
administered pilocarpine increases the production of saliva by parotid and submandibular or sublingual glands
and relieves the sensation of oral dryness. The investigators suggest that a sustained-release form of the drug may
offer increased therapeutic benefit. Scully11 recommends pyridostigmine because it is longer acting with fewer
side effects than other pharmacologic agents. According to Vissink et at14 the usefulness of pharmacologic sialagogues
is limited because of their side effects and contraindications.

By application of the concept of electrically stimulating nerves to elicit a response, electrostimulation was developed
for use in the oral cavity to stimulate the salivary reflex. Investigators have reported that electro-stimualtion
increases salivary output and should be used to treat patients with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome.37
The cost of a battery-operated, hand-held stimulus probe that can provide electrical stimulation to the tongue and
hard palate is approximately $1,500.



Rationale



Proponents of electrostimulation as a method to increase salivary production suggest that this procedure enhances
the patient's ability to generate saliva by augmenting normal physiologic salivary reflexes. Salivary secretion
is normally controlled by reflex stimulation with effector nerve impulses traveling along sympathetic as well as
parasympathetic nerves to the glands. Sympathetic nerve stimualtion produces a sparse viscous secretion, whereas
the parasympathetic nerve stimualtion produces a voluminous watery secretion.19 The dual secretion (saliva) is
a flued mixture produced from paired major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingulal) and many smaller
aggregations of minor salivary glands imbedded in the submucosa of the cheeks, lips, hard and soft palates, and tongue.

Proponents believe that xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome can be caused by interruption of the stimulus
that elicits salivation at the effector site; such interruption results from loss of glandular tissue with replacement
by round cell infiltration, scar, or fatty tissue. They postulate that an electronic device that touches the tongue
and roof of the mouth simultaneously will stimulate tactile receptors, taste receptors, and intrinsic muscle mechanoreceptors
within the mucosa of the dorsum of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. This produces electrical stimuation to the oral
and pharyngeal afferent nervous system resulting in a reflex volley of efferent impulses to all residual salivary
tissue, major and minor, in the oral and pharyngeal regions causing salivation.



Review of Available Literature



It has long been known that the nerves to salivary glands control the secretion of saliva. According to Garrett19 an
experiment in 1850 by Ludwig demonstraed that electrical stimulation of the chordalingual nerve in the dog caused
a copious secretion of submandibular saliva.

In 1986 Weiss et al7 reported on the use of an electronic stimulator as a mothod for increasing salivary production.
In this prelimianry investigation, 9 of the 24 patients with a primary complaint of xerostomia had Sjogren's syndrome
(diagnosed on the basis of mdical history only). Following a visual examination of the oral cavity as well as a gloved
finger test to determine the presence of moisture (any reflection was considered a sign of wetness), patients were
administered a 3-minute stimulus to the tongue and roof of the mouth with the probe (electrodes) of the hand-held stimulator.
The maximum voltage delivered by the device is 6V with a current of 9 &mu;A. Patient tolerance controls and determines
the level of stimulation. Two subsequent stimulations of 3 minutes each were conducted at the same sitting by most
of the patients (actual numbers not reported). Each stimulation procedure was followed by a subjective patient evaluation
of improvement and a repeat clinical examination.

According to the investigators, prior to stimulation, seven of the nine patients with Sjogren's syndrome were considered
to have slight amounts of moisture present, and the remaining two patients had ``no moisture'' present. Following
stimulation, all nine patients reported subjective impressions of increased salivation as compared with prestimulation
conditions. Clinical assessment was in agreement with the subjective patient evaluations. Weiss et al.7 reported
that the electronic device stimulates residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions, producing increased
salivation.
In 1988, Steller et al.3 conducted a study of electrical stimulation of salivary flow in patients with biopsy-proven
Sjogren's syndrome. The response to an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate was observed in a
randomized, double-blind, 4-week study of 29 subjects with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. To be eligible
to participate in the study, subjects had to have an unstimulated whole (total gland secretions) salivary flow rate
of less than 0.2 g/min. Patients were randomly assigned to active or placebo devices, which they used for 3 minutes,
three times a day for 4 weeks. Response to stimulation was assessed as whole saliva flow rates, which were measured
at weeks 0, 2, and 4, both before and after stimulation with the device.
According to the investigators, there were no statistically significant differences between changes in prestimulation
whole saliva flow rates or differences between the net changes in mean whole saliva flow rate (poststimulation minus
prestimulation flow) of the active and placebo groups at each visit. The investigators did find the changes in mean
poststimulation whole saliva flow rates between subjects using active and placebo devices from weeks 0 to 4 of the
study to be statistically significant. However, analysis of the results showed that the mean increase in the poststimulation
flow rate of the active device group (13 subjects) was due mainly to the responses of three subjects who showed marked
increases in their whole saliva flow rates during the study. The investigators noted that the initial salivary flow
rates of these subjects were the highest in that group, and their labial salivary gland focus scores were among the
lowest.
The investigators concluded that some Sjogren's syndrome patients with residual salivary flow show significant
responses to electrical stimulation, but others with low or absent whole saliva flow rates do not respond. During
the 4-week study period no change in the appearance of the oral mucosa was observed at the site of electrode placement,
and no marked changes or patterns of variation in subjects' pulse and blood pressure were observed before or after
the device was used.


Discussion


Xerostomia is a complaint of elderly individuals, particularly women.6 Decreases in both quantity of saliva as well
as composition cause a multitude of problems. In a healthy mouth, copious saliva containing essential electrolytes,
glycoproteins, and antimicrobial enzymes continually lubricates and protects the oral mucosa, thus cleaning the
mouth, regulating acidity, maintaining the integrity of the teeth, and destroying bacteria.
Currently, xerostomia is managed on the basis of subjective symptoms, evidence of reduction in salivary flow, and
complications that result from dry mouth. To alleviate some of the problems resulting from salivary dysfunction,
pharmacologic sialagogues such as pilocarpine and pyridostigmine as well as sialagogues that include sugarless
chewing gum, mints, or candy are prescribed in order to stimulate more salivary flow.18 Sialagogues are effective
only if salivary gland function is present.
The preliminary investigation by Weiss et al.7 in 1986 demonstrated that a probe providing electrical stimulation
applied to the tongue and hard palate of patients with xerostomia presumed secondary of Sjogren's syndrome produces
a salivary response. The salivary response was obtained in the nine patients following a single session of one to three
electrical stimulations of 3 minutes each. As a preliminary investigation, this study did not include a control group
or any quantitative assessment of salivary response, duration of response, or long-term assessment of efficacy.
Moreover, seven of the nine patients tested exhibited residual saliva production prior to treatment and may have
been exhibiting a tactile response to the probe.
The only other published report determining whether an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate
could stimulate salivary flow in subjects with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome is the randomized, double-blind,
4-week study reported by Steller et al. in 1988.3 The results of this short-term study indicate that some Sjogren's
patients with residual salivary flow in an unstimulated state (&lt;0.11&hyph;0.20 g/2 min) show a significant response
to electrical stimulation, but others with low (less than 0.11 g/2 min) or absent whole saliva rates do not respond
or respond to a clinically insignificant degree. Only 3 of 13 patients using the active device showed a significant
response (about 0.6&hyph;1.0 g/2 min) in salivary production when compared with the responses of the placebo group.
The whole saliva flow rates of the remaining 10 subjects in the active group remained below 0.25 g/2 min throughout
the study and were not of the order of magnitude necessary to indicate a significant salivary response. Whole saliva
flow rates of 10 subjects in the placebo group remained below 0.20 g/2 min throughout the study. It appears that additional
studies with larger patient populations are needed to define specific degrees of salivary function or dysfunction
that would respond to electrical stimulation. These studies could help to determine whether a single salivary response
to electro-stimulation or some other test such as lip biopsy focus score should be used to help identify those patients
who may benefit from the technique.

Guidelines that would specify which types of Sjogren's patients with what degree of xerostomia and at what points
in their clinical evaluation or management would benefit from electrostimulation cannot be developed without further
clinical investigation. Long-term studies of well-characterized patient groups will also help to determine how
long it takes to achieve a response. According to some investigators, this should allow sufficient time to determine
if any regeneration of the salivary gland parenchyma is achieved. In order to determine the effectiveness of electrical
stimulation of salivary flow in Sjogren's patients, studies should include information regarding concomitant
therapy (continued frequent water sipping or use of other sialagogues) and the duration of the salivary response
so that it can be compared with the use of other therapies. Studies and subsequent management of Sjogren's patients
with dry mouth should include quantitative assessment of salivary function (unstimulated and stimulated, whole
and individual gland salivas), assessment of oral conditions for signs of salivary hypofunction, and subjective
patient evaluations.
Salivary glands in patients who suffer from rheumatoid diseases show varying degrees of destruction. This damage
is progressive and considered irreversible by some investigators.17 The ability to induce secretion in individuals
with these conditions will be inversely related to the glandular damage. The study by Stellar et al3 shows that a device
providing electrical stimulation to treat dry mouth in patients with Sjogren's syndrome appears to be effective
after 4 weeks of study in only a small percentage of patients. These patients may represent a group with less advanced
disease (lesser degree of lymphocytic infiltration) and a greater amount of functional salivary parenchyma. These
individuals would likely respond equally well to mechanical, chemical, tactile, and pharmacologic means of salivary
stimulation. Anything that enhances mastication will induce secretion. So, too, will salts and citric acid solutions.
While all of these techniques are effective, their effects are transient; however, there have been no studies to demonstrate
that electrical stimulation provides any advantage or is more effective than other existing techniques.
Successful treatment for dry mouth is recorded as both subjective and objective increases in saliva output. According
to Fox et al,5 patient complaints of xerostomia or oral dryness may not reflect actual salivary gland capabilities
or function. Subjective assessments alone are not adequate for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Although there
is no fixed salivary level for intervention, xerostomia is generally associated with whole saliva flow rates of less
than 0.1 mL/min. For some patients, a 50% reduction in salivary output leads to the subjective impression of dry mouth.
However, the level of diminished salivary output where a patient becomes subject to increased risk of oral disease
or dysfunction is not known. Moreover, there is a wide variability of ``normal'' salivary output. A 50% decline for
one individual might still result in a flow rate greater than another individual's normal output. Some investigators
feel that if the minor salivary glands can be stimulated to coat the mucosa with a thin layer of mucous, the sensation
of dryness will be relieved. Even very small increases in saliva output may be beneficial in preventing or minimizing
the oral effects of salivary dysfunction. Long-term clinical studies are needed to examine these issues.



Consultations



According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), electrostimulation may be useful in management of salivary
hypofunction, but adequate data for definitive conclusions are not available. Electrostimulation is not widely
accepted as an effective method of treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. In addition, the number
of published studies is limited.
NIH has informed OHTA that guidelines that specify which types of xerostomic patients with which conditions and at
what points in their clinical evaluation and/or management would benefit from electrostimulation cannot be developed
without further clinical studies utilizing well-characterized patient populations. Given the single published
study showing that only patients with residual salivary flow in an unstimulated state will respond to electrostimulation,
NIH suspects that those individuals would likely respond as well to other means of salivary stimulation, including
gustatory or masticatory stimuli. NIH has expressed doubt as to whether electrostimulation using a limited stimulus
time (3 minutes, three times a day) could provide sufficient duration of increased salivary output to have a significant
impact on the oral health or symptoms of the patient.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has informed OHTA that in May 1988 a manufacturer received premarket approval
for a salivation electrostimulator device based upon submission20 of engineering, preclinical, and clinical studies
and the recommendation of the Dental Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The short-term
double-blind clinical study of the device was conducted at three institutions and included 40 patients using an active
device and 37 patients assigned a placebo. The work by Steller et al3 discussed in the literature review section is
part of this submission. Based on the data submitted, the FDA found an increase in saliva production from the patient
group using the active device compared with the patient group using the placebo device. Subjective improvement of
a burning sensation of the tongue was noted by 12 of 22 patients treated with the active device, and an improvement in
the ability to swallow was reported by 13 of these patients.
The manufacturer provided the FDA with a long-term clinical study of 34 patients with Sjogren's syndrome and xerostomia
that was intended to follow patients for up to 12 months. Patients were assessed by the physician for moisture (oral
examination) prior to the study and at visits on 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following stimulation. Eleven of 12 patients
who completed 12 months of electrical stimulation were found on the last visit to have a discernible improvement in
salivary status when compared with the initial assessment. As a followup to this study, a group of 23 patients was surveyed
by the manufacturer via telephone to assess changes in quality of life after using electrical stimulation for 6&hyph;18
months. Patients indicated improvement that included increased ease of swallowing and improved dental checkups
as well as education in burning tongue sensation, sleep interruptions, and water intake.
This device is indicated for use in patients with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome and intended to stimulate
salivary production from existing glandular tissue. Patients who show an initial response to electrostimulation
are considered to be candidates for this therapy. According to the FDA there are no contraindications associated
with the use of this device.


Medical Specialty and Clinician Responses


Medical specialty groups such as The American Dental Association were unable to provide any information regarding
the electrostimulation of salivary glands.
Comments from clinicians with knowledge of or experience with electrical stimulation of salivary production are
equivocal. Some expressed the opinion that electrostimulation is a safe and effective method for the treatment of
xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Others suggested that the method has been inadequately tested. Some
clinicians recommended beginning electrical stimulation of the salivary glands in patients with Sjogren's syndrome
and dry mouth early in the course of the disease in order to possibly prevent, modify, or even reverse the progression
of a salivary gland atrophy. Other clinicians are not convinced that electrostimulation is more effective than other
simple, less costly stimulation techniques such as gustatory stimulation or intraoral tactile stimulation.


Summary


Electrostimulation has been introduced as a technique for increasing salivary output in the treatment of patients
with xerostomia (dry mouth) secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. The procedure uses an electrostimulation device (salivation
electrostimulator) to increase salivary production from existing glandular tissue. The device delivers a low-voltage
electrical stimulus to the mouth via a probe. Patients with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions
who demonstrate a decrease in the flow rate of saliva are potential candidates for this procedure.
It is estimated that more than one million people in the United States, predominantly middle-aged and elderly women,
suffer from Sjogren's syndrome. Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness
and have difficulty eating dry foods. These patients are susceptible to increased caries, oral pain, infection,
and have difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing.
The approach to the treatment of xerostomia in Sjogren's patients is usually determined by the level of severity of
the symptoms. Appropriate management of patients with xerostomia requires that those patients whose salivary flow
can be increased by means of sialagogues be distinguished from those patients whose salivary flow is either unaffected
or insufficiently stimulated. To alleviate some of the complications due to salivary dysfunction in those patients
who respond to stimuli, pharmocologic sialagogues as well as sialagogues that include sugarless gums, mints and
candies are prescribed in order to increase salivary flow.
Recently, electrostimulation via a hand-held stimulus probe has been introduced as a method of treatment in xerostomia
secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. From the single published study as well as data provided to the FDA, it appears that
an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate (by a battery-operated device) may be useful in the management
of salivary hypofunction in certain patients. It appears, however, that there are insufficient data at the present
time to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness
of this modality of salivary production, or to identify those xerostomic patients who would benefit from this procedure.
Also, electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective method of treatment for xerostomia secondary to
Sjogren's syndrome. The number of published studies is limited and other less expensive treatments are available.
Further research of electrical stimulation of salivary flow is required to determine its role in the treatment of
Sjogren's patients with xerostomia.

 Notice of available funds.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA) announces the availability of approximately $8.7 million in discretionary grants for noncompeting continuation
and competing grants for fiscal year (FY) 1994. The funds will be awarded under Section 340A of the Public Health Service
(PHS) Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 256a. 



The purpose of these grants is to provide primary health services, as defined in section 330(b)(1) of the PHS Act, including
health screenings, and health counseling and education services to residents of public housing. 

In addition, approximately $500,000 will be available in FY 1994 for a demonstration effort co-sponsored by the Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Office of Minority Health (OMH), located in the Office of the
Assistant Secretary 
for Health. This activity will assist in implementing section 1707(d)(1) of the PHS Act and will enable public housing
grantees to organize and operate Minority Community Health Coalitions (MCHC) and to implement HIV/AIDS health education
and prevention strategies. 

The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000,
a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement is related to the priority area
of improving access to health services for minorities and disadvantaged Americans in underserved areas. Potential
applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or
Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402&hyph;9325 (telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238).

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Public Housing Primary Care Program 



Approximately $8.7 million is available for awards. It is anticipated that the above funds will be awarded to support
up 
to 7 noncompeting continuation grants ranging from $217,667 to $375,000, and up to 14 competing grants, ranging from
$125,000 to $775,000 each for a project period of up to three years. 



Eligible Entities 



To be eligible, an applicant must be a public or nonprofit private entity and have the capacity to effectively administer
this grant program. In an area where there are 
a certified Resident Management Corporation (RMC) and public or private nonprofit entities providing primary health
services, including those receiving funds under sections 330 or 340 of 
the PHS Act, the organizations are encouraged to submit only 
one application demonstrating collaboration between 
the respective organizations. 



Applicable Requirements 



Grantees providing primary health services directly and organizations with whom grantees contract to provide primary
health services must be participating and qualified providers under the Medicaid plan approved under Title XIX of
the Social Security Act, and must maximize payment for services available from private insurance, Medicare, other

Federal programs, and other third-party sources. Grantees entering into contracts for services may be granted a
waiver of this requirement if the organization they contract with does not impose a charge or accept payment available
from any third-party payor, including payment under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits
program, including Medicaid. 

The Secretary may not make a grant to an applicant unless 
the applicant signs an agreement indicating that, whether 
the services are provided directly or through contract, services under the grant will be provided without regard
to ability to pay for the services. Further, if a charge is imposed, it will: (1) be made according to a schedule of charges
that is made available to the public; (2) not be imposed on any resident of public housing with an income less than the
official poverty level; and (3) be adjusted to reflect the income and resources of 
the resident. 

For applicants which are public entities (e.g., State or local health departments or institutions of higher education)
the Secretary may not award a grant unless the public entity agrees that, with respect to the costs to be incurred by
such entity in carrying out the purposes of the grant, the entity will make available non-Federal contributions in
cash toward such costs in an amount equal to $1.00 for each $1.00 of Federal funds. 
In-kind contributions will not constitute acceptable contributions. Also, funds provided by the Federal Government,
or services assisted or subsidized by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of the
non-Federal contributions. 



Project Requirements 



The following services are required by Section 340A and must 
be provided either directly or through contract: 

(1) Primary health care services, as defined in section 330(b)(1) of the PHS Act, including health screening, and
health counseling and education services for residents of public housing, on the premises of public housing projects
or at other locations immediately accessible to residents of public housing; 

(2) Referral of residents, as appropriate, to qualified facilities and practitioners for necessary field services;


(3) Outreach services to inform residents of the availability of such services (especially high risk women of child-bearing
age); and 

(4) Aid to residents in establishing eligibility for assistance under entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid; Women,
Infants and Children program; Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and in obtaining services, under Federal,
State and local programs providing health services, mental health services, or social services. 

In addition, applicants may also provide the following optional services: 

(1) Training of public housing residents to provide health screening and educational services; and 

(2) Health services to individuals who are not residents of public housing, if those services will be provided to such
individuals under the same terms and conditions as such services are provided to the residents. 



Restrictions on the Use of Grant Funds 



The following restrictions apply to the use of grants funds: 

(1) The applicant may not expend more than 10 percent of 
the Federal grant funds for the purpose of administering 
the grant; 

(2) Grant funds may not be used for inpatient services;

counseling and education services; and

(4) Grant funds may not be used to purchase or improve real property (other than minor remodeling of improvements to
existing real property) or to purchase major medical equipment or motor vehicles.






Note: 

Upon request by the applicant, demonstrating that the purposes of the project cannot otherwise be carried out, the
Secretary may waive the restriction in paragraph [4].




In selecting applicants for funding, preference is mandated by legislation and will be given to applicants that are:
(1) Resident Management Corporations (RMC) as defined under Section 20 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; or (2) entities
receiving funds under either Section 330 of the PHS Act (Community Health Centers) or Section 340 of the PHS Act (Health
Care for the Homeless Programs).

II. Minority Community Health Coalition Demonstration Program Related to HIV/AIDS Centered Education and Prevention




Funding 



Grant awards for the Minority Community Health Coalition (MCHC) program will be made for amounts up to approximately
$100,000 each for approximately 5 new projects for up to 3 years. A special initiative exists between the Office of
Minority Health (OMH) and the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) aimed specifically at the Section 340A Public Housing
Primary Care (PHPC) grantees. Only those grantees or applicants approved for FY 1994 funding, who have not previously
received OMH/MCHC funds, are eligible for MCHC grants. Proposals for this OMH supplemental program must be submitted
as part of the application for the PHPC grant. 



Project Requirements 



Grantees will be required: To develop community health coalitions; to identify minority-targeted health education
and prevention strategies; and to implement the strategies they have identified. These strategies will help eliminate
or reduce the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV, and other health problems that are acquired and/or transmitted
or associated with similar risk behaviors. The categories must include tuberculosis (TB), substance abuse and sexually-transmitted
diseases (STD), and hepatitis B. Although TB is not directly related to risk behaviors underlying HIV transmission,
it is a serious health problem aggravated by HIV infection. It warrants special attention in HIV education/prevention
information because of its high level of communicability. 



Evaluation Criteria 



Proposals for the demonstration program will be evaluated on the following: 

(1) The relative need of the population to be served for the proposed HIV/AIDS centered education/prevention program;


(2) The adequacy of the proposed plan to assure the development and operation of an effective coalition, which should
include involvement of the target population; 

(3) The appropriateness of coordination and linkages with State and local health departments and other existing
HIV-related activities such as the federally funded Ryan White Consortia; 

(4) The appropriateness of the proposed staffing pattern;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-2-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-2-00041 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) The adequacy of community commitment and coordination 
to develop the proposed coalition, including evidence of appropriate community participation and endorsement,
and documentation of commitment, e.g., MOAs and MOUs; 

(6) The reasonableness of the proposed budget and adequacy of the budget justification; 

(7) The adequacy of the evaluation plan in measuring the coalition's effectiveness in a quantifiable fashion; and


(8) The extent to which the demonstration activity will be coordinated with the activities under the Public Housing
Primary Health Care program. 



Eligibility 



Only those grantees or applicants approved for FY 1994 funding, who have not previously received OMH/MCHC funds,
are eligible for MCHC grants. 



Other Award Information 



This program has been determined to be a program which is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented
by 
45 CFR part 100. Executive Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from
within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kit, to be made available under
this notice, will contain a listing of States which have chosen to set up a review system and will provide a State point
of contact (SPOC) in 
the State for that review. Applicants (other than Federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact
their SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions
on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, 
the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations
is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline date. The BPHC does not guarantee that it will accommodate or
explain its response to State process recommendations received after the due date. 



Public Health System Reporting Requirement 



This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirement (reporting requirements have been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget_0937&hyph;0195). Under this requirement, the community-based nongovernmental
applicant must prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement (PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide
information to State and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed health services grant applications
submitted by community-based nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions. 

Community-based nongovernmental applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the
appropriate State and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than the Federal application receipt
due date: 

(1) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424). 

(2) A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, which provides: 

a. A description of the population to be served; 

b. A summary of the services to be provided; and 

c. A description of the coordination planned with 
the appropriate State and local health agencies. 




The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this program is 93.927.

Part A: Justification 



President Clinton has pledged an additional 100,000 police officers by 1998. The Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) has been directed by the White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC) and the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) to assist in fulfilling that pledge by providing for 4,100 police-equivalent positions in 1994 and
5,000 position per year between 1995&hyph;1998 (see Attachment One). 

The primary HUD programs that permit the funding of law enforcement and security officers are the Public Housing Drug
Elimination Grant (PHDEP), Community Development Block Grant, Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program
(CIAP), Comprehensive Grants (Comp Grant), and operating subsidies. From those programs, HUD is expected to provide
the positions outlined above. OMB assumes that HUD will use $124 million in budget authority in FY 1994 and $150 million
for FYs 1995&hyph;1998 to fund these positions. 



A1.0&blank;Circumstances That Make Collection Of The Information Necessary 



The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) administers four of the five programs identified above. The programs
fund the activities of only public and Indian housing authorities (HAs). PIH does not currently have the mechanisms
to measure or determine the costs or specific number of law enforcement and security personnel our grant monies are
supporting. 

The Public Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) funds a variety of public housing anti-drug efforts, including
the hiring of law enforcement and security officers. Since program inception in 1989 the PHDEP has funded 1762 grants
totalling $532,459,075 million. According to the plans of the FY 1991 to FY 1993 grantees, approximately $178 million
of the funds were targeted to additional security or law enforcement staff. Over the same period, the proportion of
total dollars targeted specifically to additional law enforcement and security costs has remained about the same
each year. 

While PHDEP grantees are required to submit semi-annual reports on the status of grant activities and funding, the
level of detail varies greatly, and the information is only reviewed on a grant by grant basis, and is not collected
or concatenated on a field office, regional office or national basis. Information from PHDEP semi-annual reports
are insufficient sources because the reports are not standardized and several other PIH funding sources pay for police/security
costs. 

In FY 1993, CIAP grants totalled $326 million, and are currently being phased out. The reports required from CIAP grantees
report ``anti-drug costs'', but do not include anti-crime costs, and do not separate labor from other related costs.


In FY 1993, Comp Grants totalled $2.5 billion. The Comp Grant program allows costs for ``health and safety'', but none
of the Comp Grant reports capture any information on security and law enforcement personnel costs. 

Public Housing Operating Subsidy (O/S) can also be used to pay for ``Protective Services'', including labor, materials,
and contract costs. In FY 1992, nationwide, $108.2 million were spent on all protective services costs. Of those funds,
$71.9 were spent on labor, and $32.7 on security contract costs. Since FY 1987, the dollars spent on labor costs by all
housing authorities has increased by 44 percent from $49.8 to $71.9 million, while the dollars spend on security contract
costs has increased by 42 percent from $76.1 million to $108.2 million. HUD does not collect information at any level
of greater detail. 

The Law Enforcement/Security Form for which OMB approval is sought would be required from HAs annually. Use of this
form will enable the level of law enforcement and security support to be shown in a consistent manner, through annual
compilation of the requested data. The planned characteristics of the form are for reporting at the agency level.
HAs will report on the funds and positions relative to the relevant grants they are operating.

A2.0&blank;How and by Whom the Data Will be Used
A2.1&blank;Purpose of the Data Collection


The Department will use this information for several purposes. Primarily the data will be used to report to the Secretary,
and in turn to the Domestic Policy Council of the White House, HUD's contribution to the Administration's effort to
increase the number of law enforcement officers by 100,000 by 1998.
The Department will also analyze the information to better understand the contribution of public housing funds to
local law enforcement efforts. A recent HUD technical assistance contract addressing the issues of law enforcement
and public housing show an increasing financial commitment by HAs to pay for law enforcement and security services.
Two major policy issues are raised by these HUD funds paying for security and law enforcement personnel: comparable
level of law enforcement services provided by local government, and liability. Many of the financial commitments
by HAs show evidence of public housing communities which do not receive a comparable level of law enforcement services
from local government, as required by the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC), or HAs paying additional costs disproportionate
to the additional services received. HAs compensate for the lower level of services by paying for additional officers
or security. HUD is interested in understanding this issue, and assisting HAs to negotiate for the required comparable
level of services, and for any additional services.
Liability has also been raised as a major policy issue. If HUD grantees are using HUD funds to pay for law enforcement
and security personnel, it could be incumbent upon the Department to ensure that all legal and insurance matters are
adequately addressed by grantees before financial and contractual commitments are made for law enforcement and
security services. Without any knowledge of the extent of those commitments, and which HAs are making those commitments,
HUD cannot develop an adequate response for technical assistance and training.
As HUD funds are increasingly targeted to law enforcement and security costs, the Department needs to understand
and develop appropriate policies to assist HAs in the development of safe and secure environments. Without an understanding
of current commitments and their shifts from year to year, the Department will not be able to develop effective program
or technical assistance responses to HAs with inadequate law enforcement an security coverage.

A2.2&blank;Consequences If the Information Was Not Collected



If the Department were not to collect this information it would be considered unresponsive to the President's request,
it would continue to lack the necessary information to understand the nature and extent of potential liability and
to assist housing authorities in negotiating for a comparable level of local government law enforcement services.



A3.0&blank;Use of Improved Information Technologies



The required information can be submitted to HUD Headquarters in two formats. The first will be a bulletin board format
with direct on-land access from HAs to HUD Headquarters. The bulletin board format will be the same as the hard copy
form seen in Attachment 2. The second and alternative format will be a one-page hard copy form as attached in Attachment
2. The form will be machine-readable and will be submitted directly to the Office of Public and Indian Housing at HUD
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. where the form will be scanned electronically and the information stored in a database
for future use.



A4.0&blank;Efforts to Identify Duplication



The Department has examined existing data sources, such as the grant applications and semi-annual reports for public
housing competitive programs including PHDEP, CIAP, and Comp Grant, as well as Operating Subsidy reports. The required
data are not consistently available in any of these sources because none require the reporting of law enforcement
and security expenditures specifically (see A1.0 above).

In the pretest conducted by the Office of Public and Indian Housing with nine housing authorities, most respondents
indicated that housing authorities have the necessary information, but do not keep the information in a central location.



A5.0&blank;Why Similar Already Available Data Cannot Be Used



As discussed in Section A1.0 above, similar, already available data does not exist. Current HUD-required reports
from HAs do not capture security and law enforcement personnel information as required by the department.



A6.0&blank;Effort to Minimize the Burden for Small Entities



The set of indicators in the form represents funding sources and budgets most commonly used by housing authorities,
including small housing authorities. Review of the drug elimination grants (DEGs) by the Office of Public and Indian
Housing shows that smaller housing authorities with DEGs are just as likely to have DEG funds targeted to law enforcement
or security costs. The likelihood of smaller housing authorities using other HUD grant fund to support law enforcement
or security costs is unknown because of the lack of information as outlined in Section A1.0.



A7.0&blank;Consequences of Less Frequent Data Collection



Because the Domestic Policy Council has asked the Department to report on its annual contribution to the President's
pledge of 100,000 more law enforcement officers, annual reporting should be sufficient, and less frequent reporting
would not allow the Department to report as required.



A8.0&blank;Circumstances Requiring Deviation From Guidelines In 5 CFR 1310.6



The proposed monitoring system is consistent with the guidelines set forth in 5 CFR 1310.6 (Controlling Paperwork
Burdens on the Public_General Information Collection Guidelines). There are not circumstances that require deviation
from these guidelines.



A9.0&blank;Consultations Outside of the Agency



To aid in the preparation of the PHDEP Outcome Monitoring System, the Department has conferred with Carroll Buracker
of Fredericksburg, VA, leading authority in law enforcement services. Mr. Buracker provided valuable comments
in the definition of different types of security and law enforcement officers more suitable for public housing authorities,
and those changes have been incorporated into the document. The Department has also conferred with several public
housing authorities, receiving suggestions for clearer instructions and use of terms including definitions of
FTE, time frames, and local government. These have been incorporated into the document, and will be incorporated
into the instructions.



A10.0&blank;Arrangements and Assurances Regarding Confidentiality



The Department will develop a HUD Notice to accompany the form explaining that the information reported will be used
by HUD to measure HUD support of national law enforcement and security personnel costs.



A11.0&blank;Sensitive Questions



No questions of a sensitive nature are included in the proposed report.

<TEXT>
 

Staff of the Department of Housing and Urban Development developed the form and will collect and concatenate the data.
There will be no additional contractual cost to the government.



A13.0&blank;Respondent Burden



All public and Indian housing authorities which expend HUD funds on law enforcement or security staff will be required
to collect the data and submit the report annually. Currently HUD does not anticipate more than 1200 HAs to have to complete
more than the first part of the form. The initial set-up or modification of one housing agency's data collection system
is estimated to take three working days (24 hours). Once the collection system is in place, the annual burden for one
grantee, including time to prepare data and complete the form is 8 hours. The total annual burden program-wide will
vary based on the number of housing authorities which use HUD funds to pay for law enforcement or security staff, which
is not anticipated to be more than 1200 HAs.




Name of Reporting Form: Public Housing Law Enforcement/Security Form

Respondent: All public and Indian housing authorities

Number of Respondents: 3300

Estimated Time in Hours: Initial set-up: 24 hours; subsequent reporting 8 hours/year.

Frequency in Reporting: Annual.

Annual Burden (In Hours): For 1200 housing authorities, 28,800 hours for initial setup plus 9,600 hours/year for
subsequent reporting.






Note: 

The reporting requirements for small housing agencies (under 1,250 units) are somewhat less, as they are less likely
to have used more than one HUD funding source to pay for law enforcement and security activities.



A14.0&blank;Reasons For Change In Burden



This is a new reporting form and therefore this section is not applicable.



A15.0&blank;Tabulation Plans, Statistical Analysis, Study Schedule and Publication



The concatenation and analysis of the results is intended for use by the program staff at the Department to monitor
shifts.

The concatenation and analysis of the results is intended for use by the program staff at the Department to monitor
shifts in the use of funds and to report to Congress and the White House. As part of ongoing program monitoring, the data
gathered may be tabulated and used periodically to assess the overall effectiveness of HUD funds in national efforts
at increased law enforcement. Currently, there are no plans for such a formal assessment based on this report.



PART B. Sampling and Response



The Public Housing Law Enforcement and Security Form (PHLESF) is designed to collect information from the universe
of public and Indian housing authorities. No sampling will be done.

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following public lands in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, have been examined and found suitable for classification
for conveyance to Rio Blanco County under the provisions of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (43 U.S.C. 869 

et seq.

), as amended by the Recreation and Public Purposes Amendment Act of 1988. Rio Blanco County proposes to use the lands
for a solid waste landfill.


Sixth Principal Meridian, Colorado


T. 2N., T. 97 W.,


Sec. 25, NW1/4, N1/2NE1/4SW1/4, NE1/4NW1/4SW1/4;
Sec. 26, E1/2E1/2NE1/4.



Containing 230 acres.




All minerals, excluding the oil and gas, will be conveyed concurrently with the surface estate, pursuant to section
209(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719(b)).
The lands are not needed for federal purposes. Conveyance is consistent with current BLM land use planning, and would
be in the public interest. The patent, when issued, will be subject to the following terms, conditions, and/or reservations:
1. Provisions of the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, the Recreation and Public Purposes Amendment Act, and all
applicable regulations of the Secretary of the Interior.
2. A right-of-way reservation for ditches and canals constructed by authority of the United States under the Act of
August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).
3. Rio Blanco County, its successors or assigns, assumes all liability for and shall defend, indemnify, and save harmless
the United States and its officers, agents, representatives, and employees (hereinafter referred to in this clause
as the United States), from all claims, loss, damage, actions, causes of action, expense, and liability (hereinafter
referred to in this clause as claims) resulting from, brought for or on account of, any personal injury, threat of personal
injury, or property damage received or sustained by any person or persons (including the patentee's employees) or
property growing out of, occurring, or attributable directly or indirectly, to the disposal of solid waste on, or
the release of hazardous substances from the above described lands, regardless of whether such claims shall be attributable
to: (1) The concurrent, contributory, or partial fault, failure, or negligence of the United States, (2) the sole
fault, failure, or negligence of the United States.
4. Compliance with all Federal and State laws applicable to the disposal, placement, or release of hazardous substances.
5. Title shall revert to the United States upon a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the patentee
has not substantially developed the lands in accordance with the approved plan of development on or before the date
five years after the date of conveyance. No portion of the land shall under any circumstance revert to the United States
if any such portion has been used for solid waste disposal or for any other purpose which may result in the disposal,
placement, or release of any hazardous substance.
6. If, at any time, the patentee transfers to another party ownership of any portion of the land not used for the purpose(s)
specified in the application and approved plan of development, the patentee shall pay the Bureau of Land Management
the fair market value, as determined by the authorized officer, of the transferred portion as of the date of transfer,
including the value of any improvements thereon.
7. Oil and gas shall be reserved to the United States, together with the right to prospect for and remove the same.
8. A reservation of title to all archaeological and paleontological resources within the above described property,
together with such right of ingress and egress, and temporary occupancy as is necessary to identify, inventory, monitor,
preserve, protect, mitigate, and remove any of said resources within or from the described property. No construction
or other intentional surface disturbance, except emergency response, may take place on lands where identified archaeologic
or paleologic sites have been identified without prior written authorization from the United States. The United
States may release any or all of the described property from this reservation at any time that it determines, in consultation
with the State Historic Preservation Officer, that the property being released is no longer eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places or does not contain significant archaeological or paleological resources.
Detailed information concerning this action is available for review at the office of the Bureau of Land Management,
White River Resource Area, 73544 Highway 64, Meeker, Colorado.
Upon Publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, the lands will be segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the general mining
laws, except for conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, conveyance under section 209(b) of the
Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and leasing under the mineral leasing laws.
For a period of 45 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, interested persons may submit comments regarding the proposed conveyance or classification of the lands to the
District Manager, Craig District Office, 455 Emerson Street, Craig Colorado 81625.
Classification Comments: Interested parties may submit comments involving the suitability of the land for solid
waste landfill purposes. Comments on the classification are restricted to whether the land is physically suited
for the proposal, whether the use will maximize the future use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with
local planning and zoning, or if the use is consistent with State and Federal programs.
Application Comments: Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the application
and plan of development, whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the decision, or
any other factor not directly related to the suitability of the land for a solid waste landfill.
Any adverse comments will be reviewed by the State Director. In the absence of any adverse comments, the classification
will become effective 60 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>General Management Plan; Haleakala National Park; Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>




Summary: 

Pursuant to Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190 as amended),
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS)
assessing the potential impacts of the proposed General Management Plan for Haleakala National Park, Maui County,
Hawaii. 



The proposed action would add adjacent lands to the park containing significant natural and cultural resources to
permit visitor access and to ensure the long term protection of park resources. The proposal also includes needed
improvements to visitor services to be carried out through the development of a limited amount of new facilities and
the upgrading of existing facilities. Research programs are also called for in the proposal to refine and supplement
the existing resource data base. 

Two alternative plans are being considered. One is a no action alternative which calls for a continuation of current
operations with no upgrading or development of park infrastructure. The other is a minimum requirements alternative
which calls for the same level of facility upgrading and development as the proposal, but adds substantially less
land. 




Supplementary Information: 

Written comments on the draft general management plan and DEIS will be accepted until July 30, 1994. Public meetings
on the draft plan will be scheduled at different locations on the Island of Maui, including Kahului and Hana, during
the month of June. The times, dates, and specific locations of these meetings will be announced in local newspapers
several weeks in advance. Park Service officials will be available at the meetings to present the plan, receive oral
and written comments, and answer questions. 



Inquiries on the draft general management plan and DEIS should be directed to the Superintendent, Haleakala National
Park, P.O. Box 369, Makawao, Maui, Hawaii 96768. The park telephone number is (808) 572&hyph;9306. 
Copies of the draft Plan and DEIS are available at the park headquarters at the above address. Copies are also available
for inspection at public libraries on Maui, at the State Library in Honolulu, and at the Western Regional Office, National
Park Service, 600 Harrison St., suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107&hyph;1372.

Chicago and North Western Transportation Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Monroe County, IA 



Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (CNW) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart
F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon approximately 1.5 miles of rail line between the old Burlington Northern crossing
at Maxon (previously designated as old railroad milepost 323.1) and the former Norfolk Southern connection at Albia
(previously designated as old railroad milepost 324.6), in Monroe County, IA.
 
CNW has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or
with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements
at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic requirement), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49
CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met.

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expressions of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on June 22, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental
issues,

1

 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),

2

 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29

3

 must be filed by June 2, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be
filed by June 13, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington,
DC 20423.

A stay will be routinely issued by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental
issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation)
cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See 

Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines,

 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request
as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this
exemption.

<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of availability of technical assistance.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Department of Labor (DOL) is announcing the availability of non-monetary technical assistance to Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA) service providers. The Center for Employment Training (CET) is being funded by DOL to provide
such technical assistance to replicate the CET Job Training Model. Up to 7 service providers will receive assistance
in developing and implementing the CET Job Training Model for use within the JTPA system. All interested parties must
participate in an information seminar prior to selection.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
dates:

 The training will run from August through December 31, 1994. An information seminar will be held at CET's headquarters
in San Jose, California, on June 29 through July 1, 1994. All interested service providers must: (1) Contact CET to
arrange to attend the information seminar scheduled (or make alternative informal arrangements) if the organization
has not previously attended one, and by July 15, the organization must submit in writing to the Department of Labor
at the address below, the organization's intent to apply for this technical assistance award; (2) if the organization
has previously attended a CET information seminar, it need not attend another information seminar, but, by July 15,
the organization must submit in writing to the Department of Labor at the address below the organization's intent
to apply for this technical assistance award; and (3) by July 19, to apply for the technical assistance, the organization
must submit an original and four copies of a brief, but thorough, application to the Department of Labor at the address
below, discussing the criteria as required below. Packages shall be postmarked by the dates established above.


</DATE>

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The Center for Employment Training (CET) offers a unique training program which challenges standard notions of training
the disadvantaged. It is a holistic approach to train the hardest-to-serve through an integrated program of contextual
learning. CET focuses on job training, but combines basic education and related services in context with this core
training. This method of learning was endorsed by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills. Further,
CET's program is unique in that it is accessible to all, with no entry tests or creaming. This represents the direction
of the 1992 JTPA amendments, which stress targeting of services to those most in need and intensifying and improving
the quality of services offered. The CET design, as implemented through this replication, will reflect the key provisions
of the new program design such as assessment and individual service strategy. In addition, CET is widely recognized
as one of the most effective job training programs in the country. CET's program serving minority single mothers was
credited with the most positive outcomes in a comprehensive study funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Additionally,
recent research with school dropouts, in the JOBSTART study conducted by Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation
(MDRC), also came up with strong positive impacts and provides growing evidence of the effectiveness of CET's program.


Technical assistance will be provided to up to 7 sites to replicate the CET job training model. This technical assistance
award will provide for the training and technical assistance for local entities which are selected to operate the
CET model program. This award is made as a modification to an existing DOL&hyph;CET agreement that presently provides
for training and technical assistance to 10 sites. Technical assistance is being provided to develop a CET-model
base within the JTPA system that could provide for: A technical assistance capacity within the JTPA system; opportunity
to uncover obstacles in implementing CET-model programs under JTPA; and the opportunity to delineate aspects of
the model which provide the greatest benefit to JTPA participants.
Selected organizations would enter into agreements with the Center for Employment Training to receive the technical
assistance required for the development and start-up of the local CET model program. This is a non-monetary award.
The technical assistance award includes the local and CET on-site training to enable an organization to start its
own CET model program. Training would be provided during the months of August through December. The award covers the
cost of CET's services and most traveling that will be required of CET and of the service providers. However, start-up
costs, including site development and preliminary staffing, will be the responsibility of the selected service
providers. Operation costs of the model program also are not included and are expected to come from the organizations'
regular JTPA and other funding. Additional resources may be necessary and may be obtainable from local foundations.
CET will assist selected sites in finding additional funding sources, if necessary.
This award is to provide services to the JTPA community. Eligible applicants are limited to service delivery area
(SDA) administrative entities who run their own training programs, consortiums of service providers, not-for-profit
organizations, community-based organizations as defined under Section 4 of JTPA and local education organizations.
Two types of applications will be accepted: (1) Applications from SDA administrative entities, and (2) joint applications
with one party being the SDA administrative entity and the other being an organization listed above. Applications
that do not include the local SDA administrative entity will not be accepted. This process is to ensure that all service
providers have coordinated with their JTPA funding stream and that the SDA administrative entity has committed to
funding the program the service provider is being trained to operate.

Information Seminar



JTPA service providers that are interested in receiving such technical assistance to develop and start operations
on their own CET model job training program must, as stated above, contact CET at the address listed above, to arrange
attendance at the information seminar. Attendance at the information seminar is restricted to those individuals
who have the capacity to make decisions of participation for their organizations. Although for the 7 selected organizations
most funds required for future travel to CET's headquarters in San Jose are provided for in the CET and DOL agreement,
the initial costs to attend the information seminars are not covered. CET will assist in making these travel arrangements;
however, all costs are the responsibility of the individual service providers.



Application Process



Selection of service providers will be based upon criteria in three categories: Eligibility, competitiveness,
and additional factors discussed above. In order to be considered, an applicant must meet each of the criteria under
the eligibility section. The information received under the competitive issues section will be used to rank applications.
After all applications are ranked, the additional factors discussed below will be used to select a diverse group of
sites. 



I. Eligibility



(1) All entities must be or become JTPA service providers. All providers that are not JTPA administrative entities
must submit their applications jointly with the SDA administrative entity. This joint application with the service
delivery area administrative entity should show that the service provider is or will be receiving JTPA funds during
Program Year 1994, (July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995). The application should elaborate on the relationship between
the service provider and the administrative entity. This should include descriptions of previous services, previous
and current JTPA funding levels, and discuss the level of cooperation between the provider and the administrative
entity. Further, any local procurement procedures, including those for a noncompetitive award, if applicable,
that will be required to be met for starting and completing this project should be detailed in the application. A timeline
for the procurement process should be provided. Applicants must be able to show that there is funding available to
the proposed service provider. Given the short time frame for the technical assistance (August through December),
procurement activities should be initiated as soon as possible. To simplify and speed up the procurement process,
it is suggested that SDA administrative entities, that do not wish to run their own program, consider modifying a current
service provider's existing agreement to convert their present training program to the CET model. 

(2) All entities must state that they are willing to participate in evaluation studies and to fully implement the core
CEP job training model.



II. Competitiveness



Applications will be judged equally based upon (1) the organization's level of commitment to the replication project,
and (2) the apparent capacity of the organization to succeed with the replication. Measures of this commitment include
but are not limited to, cooperative relationships with the JTPA administrative entity (in those instances where
the service provider is not the administrative entity), coordination with the State JTPA organization, coordination
with other programs or activities for the JTPA eligible population, including Job Opportunities and Basic Skills
Training (JOBS), funds available for this project, evidence of research into additional funding sources, ability
of the service provider to operate the program in the future and private sector involvement in project. Measures of
organizational capacity include, but are not limited to, the number of clients the service provider intends to serve,

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;382]</RINDOCK>



Entergy Operations, Inc.

Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;38, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the Waterford Steam
Electric Station, Unit 3 (Waterford), located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed amendment would revise 10 CFR part 20 references to reflect the new section numbers, change administrative
controls for reporting and recordkeeping to achieve compliance with the new part 20, and revise definitions to ensure
consistency with 10 CFR part 20. The change would revise the limitations on concentrations of radioactive material
released in liquid effluents and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in
gaseous effluents. The site boundary definition would be revised to exclude the areas over water as part of the unrestricted
area, and the high-radiation area definition would be revised to meet the intent of the NRC draft generic letter, ``Guidance
for Modification of Technical Specifications to Reflect (A) Revisions to 10 CFR Part 20, `Standards for Protection
Against Radiation' and 10 CFR 50.36(a), `Technical Specifications of Effluents from Nuclear Power Reactors,' (B)
Related Current Industry Initiatives, and (C) Miscellaneous Related Editorial Clarifications,''. These changes
are in response to the licensee's application for amendment dated February 11, 1994, implementing the new 10 CFR part
20.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed for the licensee to retain operational flexibility, as far as is consistent with 10 CFR
part 50, appendix I, in implementing the revised 10 CFR part 20.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



With regard to the actual release rates (referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS) as a dose rate to the maximally
exposed member of the public), the proposed revision will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that may be
released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
amendment to the TS, any alternative to the amendment will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment.
Denying the amendment would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to the operation of Waterford, dated September 1991.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated February 11, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, and
at the University of New Orleans Library, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122.

Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>




Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, has issued a Director's Decision
concerning a Petition dated October 23,1992, filed by Thomas J. Saporito, Jr., under &sect;2.206 of Title 10 of the
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 2.206). The petition contained statements and allegations regarding the main
steam and pressurizer safety valves and other matters regarding the operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station (Palo Verde). The Petition requested that the three Palo Verde units be immediately shut down until such time
as a safety evaluation can be performed on the safety valves at Palo Verde. The Petition also requested that the NRC
initiate a proceeding to show cause why the operating licenses for the Palo Verde units should not be modified, suspended,
or revoked. In a supplement to the Petition dated January 4, 1993, Petitioner also requested that the NRC take appropriate
enforcement action against Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee) and deny the license amendment application
dated November 13, 1990, regarding revised setpoint tolerances for the main steam and pressurizer safety valves.

The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation has determined that the requests should be denied for the
reasons stated in the ``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;04), which is available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555,
and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona
85004.

A copy of the decision has been filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance
with 10 CFR 2.206(c). As provided therein, this decision will become the final action of the Commission 25 days after
issuance unless the Commission, on its own motion, institutes review of the decision within that time.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3; Issuance of Amendment
to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 75 to Facility Operating License No.
NPF&hyph;41, Amendment No. 61 to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;51, and Amendment No. 47 to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;74, issued to Arizona Public Service Company, Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement
and Power District, El Paso Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, Public Service Company of New
Mexico, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Public Power Authority (licensees), which
revised the Technical Specifications for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2,
and 3 located in Maricopa County, Arizona. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.
The amendment modified the Technical Specifications to increase the pressurizer safety valve (PSV) setpoint tolerance
from +/^1 percent to +3 percent and ^1 percent, the main steam safety valve (MSSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent
to +/^3 percent, reducing the high pressurizer pressure trip setpoint (HPPT) response time from 1.15 seconds to 0.5
second, and reducing the TS minimum auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump flow requirement from 750 gallons per minute (GPM)
to 650 GPM.
The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1990 (55 FR 53220). A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice. By Memorandum and Order dated May, 9, 1991 (LBP&hyph;91&hyph;19), a petition for leave to intervene and a
request for hearing filed by the intervenors was granted. However, the intervenors later withdrew that challenge.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station
located in St. Francisville, Louisiana.

The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) by removing component lists from the TSs
in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;08 and by removing the schedule for withdrawal of reactor vessel
material specimen capsules from the TSs in accordance with GL 91&hyph;01.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change will not result in any hardware or operating changes. The proposed change is based upon Generic
Letters 91&hyph;01 and 91&hyph;08 and merely removes component lists, removes details relating to the component
lists, provides clarifying information supporting the removal of the component listings, or removes details (which
are considered administrative) that are no longer applicable to the Technical Specifications. The components listed
in the affected Technical Specifications are assumed in the mitigation of accident and transient events. The removal
of tabular component listings from the Technical Specifications does not impact affected component OPERABILITY
requirements. Technical Specifications will continue to require the components to be OPERABLE. Action statements
and surveillance requirements for the components will also remain in the Technical Specifications. The tabular
component lists are relocated to the Technical Requirements Manual which will be in accordance with the change control
provisions specified in the Administrative Controls Section of the Technical Specifications (Specification 6.5.2).
Therefore, this change is administrative in nature and does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment
will be installed) or changes to parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will not impose
any different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. No new failure modes are introduced.
Therefore, this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis assumption. The
proposed changes do not alter the scope of equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to surveillance
testing, nor do the proposed changes affect any instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. Therefore the
change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involved no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By June 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Government Documents Department, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.


As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William D. Beckner, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;1: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mark J. Wetterhahn, Esq., Winston &amp; Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005,
attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i) through (v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated January 14, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Government Documents Department, Louisiana
State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803.

jurisdiction. Pursuant to 150.20(b)(1), before engaging in such use, Agreement State licensees are required to
notify the NRC of their intent to conduct activities in non-Agreement States under the terms of the general license
granted by 10 CFR 150.20(a). They are required to file four copies of NRC Form&hyph;241 and copies of their Agreement
State license with the Regional Administrator of the NRC Regional Office for the NRC Region in which the Agreement
State that issued the license is located.



II



In January 1990 the NRC issued a Notice of Violation to the Licensee for failing to follow the requirements of 10 CFR
150.20(b). As a result of an investigation in April 1992, the NRC issued an Order Suspending General License (Effective
Immediately) on May 18, 1992, for deliberate, repeat violations of the same provision. The Order suspends the Licensee's
authority to conduct activities in non-Agreement States until the Order is relaxed or rescinded.



III



In a letter of December 30, 1993, the Licensee requested permission to resume activities in non-Agreement States.
On February 15, 1994, a transcribed meeting with the Licensee's president and owner was conducted in NRC's Region
IV offices in Arlington, Texas. In that meeting, the president and owner expressed his recognition of the importance
of proper training, an emphasis on safety, and compliance with all regulatory requirements, including filing NRC
Form 241 when required. In addition, the Licensee indicated his willingness to comply with additional certification
and advance notice requirements that the NRC might impose as a condition for being allowed to resume NRC licensed activities
in non-Agreement States.

The staff believes that the Licensee has recognized the importance of compliance with regulatory requirements and
if allowed to resume NRC licensed activities in non-Agreement States with additional certification and notification
requirements, the Licensee will comply with all regulatory requirements, and that the May 18, 1992 Order Suspending
General License (Effective Immediately) should be rescinded, subject to certain requirements. These requirements
include certification as to training and knowledge of subpart B of 10 CFR part 34 of all employees engaged in radiographic
operations and advance notice to the NRC of NRC licensed activities to be conducted in non-Agreement States. Implementation
of these requirements would provide enhanced assurance that radiographic operations will be conducted safely and
in compliance with requirements.

I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth above are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these
commitments the public health and safety are reasonably assured, and should be confirmed by this Order. The Licensee
has agreed to the terms and issuance of this Confirmatory Order in a telephone call on May 6, 1994, between Mr. William
Fisher of the NRC and Mr. Orvil Couch, president and owner, Panhandle N.D.T. &amp; Inspection, Inc.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, and 10 CFR part 150, It Is Hereby Ordered, That Panhandle N.D.T. &amp;
Inspection, Inc.'s Authority To Conduct NRC-Licensed Activities In Non-Agreement States Under The General License
Granted By 10 CFR 150.20(a) Is Modified As Follows: 

1. The Order dated May 18, 1992 is rescinded;

2. When the Licensee next files an NRC Form 241, in addition to complying with all requirements of 10 CFR 150.20(b),
the Licensee shall also certify, under oath or affirmation, that:
a. It has a training plan in place concerning the requirements of subpart B of 10 CFR part 34;
b. It has trained all present employees engaged in radiography operations, and will train all such future employees,
in the requirements of subpart B of 10 CFR part 34; and
c. All current employees engaged in radiography operations have read, and future employees will read, and understand
subpart B of 10 CFR part 34; and
3. For a period of three years from the date of this Order, in addition to complying with the requirement in 10 CFR 150.20(b)(1),
the Licensee shall notify NRC Region IV, by 9 a.m. (Central Time) Monday (or Tuesday, if Monday is a federal holiday)
of each week that radiography is planned in non-Agreement States, of the field sites where radiography is planned
that week, as well as the specific date and time that the radiography is planned. If unplanned work arises after the
Monday notification, the new work cannot be done in a non-Agreement State unless the NRC has been provided 24 hours
notice. Notification shall be made to William L. Fisher, Chief, Nuclear Materials Licensing Branch, or his designated
representative, at (817) 860&hyph;8215.
The Regional Administrator, Region IV, may relax or rescind, in writing, any of the above conditions upon a showing
by the Licensee of good cause.

<DOCTITLE>Richardson X-Ray, Inc., Rancho Dominerey, California, Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties</DOCTITLE>


I


Richardson X-Ray, Inc. (Licensee or Richardson) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 0373&hyph;70 issued
by the State of California. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess and use sealed sources in industrial radiographic
exposure devices within the State of California. Pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20 and Richardson's California license,
Richardson is authorized to possess and use licensed byproduct materials to perform industrial radiography in Non-Agreement
States and areas under exclusive Federal jurisdiction.



II


An inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was conducted on July 29 and 30, 1993, of the Licensee's activities
that were performed in an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction at Vandenburg Air Force Base, California. The results
of the inspection determined that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements.
A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by
letter dated November 5, 1993. The Notice states the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements
that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalties proposed for the violations. The Licensee responded
to the Notice in a letter dated November 30, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted the violations assessed civil
penalties, but requested that the proposed civil penalties be remitted based on its corrective actions and its alleged
inability to pay the proposed $25,000 civil penalty.



III



After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for remission
contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the Licensee's timely
and extensive corrective actions support a $5,000 reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November
5, 1993 Notice, based on mitigation consistent with the Enforcement Policy.



IV


In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282,
and 10 CFR 2.205, it is hereby ordered that:
The Licensee pay civil penalties in the full amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) by check, draft, or money
order, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, USNRC, Washington,
DC 20555. This payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order or in accordance with the attached
Promissory Note for Payment of the Civil Penalties (Note). If payment is to be in accordance with the attached Note,
the Licensee within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order shall submit the signed Note in duplicate to the Director,
Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Mail stop 7H5, Washington, DC 20555.



V


The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for a hearing should be clearly
marked as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent
to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator,
NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the Licensee
fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without
further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for
collection.
In the event the Licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether,
on the basis of the violations admitted by the Licensee, this Order should be sustained.

Appendix_Evaluation and Conclusion



On November 5, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was issued to Richardson
X-Ray, Inc. (Licensee) for violations identified during an NRC inspection conducted on July 29 and 30, 1993. The Licensee
responded to the Notice in a letter, dated November 30, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted the violations
but requested remission of the penalties, based on its corrective actions and its alleged inability to pay. The NRC's
evaluations and conclusion regarding the Licensee's requests are as follows:



Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation



The Licensee admitted the violations, but requested remission of the proposed civil penalties, in whole or in part,
on the following bases:

1. In response to earlier violations of state radiography requirements, the State of California had required the
Licensee to obtain the services of a consultant to provide radiation safety training and perform unannounced job
site surveys of each radiographer. The cost of hiring the consultant was $10,000.

2. Corrective actions taken by the Licensee after the Enforcement Conference included appointing a new RSO and terminating
the prior RSO, and implementing a disciplinary policy for radiographic personnel.

3. The imposition of the civil penalties would cause a financial burden on the licensee to the point of possible forfeiture
of its radioactive materials license.



NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request for Mitigation



The NRC has evaluated the Licensee's response and has determined that an adequate basis was not provided for full remission
or reduction of the civil penalties, however mitigation of the civil penalties is warranted based on the Licensee's
corrective actions is warranted. In particular:

1. Earlier inspections by the NRC and the State of California had identified similar violations by Licensee personnel
during the two years preceding the July 1993 NRC inspection. For example, in December 1991 Licensee was cited by the
State of California for: (1) Failure to perform surveys of the radiographic exposure device, (2) failure to recharge
a pocket dosimeter at the beginning of the shift, and (3) failure to perform quarterly audits of radiographic personnel.

In April 1992, the Licensee was cited by the State of California for: (1) Failure to wear personal monitoring devices,
(2) failure to perform surveys of the radiographic exposure device, (3) failure to post the restricted area and high
radiation area, (4) failure to maintain surveillance of the restricted area to prevent unauthorized access into
the high radiation area, (5) failure to maintain records of surveys, source usage, and training, and (6) failure to
perform quarterly audits of radiographic personnel.

In May 1992, the State of California held an Enforcement Conference with the Licensee to discuss the violations identified
during the April 1992 inspection. As a result of the Enforcement Conference the Licensee was required to hire a consultant
to perform radiation safety training and audits of radiographic personnel. The Licensee's hiring of a consultant
in May 1992 did not prevent recurrence of the same types of violations in July 1993.

Costs incurred by licensees to ensure compliance and implementation of their radiation safety programs are not considered
in determining the base civil penalty, nor in escalating or mitigating the civil penalty.

2. The Licensee cites additional corrective actions in its response that include appointing a new RSO, terminating
the prior RSO and implementing a disciplinary policy for radiographic personnel. The NRC recognizes that the Licensee
took immediate corrective actions following the inspector's identification of the violations which included retraining
of all radiographers and assistant radiographers, monitoring with regular unannounced job site audits, ensuring
radiographers have the needed equipment prior to leaving for the job and ensuring that the radiographers are trained
on all equipment.

The November 5, 1993, Notice stated that based on the repetitiveness of the violations, the Licensee's 1992 corrective
actions were inadequate and that additional corrective actions needed to be considered to prevent further repetition.
Given that the Licensee's more recent corrective actions were timely and extensive, these actions support a $5,000
reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November 5, 1993 Notice, based on mitigation consistent
with the Enforcement Policy.

3. Based on its review of the financial information provided by the Licensee, the NRC determined that the Licensee
possesses sufficient financial resources to pay the proposed civil penalties over a period of time, including interest.
Accordingly, a payment schedule has been developed and is enclosed in the form of a Promissory Note in Payment of the
Civil Penalties (Note). The Licensee, however, may pay the civil penalties in full, if it so desires.

In view of the above, the proposed civil penalties should not be reduced based on the Licensee's alleged inability
to pay.



NRC Conclusion



Based on its evaluation of the Licensee's response, the NRC concludes that the Licensee's timely and extensive corrective
actions support a $5,000 reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November 5, 1993 Notice.

Notice, based on mitigation consistent with the Enforcement Policy. Accordingly, civil monetary penalties in the
amount of $20,000 should be imposed.

<USBUREAU>Office of Federal Procurement Policy</USBUREAU>


Performance-Based Contracting for Services



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

OFPP is requesting comments and suggestions with regard to the establishment of a pilot program to increase the use
of performance-based contracting methods in the acquisition of services.







BACKGROUND: 

A major contract reform initiative of OFPP is to reform the manner by which the government contracts for services by
introducing performance-based contracting methods. Performance-based contracting means structuring all aspects
of an acquisition around the purpose of the work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work is
to be performed or the use of broad and imprecise statements of work.



Numerous internal agency evaluations and investigations, General Accounting Office Reports, and congressional
hearings have documented significant and systemic service contracting problems (i.e., cost overruns, performance
delays, and performance problems). To correct these problems, OFPP published Policy Letter 91&hyph;2, Service
Contracting (

Federal Register

 Vol. 56, No. 72, p. 15113) on April 15, 1991, which requires the use of performance-based contracting to the maximum
extent practicable when acquiring services. This approach provides the means to ensure that the appropriate quality
level of performance is achieved, and that payment is made only for services that meet contract standards.

Performance-based contracting methods include: statements of work comprised of objective, measurable performance
standards; quality assurance surveillance plans and objective positive and negative incentives based on the statement
of work criteria; selection procedures which include publishing draft solicitations for comment and requiring
quality-related evaluation factors, including cost realism and past performance; and conversion from cost reimbursement
to fixed price contracts.

To stimulate the government's conversion to performance-based service contracting, OFPP has developed a government-wide
pilot project which relies on voluntary pledges by individual agencies to convert specified contracts for services
to performance-based contracting methods. Agencies will be encouraged to limit their pledged contracts to recurring
requirements to facilitate before and after measurement and assessment of results. Agencies will also be asked to
consider breaking up large level-of-effort umbrella contracts in order to increase competition and convert to completion-type
contracts where possible, thereby generating more innovation and cost effective proposals.

Agency pledges are also expected to include: Endorsement of the project by the agency head; establishment of a high-level
agency task force to oversee the effort; agreement to share lessons learned and best practices with other agencies;
and measurement of the results of the project using predetermined project measurement criteria. The proposed project
measurement criteria are: contract price; level of competition; number of contract audits; customer (project officer)
satisfaction; length of procurement cycle; and small business participation.

OFPP recognizes that performance-based service contracting will require cultural change and, therefore, must
rely on the support and good faith efforts of both the agencies and the contracting community to be successful. Thus,
to help ensure the success of this pilot project, OFPP will also ask contractors for their cooperation. Working with
associations representing large numbers of service providers, OFPP is considering asking potential contractors
to: endorse this project; assist OFPP in identifying requirements that are typically acquired on a cost reimbursement
basis for the government but on a fixed price basis for commercial clients; identify obstacles in government service
contracting that need to be overcome to implement performance-based contracting methods and/or preferred commercial
contracting practices; and voluntarily refrain from bid protests and disputes related to procurements contained
in the agency pledges.




PUBLIC MEETING:

 A public meeting will be held in the White House Conference Center, Eisenhower Room, 726 Jackson Place, Washington,
DC 20503 at 2 p.m. on Thursday, June 16, 1994. Persons or organizations wishing to present ideas or suggestions about
the pilot program or other specific actions that OFPP and other government agencies can take to increase the use of
performance-based service contracting are encouraged to attend the meeting. Persons and organizations wishing

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Listing and Trading of Indexed Term Notes



May 17, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 13, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
On May 16, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change to alter the eligibility standards for Index
(as defined herein) components as originally proposed. As amended, non-U.S. component securities (stocks or American
Depositary Receipts) that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance agreements may not in the aggregate represent
more than two components of the Index. See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative
Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market
Regulation, Commission, dated May 16, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The Exchange proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''),
Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based in whole or in part on changes in the value of a static portfolio
of ten equity securities. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex,
and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Under section 107 of the Guide, the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily
categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Amex now proposes to list for trading under section 107
A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part on a static index composed of ten actively-traded equity
securities to be determined and published by Lehman Brothers on or about July 1, 1994 (``Index''). The securities
to be included in the Index will be announced by Lehman Brothers at or as close as possible to the time of the offering
of the Notes.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27753 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8626 (March 8, 1990).



</FOOTNOTE>


The Notes will be non-convertible debt securities and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of
the Guide. Specifically, the Notes must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2)
a minimum of 400 holders; (3) an aggregate market value of at least $20 million; and (4) a term of at least one year. Additionally,
the issuer of the Notes (

i.e.

, Lehman Brothers) must have assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax
income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>





<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
3

</FOOTNAME>
As an alternative to these financial criteria, the issuer may have either: (1) Assets in excess of $200 million and
stockholders' equity in excess of $10 million; or (2) assets in excess of $100 million and stockholders' equity in
excess of $20 million.

</FOOTNOTE>


Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the
Notes will provide for maturity within approximately one year from the date of issue. Notes may provide for periodic
payments and/or payments at maturity based in whole or in part on changes in the value of the Index. In addition, the
Notes may feature a ``cap'' on the maximum amount and/or a ``floor'' on the minimum amount to be paid either periodically
or at maturity. Prior to the commencement of listing and trading of the Notes, the Exchange shall distribute a circular
to its membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities, including appropriate
suitability criteria and/or guidelines.


The ten components of the Index shall meet the following criteria: (1) A minimum market capitalization of $75 million,
except that one component security may have a market capitalization of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume
in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than one million shares, except that one component
security may have a trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than 500,000
shares; (3) at least nine of the ten components of the Index will meet the then current criteria for standardized options
trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components of the Index will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock
Exchange, or will be National Market securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System; and (5) no more than two components of the Index shall be non-U.S. securities that are not subject
to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the appropriate regulatory organizations.


The Index will be calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the
component securities is represented in an approximately equal dollar amount in the Index. To create the Index, a portfolio
of ten equity securities will be established by the issuer, Lehman Brothers, representing an investment of $10,000
in each component security (rounded to the nearest whole share). The value of the Index will equal the current market
value of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the component securities divided by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor will initially be set to provide a benchmark value of 100.00 at the close of trading on the day preceding
the establishment of the Index.


The number of shares of each component stock in the Index will remain fixed except in the event of certain types of corporate
actions such as the payment of a dividend (other than an ordinary cash dividend), a stock distribution, stock split,
reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, or similar event with
respect to the component securities. The number of shares of each component security may also be adjusted, if necessary,
in the event of a merger, consolidation, dissolution, or liquidation of an issuer or in certain other events such as
the distribution of property by an issuer to shareholders, the expropriation or nationalization of a foreign issuer
of the imposition of certain foreign taxes on shareholders of a foreign issuer. Shares of a component security may
be replaced (or supplemented) with other securities under certain circumstances, such as the conversion of a component
stock into another class of security, the termination of a depositary receipt program, or the spin-off of a subsidiary.
If the security remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share,
to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately prior to the corporate action. In
all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure continuity of the value of the Index.

<DOCNO> FR940523-2-00114 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The value of the Index will be calculated continuously by the Amex and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated
Tape Association's Network B.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:



(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;16
and should be submitted by June 13, 1994.

On May 3, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), submitted an application for unlisted trading privileges
(``UTP'') pursuant to section 12(f)(1)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') in the following over-the-counter
(``OTC'') securities, 

i.e., 

securities not registered under Section 12(b) of the Act.

this application. Persons desiring to make written comments should file three copies with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

Commentators are asked to address whether they believe the requested grant of UTP as well as the withdrawal of UTP would
be consistent with Section 12(f)(2), which requires that, in considering an application for extension or withdrawal
of UTP in an OTC security, the Commission consider, among other matters, the public trading activity in such security,
the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such security, and the desirability
of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system.

<DOCTITLE>Request for Comment on Articles To Be Considered for Accelerated Tariff Elimination Under the North American Free-Trade

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of and request for comments on articles under consideration for negotiation with the Governments of Mexico
and Canada for accelerated elimination of preferential NAFTA tariffs.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 201(b) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (``the Act'') grants the President,
subject to the consultation and lay-over requirements of section 103(a) of the Act, the authority to proclaim any
accelerated schedule for duty elimination that may be agreed to by the United States, Mexico and Canada under Article
302(3) of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``the NAFTA''). This notice is intended to inform the public of
those articles on which the United States Government and the Governments of Mexico and Canada have agreed to consider
accelerated elimination of duties under the NAFTA. Inclusion on this list does not signify that the parties have agreed
to accelerate elimination of its duty, only that the parties will consider doing so.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Copies of a listing of specific products to be considered for accelerated tariff elimination, where the subheading
is listed in Annex I with an asterisk, may be obtained from the following agencies:

Proposed Items To Receive Accelerated Duty Elimination


Articles in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that are proposed for accelerated duty elimination
are listed in Annex I to this notice. Lists of articles in the Mexican Tariff Schedule of the General Import Duty Act
and the Customs Tariff of Canada that are proposed for accelerated duty elimination are listed in Annexes II and III,
respectively. Inclusion on this list does not signify that the parties have agreed to accelerate elimination of its
duty, only that the parties will consider doing so. Comments of the public on the advisability of an acceleration will
be taken into account in determining the U.S. position with respect to each product under consideration. Petitions
received by January 25, 1994, in accordance with the 

Federal Register

 of December 23, 1993, but not listed in this notice, shall be considered during the next round of tariff acceleration
discussions with Mexico and Canada.


Advice of the United States International Trade Commission


The United States International Trade Commission is being furnished with the list of articles published in Annex
I of this notice for the purpose of securing from the Commission its judgement as to the probable economic effect of
accelerated elimination of U.S. duties under the NAFTA on industries producing like or directly competitive articles
and on consumers.


Advice of the Private Sector Advisory Committee


Pursuant to section 103(a) of the Act, private sector advisory committees are being furnished with the list of articles
published in the Annexes of this notice for their advice.


Articles That May Be Considered in Negotiations


Please read this section carefully. Except as noted, all articles provided for in the subheadings of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States that are listed in the Annexes to this notice are being considered for accelerated
duty elimination. A description of articles provided for in these subheadings is available for Annex I in the ``Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (1994), Supplement 1,'' U.S. International Trade Commission Publication 2690.
The ``Customs Tariff'' of Canada and the Mexican ``Tarifa de la Ley del Impuesto General de Importaci&oacute;'' (Tariff
Schedule of the ``General Import Duty Act'') should be consulted for a description of the articles provided for in
the tariff subheadings in Annex II and III.
For subheadings listed in the Annexes with an asterisk, only certain products will be considered for accelerated
tariff elimination. A list of the specific products which will be considered is available (see 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

 above).
As with the NAFTA itself, the tariff acceleration exercise will result in three separate bilateral agreements between
the United States and Mexico, the United States and Canada, and Canada and Mexico. Thus, in some cases, acceleration
is not being considered among all three parties, as indicated in the Annexes, and a subsequent agreement to accelerate
may not include all countries indicated in the Annexes. As a rule, accelerated duty elimination is being considered
on a reciprocal basis on the equivalent tariff subheadings by the parties involved. In many cases, however, one or
two parties may already provide NAFTA duty-free treatment to one or both of the other parties. In such cases, the Annexes
do not list products already eligible for NAFTA duty-free treatment. A concordance showing the equivalent items
in all three tariff schedules, including those already duty-free, is available (see 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

 above).

<RINDOCK>[Ref. Docket 43232] </RINDOCK>


Office of the Secretary

Prohibition on the Sale of Passenger Air Transportation to Lebanon 


Notice reaffirming the restriction prohibiting the sale, in the United States, of passenger air transportation
to Lebanon. We are publishing this notice in its entirety as an appendix to this document. 







<DATE>
DATE:

 Issued in Washington, DC, May 17, 1994.

Patrick V. Murphy,

and International Affairs.



 



Notice 



As a result of foreign air carriers adding service to Beirut, Lebanon, over the past few years, the Department has increased
its monitoring activities relating to the air transportation restrictions put in place with regard to Lebanon in
1985. This has led to the issuance of a number of consent cease and desist orders and the assessment of substantial civil
penalties for violations of these restrictions. Investigations of possible violations by a number of other airlines
and travel agents are continuing. 

By this Notice, we once again take the opportunity to reaffirm the restrictions that were put in place as a result of
security concerns by Department Order 85&hyph;7&hyph;45, as modified by Order 92&hyph;8&hyph;25. Specifically,
it is a condition of all certificates held by U.S. air carriers, all permits held by foreign air carriers and all exemptions
from sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act that the holder shall not sell in the United States any passenger
transportation by air which includes any type of stop in Lebanon. The Department has consistently interpreted this
restriction to apply to all sales activities in the United States by air carriers and their agents, including travel
agents, consolidators, wholesalers and other third parties, that are utilized to transact such sales. This prohibition
includes any activity undertaken in the United States that effectuates the sale of such air transportation and includes,
but is not limited to, reservations made in the United States by any air carrier or its agents by mail, overnight express,
courier, telephone, facsimile or other means to any air carrier or its agents, including travel agents, consolidators,
wholesalers and other third parties, located outside the United States that results in the issuance of a passenger
ticket or the confirmation of a reservation for passenger air transportation to Lebanon. 

The fact that a ticket for air transportation is issued outside the U.S. is not dispositive of whether the sale of that
ticket was made in the U.S. Thus, for example, a travel agent receiving reimbursement in the U.S. for a passenger ticket
for air transportation service to Lebanon, who obtains that ticket through an airline or consolidator in Canada,
would be in violation of the Department's Lebanon restrictions. Likewise, an airline that accepts a U.S. telephone
purchase in Canada for air transportation to Lebanon, with ticket delivery in the U.S., would also violate our Lebanon
restrictions. These agents and airlines would be subject to the imposition of substantial civil penalties. Moreover,
criminal prosecution could result from knowing and willful violations of the law. 

This Notice shall be published in the 

Federal Register

 and shall be served on all certificated air carriers, all foreign air carriers, the United States Departments of State
and Justice, the Air Transport Association, the International Air Transport Association, the National Air Carrier
Association, the American Society of Travel Agents, and the Association of Retail Travel Agents.

Falls and North Kingston, Rhode Island. The proposed improvement would involve the construction of a new third track
parallel to the NEC mainline along the entire corridor for a distance of about 35 kilometers (22 miles).




Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to alleviate impacts to freight rail service resulting from
the proposed Amtrak Northeast Corridor electrification project. Construction of electrification facilities
and associated changes in intercity passenger operations are expected to reduce vertical and horizontal clearances
at overhead bridges along the corridor, limit daytime freight movements to existing levels, and restrict additional
freight movements to nighttime hours. Alternatives under consideration include (1) Taking no action; (2) construction
of a continuous third track parallel to the NEC mainline including ancillary modifications to overhead bridge structures;
and (3) other reasonable alternatives identified during the scoping process.

Public scoping meeting(s) will be held in Cranston, RI between June and July 1994. In addition, a public hearing will
be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearing. The draft EIS will be available
for public and agency review prior to the public hearing.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to FHWA at the address provided above.

<RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;67; Notice 2] </RINDOCK>


Sekurit Glas Union GmbH; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance 



Sekurit-Glas Union GmbH (hereinafter referred to as ``Sekurit''), a division of VEGLA GmbH, of Aachen, Germany,
determined that it manufactured glazing which was installed in buses imported to the United States of America (USA)
which does not comply with the marking requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing
Materials'' (49 CFR 571.205), and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573. 
As a result of these findings, Sekurit also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements
of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that the noncompliance is
inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. 
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51126) and an opportunity afforded for
comment. 
Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, American National Standard Institute's ``Safety Code for Safety
Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z-26.1&hyph;1977, January 26, 1977,
as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that, with certain exceptions, glazing materials
for use in motor vehicles shall conform with Paragraphs S5, ``Requirements,'' S6, ``Certification and Marking,''
and ANS Z26.1.6, ``Marking of Safety Glazing Materials.'' Accordingly, all safety glazing materials shall be legibly
and permanently marked in letters and numerals, at least 0.070 inch (l.78mm) in height, with the words ``American
National Standard'' or the characters AS, and, adjacent to those characters, the numeral that identifies the type
of construction of the glazing materials. 
Sekurit's noncompliant glazings were mounted in front doors of buses manufactured by Karl K&auml;ssbohrer GmbH,
a customer of Sekurit, and exported to the USA. These door glazings were erroneously marked AS3, instead of AS2. This
type of glazing has a regular light transmittance over 70 percent, so that its identification as an AS3 item was irrelevant.

The total number (worldwide) of vehicles equipped with mismarked glazings was 6000. The percentage of vehicles in
North America, i.e., where mismarking by USA standards is relevant, was 2.33 percent. That figure is based on 140 vehicles
with a total of 280 mismarked glazings (140 left and 140 right side). 
On March 2, 1992, Sekurit was notified by their customer, K&auml;ssbohrer, that the mismarking had been noticed by
a Department of Transportation inspector in New Jersey at a vehicle approval registration. 
The mismarked glazing is a 17.O mm nominal thickness, class 1, multiple glazed unit consisting of one sheet of ``AS2'',
M&hyph;320'' clear tempered float safety glass and one sheet of ``AS2, M&hyph;24100'' green tinted tempered float
safety glass with an AirGap of 6.0&hyph;12.0 mm, SEKURIT SAINT-GOBAIN, ``DOT&hyph;27, AS3, M&hyph;4412.'' According
to the petitioner, this glazing can be used anywhere in a motor vehicle except the windshield. 
Sekurit supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance by stating that the item in question should be
marked_and has been so since March 1993_AS2 and not AS3, as it complies with requirements of Test 1, ``Light Stability,''
and Test 2, ``Luminous Transmittance'' of ANS Z26.1&hyph;1983, as it shows values of light transmission over 70 percent.
Double glazings of class 1 complying with these requirements may be mounted anywhere in a vehicle except windshields.
Sekurit further stated that by mismarking AS2 glazings as AS3 they prejudiced the use of the mismarked glazings by
indicating a restriction in permitted locations that was irrelevant. The DOT&hyph;27 M4412 complies in all ways
except the mark ``AS3,'' with safety requirements requisite at locations such as front door windows of buses. 
Several measures have been taken by Sekurit to remedy the error of mismarked glazings:



_Applied for revision of ETL Report 

#

495331 of December 11, 1989 to have the correct test reference and marking included. Revised May 12, 1993; 
ETL was asked as an official laboratory to perform another series of tests on samples of a recent production campaign,
in order to check the continuous conformity of the product to AS2 requirements. ETL test report 

#

529002 of May 19, 1993 verifies this. 

_Revisions from ETL Report 

#

495331 were registered at American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), who consequently adjusted
their Notice 

#

900342/930515. 
_Customer was supplied with two glazings (1 left side and 1 right side) with correct marking for immediate check, comparison
and replacement. 
_Prepared and introduced correct marking 

_Checked light transmission in our [Sekurit] internal laboratory 

_Informed the European authorities; received final statement of inconsequential mismarking on May 10, 1993 



Sekurit believes that mismarking of AS2 glazings with AS3 designation is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety and therefore petitioned for exemption from the notification and remedial portions of the Act. 
No comments were received on the petition. 
NHTSA is satisfied that the performance requirements for AS2 glazing are met by the misidentified materials. However,
there are considerations that go beyond compliance with performance requirements. NHTSA recalls Docket IP80&hyph;3
in which Volkswagen omitted to mark certain windshields with the required AS1 designation. Two comments were received,
both from States, who commented that the lack of marking would result in rejection under their inspection systems.

NHTSA observed that rejection puts the owner the burden of contacting Volkswagen, or of replacing the windshield
before the State would again inspect the vehicle and authorize its continued operation on the roads. NHTSA found that
``[t]he noncompliance has a direct impact upon the vehicle safety inspection process, diverting public resources
with no corresponding safety benefit.'' Accordingly, it denied the petition. 
Although Sekurit's is a case of mismarked side windows rather than an unmarked windshield, the considerations are
similar. Here, the noncompliance was discovered by a State inspector, so that the impact upon the inspection process
is actual rather than theoretical. NHTSA consulted &Kuml;assbohrer of North America and found that it was willing
to provide each of the bus owners with the noncompliant glazing with a letter noting the mismarking and averring as
to its compliance otherwise with Standard No. 205. The letter, dated April 21, 1994, advises the recipient to keep
it in the bus ``in case a DOT inspector notices the incorrect mark.'' This letter should minimize the effect of the noncompliance
upon the State inspection process, and affords a basis upon which NHTSA may grant the petition. 
A further concern of NHTSA was whether, at the time of replacement, AS3 glazing might be installed instead of AS2. This
possibility appears unlikely because local glass shops do not cut multiple glazed units of this type and only factory-made
AS2 windows are used to fill replacement orders. 
For the reasons stated above, it is hereby found that the petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted. (15 U.S.C.
1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Prospective recipient will provide no fewer than ten research fellowships for Russian university teachers to pursue
individual programs in social science fields in U.S. universities and research institutions in the academic year
1995&hyph;1996 in support of strengthened social science curricula in Russian higher education institutions.
Participants should be teaching at the university level in social science fields, including but not limited to, political
science, sociology, economics, law, and demography. Programs will include subject matter exposure, materials
acquisition, scholarly networking, and orientation to current American approaches in these fields, especially
empirical methods. Recipient organization is responsible for publicizing the program abroad, selecting the participants,
placing participants in appropriate U.S. institutions, and for assuring appropriate supervision. Recipient is
also responsible for all administrative arrangements, for program evaluation, and for establishing procedures
for follow-up after participants return to their Russian universities.

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character, and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Academic programs
under the authority of the Bureau must maintain their scholarly integrity and should meet the highest standards of
academic achievement. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including
but not limited to ethnicity, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges.



Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle.



Overview



The program seeks to increase and improve the quality of social science teaching in Russia. The program's immediate
goal is to provide an opportunity for approximately ten qualified Russian university teachers to update and enhance
their knowledge of their social science fields in support of revised and strengthened curricula.


Guidelines



The program is designed for Russian scholars who are teaching at the university level in social science fields including
but not limited to, political science, sociology, economics, law, and demography. In the early stages of the program,
the award recipient is responsible for publicizing the program, recruiting strong applicants and selecting the
most qualified candidates. Participants should be chosen through a public, open competition which includes U.S.
professional peer review for the final selection of participants. Selections should be made and announced in reasonable
time for applicants to make plans for absence from their countries and to undertake departure formalities. USIA,
the Study of U.S. Branch (E/AAS), and USIS Moscow should be informed of the final selection. Proposals should demonstrate
extensive contacts with and knowledge of Russian universities to ensure that the best possible candidates are recruited
and selected.

Award recipient will arrange appropriate placement in U.S. universities and research institutions for participants.
To the extent possible, waivers of tuition fees should be procured.

Fellowships should be six to twelve months in duration. Family members may accompany recipients for part of the grant
period, but grant monies must not be used to support the maintenance of or travel for dependents. The fellowships will
provide for all the costs of the recipients. The dollar amount of the fellowship should be reduced in situations where
Russian university salaries, transferable into U.S. dollars, continue to be received by the fellow while in the United
States.

Award recipient will make all administrative arrangements, including travel, visa, disbursement of grant funds,
insurance and related matters. The recipient should maintain contact with the participants and liaison with university
hosts during the course of the grant to offer assistance with participant academic interests and administrative
concerns such as housing, travel within the U.S., or emergency matters. It is expected that recipient organization
will have substantive contact with university hosts to ensure that participants are able to make maximum use of institutional
resources and facilities. To this end, it may prove useful for the recipient organization to encourage host institutions
to designate specific faculty members to serve as mentors for the Russian participants.

Recipient will develop evaluation instruments and procedures to determine the participants' scholarly activity
during the course of the grant, the adequacy of the stipend, and the adequacy of recipient and university administrative
arrangements. Participants should also report on their general impressions of the U.S. and how they intend to apply
the materials or new information gained during the research in their professional work in their own countries. The
recipient will establish procedures for follow-up communication with grantees to ascertain the application of
their fellowship activity to their professional responsibilities, such as new publications, workshop leadership,
new positions, or new course offerings stemming from their fellowship experience.



Proposed Budget



Applicants must submit a comprehensive line item budget for which specific details are available in the Application
Package. A USIA-funded budget will not exceed $250,000. The recipient organization is expected to provide significant

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY </USDEPT>



Reimbursement for Costs of Remedial Action at Active Uranium and Thorium Processing Sites 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Environmental Management, Department of Energy.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of the acceptance of claims and the availability of funds for reimbursements in fiscal year 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces the Department of Energy's acceptance of initial claims and the availability of approximately
$40.6 million in funds in fiscal year 1994 for reimbursements of certain costs of remedial action at eligible active
uranium and thorium processing sites pursuant to Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Department of Energy
anticipates that claims submitted by licensees in fiscal year 1994 will substantially exceed $40.6 million and would
therefore be subject to prorated payment.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The closing date for the submission of claims for reimbursement in fiscal year 1994 is July 7, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Claims may be mailed to the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, 2155
Louisiana NE., suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM 87110. All claims should be addressed to the attention of Steven Hamp
and sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

 
</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 Steven Hamp, Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, (505) 845&hyph;4628.

 

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy is issuing a final rule under 10 CFR Part 765 published elsewhere in this issue to implement
the requirements of Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (sections 1001&hyph;1004 of Public Law 102&hyph;486,
42 U.S.C. 2296 

et seq

.) and to establish the procedures for eligible licensees to submit claims for reimbursement. Title X requires the
Department of Energy to reimburse eligible uranium and thorium licensees for certain costs of decontamination,
decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action incurred by licensees at active uranium and thorium processing
sites to remediate byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States Government. To be reimbursable,
costs of remedial action must be for work which is necessary to comply with applicable requirements of the Uranium
Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 or, where appropriate, with requirements established by a state pursuant
to a discontinuance agreement under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021). Claims for reimbursement
of costs of remedial action must be supported by reasonable documentation as determined by the Department of Energy
in accordance with 10 CFR part 765. Section 1001(b)(2) of the Act limits the amount of reimbursement to any one licensee
of an active uranium mill tailings site to an amount not to exceed $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the
number of dry short tons of byproduct material located at the site on October 24, 1992, and generated as an incident
of sales to the United States. Total reimbursement, in the aggregate, for work performed at the active uranium sites
shall not exceed $270 million, as adjusted for inflation. Total reimbursement for work performed at the active thorium
processing site shall not exceed $40 million, as adjusted for inflation, and is limited to costs incurred for offsite
disposal. 


Funds for the reimbursements will be provided from the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning
Fund established at the United States Department of Treasury pursuant to section 1801 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954
(42 U.S.C. 2297g). Payment or obligation of funds shall be subject to the requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act
(31 U.S.C. 1341).

 



Authority:

 Section 1001&hyph;1004 of Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776 (42 U.S.C. 2296a 

et seq.

)

 


Issued in Washington, DC, on this 10th day of May, 1994.
