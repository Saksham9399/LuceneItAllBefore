SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 147a, 148, and 450, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the States
and certain other organizations and individuals to control and eradicate plant pests. 
The Asian gypsy moth, which is present in the State of North Carolina, is a destructive pest of plants, especially trees.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture (NCDA),
has initiated a project to eradicate the Asian gypsy moth in North Carolina. 
NCDA, with substantial assistance from USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has prepared
an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate the effects of this eradication project on the environment. Based on
the EA and APHIS' own analysis, the Agency has determined that the eradication project in the State of North Carolina
will not have a significant impact on the environment. APHIS has reviewed and adopted the EA that was prepared by NCDA
with substantial assistance from APHIS. The EA for this cooperative Asian gypsy moth eradication project is supported
by and tiered to the Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects, Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)
as Supplemented, 1985. 
The environmental assessment, finding of no significant impact, and record of decision have been prepared in accordance
with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), 
(2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR
parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).

Rental Housing Loans'' and 10.427, ``Rural Rental Assistance Payments''. 



Discussion of Notice 



7 CFR part 1940, subpart L contains the ``Methodology and Formulas for Allocation of Loan and Grant Program Funds.''
Similar guidance was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 15, 1993 (58 FR 60165), which included a set-aside of funds for this program. This notice provides the public
with further guidance on accessing this set-aside. 



Program Description 



I. Objectives 



A. To encourage applicants of limited gross incomes which have little or no participation in the section 515 Program.


B. To provide housing in unserved areas. 

C. To provide an economic stimulus to the local economy by encouraging procurement of labor, goods, and services from
the local community. 



II. Background 



In accordance with section 506 (b) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, the Secretary is authorized and directed
to conduct research, technical studies, and demonstrations relating to the mission and programs of FmHA and the national
housing goals defined in section 2 of this Act. In connection with such activities, the Secretary shall seek to promote
the construction of adequate farm and other rural housing. The Secretary shall conduct such activities for the purposes
of stimulating construction and improving the architectural design and utility of dwellings and buildings. In furtherance
of this goal, the Rural Rental Housing Diversity Demonstration Program (RRHDDP) is implemented. An appropriate
amount of section 521 new construction rental assistance (RA) is set aside for use with section 515 loan funds. 



III. RRHDDP 



A. 

Amount of Set Aside. 

Set asides for RRHDDP from the current FY allocations are listed at the end of this notice. 

B. 

Selection of States.

all criteria. Seven States were selected and are listed at the end of this notice. 

C. 

State RRHDDP Levels. 

See the list at the end of this notice. 

D. 

Use of Funds. 

To ensure the success of RRHDDP, the State Director may leverage funds from the RRHDDP with allocated funds from the
Section 515 and 521 allocations held in the State Office reserve. The State Director has the discretion to determine
the most effective delivery of RRHDDP funds; however, the intent and scope of the program should be ever present in
the implementation and application processes. 

E. 

National Office RRHDDP Reserve. 

There is no RRHDDP reserve available when the State is unable to fund a request from its regular or RRHDDP allocation.


F. 

Pooling. 

Unused RRHDDP funds and RA will be pooled. Pooling dates and any pertinent information are listed at the end of this
notice. Pooled funds will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to all eligible States. Pooled RRHDDP
funds will remain available until the year-end pooling date. 

IV. 

Eligibility. 

Applicants and proposals will need to meet the following requirements, in addition to those found in 7 CFR part 1944,
subpart E: 

A. The applicant must have had an interest (including family members) in no more than one section 515 loan over the past
3 years. For entity applicants, this restriction applies to all general partners and their family members. For the
purposes of this program, interest means a section 515 loan which has been approved and funds obligated. 

B. The applicant must have had a gross aggregate income from business and personal operations of less than $500,000
in the previous calendar year. For entity applicants, the aggregate income of all general partners will be considered.

V. Processing Preapplications



A. 

Requirements. 

To be eligible for participation in this demonstration program, applicants must ensure that the preapplication
meets all requirements set forth in 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E and this notice. 

1. All complete preapplications must be received in the place designated by the State Director by May 2, 1994. Incomplete
preapplications will not be considered. A complete preapplication consists of all items specified in Exhibit A&hyph;7
of 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E. 

2. Based upon projected demand for the RRHDDP, the State Director will select the manner in which preapplications
will be rated prior to implementation and/or announcement of the program to ensure the public is aware of how requests
will be prioritized. The State Director may elect one of the following systems to prioritize and select proposals
for further processing: 

a. The priority point system contained in &sect;1944.231(d) of 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E; or

B. 

Procurement of labor, goods, and services. 

One of the intents of the RRHDDP is to stimulate the local economy by encouraging procurement of labor, goods, and services
from the local area. FmHA recognizes that defining a local trade area in which to procure the labor, goods, and services
to build an apartment complex is difficult in rural America. To be responsive to the application procedures, applicants
must procure labor, goods, and services from Level One of this paragraph. If labor, goods, and services are not available
in Level One of this paragraph, the applicant may use the trade area defined in Level Two of this paragraph. Documentation
as to why the labor, goods, and services are not available in Level One of this paragraph must be included in the case
file. The applicant may propose to secure labor, goods, and services from Levels Three or Four of this paragraph; however,
documentation as to why same is not available in all of the previous levels must be included in the case file. 

1. 

Level One: 

Labor, goods, and services must be procured within 15 miles of the proposed site of the apartments. 

2. 

Level Two: 

Labor, goods, and services must be procured within the County where the proposed apartments will be located. 

3. 

Level Three: 

Labor, goods, and services must be procured within the lesser of 50 miles from the site of the proposed complex OR the
boundaries of any adjacent County (regardless of State boundary). 

4. 

Level Four: 

Labor, goods, and services must be procured within 100 miles of the proposed site (regardless of State boundary).


C. 

Outreach. 

Outreach efforts publicizing the availability of loan funds for the eligible RRHDDP States will be aggressively
carried out. Each affected State Director will develop an outreach plan which includes such techniques as news releases,
community meetings, coordination with other Federal, State, and local government organizations, to promote full
utilization of these funds by all qualified applicants regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, marital
status, age, and sex. In addition to the above outreach efforts, States with eligible colonias and/or Tribal lands
should establish liaison with community groups in order to leverage support and assistance provided to residents
of colonias and Tribal lands.

D. 

Monitoring performance. 

1. 

National Office: 

The National Office will track the use of targeted funds on a regular basis throughout the FY and take necessary follow-up
actions to facilitate the delivery of the program. 

2. 

State Office: 

The State Director will designate a staff member to coordinate all efforts under RRHDDP. 

E. 

Issuance of Form AD&hyph;622, ``Notice of Preapplication Review Action'', inviting a formal application. 

1. The State Director may issue AD&hyph;622s up to 100 percent of the amount shown at the end of this notice and any funds
made available from the State Office reserve. 

2. All AD&hyph;622s issued for applicants under this demonstration program will be annotated, in Item 7 of the form,
under ``Other Remarks,'' with the following: ``Issuance of this AD&hyph;622 is contingent upon receiving funds
from the Rural Rental Housing Diversity Demonstration Program (RRHDDP).'' Should RRHDDP funds be unavailable or
the program discontinued, this AD&hyph;622 will no longer be valid. In these cases, the request for assistance will
need to compete with other preapplications based upon its priority point score established in accordance with &sect;1944.231
of 7 CFR part 1944, subpart E. 



VI. Exception Authority



The Administrator, or his/her designee, may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirements of this Notice
which are not inconsistent with the authorizing statute, if he/she finds that application of such requirement would
adversely affect the interest of the Government. The Administrator, or his/her designee, may exercise this authority
upon the request of the State Director, Assistant Administrator for Housing, or Director of the Multi-Family Housing
Processing Division (MFHPD). The request must be supported by information that demonstrates the adverse impact
or effect on the program. The Administrator, or his/her designee, also reserves the right to change the pooling date,
establish/change minimum and maximum fund usage from set asides and/or the reserve, or restrict participation in
set asides and/or reserves. 

The following is a list of States selected to participate in the RRHDDP and other pertinent information:

Needs and Uses: 

The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal, demographic, household survey in which
the Census Bureau interviews sample households in waves occurring every 4 months over a 21/2 year period. The survey
is molded around a central ``core'' of labor force and income questions that remain fixed during each wave of a panel.
The core is periodically supplemented with questions designed to answer specific needs. These supplemental questions
are referred to as ``topical modules.'' As part of our transition plans for SIPP from paper to an automated questionnaire,
the Census Bureau is requesting an extension of the 1992 Panel in order to conduct 2 additional waves of interviews.
The topical modules for Wave 9 include the following: 1) Work Schedule, 2) Child Care, 3) Child Support Agreements,
4) Support for Nonhousehold Members, 5) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Adults, 6) Utilization
of Health Care Services&hyph;Adults, 7) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Children, 8) Utilization
of Health Care Services&hyph;Children, and 9) Children's Well&hyph;Being. Wave 9 interviews will be conducted
from October 1994 through January 1995. Wave 10 interviews will have no topical modules and will be conducted from
February 1995 through May 1995.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

Waves 9 and 10 will be conducted once during the panel.

Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 172&hyph;1 (date) Announcing the Standards for
VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.

1. Name of Standard. VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) (FIPS PUB 172&hyph;1).

2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Hardware Description Language.

3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 172 and supersedes that document in its entirety.

This publication announces the adoption of the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for VHDL. This FIPS
adopts American National Standard Hardware Description Language VHDL (ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993) as stipulated
in the Specifications Section. The American National Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation
of programs expressed in VHDL. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of VHDL programs for use on a variety
of data processing systems. The standard is used by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers,
interpreters, analyzers, simulators or other forms of high level language processors, and is used by digital hardware
designers, and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard
and who need to provide specifications for digital hardware descriptions. 

4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.

5. Maintenance Agency. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer
Systems Laboratory (CSL).

6. Cross Index. ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993, IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual.

a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002,
Federal Standards.
b. Federal ADP and Telecommunications Standards Index, U.S. General Services Administration, Information Resources
Management Service, April 1993 (updated periodically).
c. NIST, Validated Products List, NISTIR 5354 (republished quarterly). Available by subscription from the National
Technical Information Service (NTIS).
d. FIPS PUB 29&hyph;2, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 14 September 1987.
8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level digital design information and documentation languages permit
Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the design, production, management, and
maintenance of digital electronic systems. The primary objectives of this Federal hardware description language
standard are:



_To encourage more effective utilization of design personnel by ensuring that design skills acquired under one job
are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer retraining;
_To reduce the cost of design by achieving increased designer productivity and design accuracy through the use of
formal languages;
_To reduce the overall life cycle cost for digital systems by establishing a common documentation language for the
transfer of digital design information across organizational boundaries;
_To protect the immense investment of digital hardware from obsolescence by insuring to the maximal feasible extent
that Federal hardware description language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible
with the installed base.
_To reduce Federal inventory of electronic digital replacement parts.
_To increase the sources of supplies which can satisfy government requirements for mission specific electronic
digital components.



Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.
9. Applicability.
a. Federal standards for hardware description languages are applicable for the design and documentation of digital
systems developed for government use. This standard is suitable for use in the following digital system applications:



_Primary design and documentation of digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components;
_Formal specifications of digital systems throughout the procurement, contracting and development process;
_Test generation for digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components;
_Re-procurement and redesign of digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components.



b. The use of FIPS hardware description languages applies when one or more of the following situations exist:



_When using a formal language for specifying a formal design specification for a complex digital system.




_The digital system is under constant revision during the development process.
_It is desired to have the design understood by multiple groups, or organizations.
_The system under development is to be designed by multiple groups, or organizations.
_Accurate unambiguous specifications are required in the bid and contracting process.



10. Specifications. The specifications for this standard are the language specifications contained in ANSI/IEEE
1076&hyph;1993, IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual.
This FIPS does not allow conforming implementations to extend the language. A conforming implementation is one that
does not allow inclusion of substitute or additional language elements in order to accomplish a feature of the language
as specified in the language standard. A conforming implementation is one which adheres to and implements all of the
language specifications contained in ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993 except where the language standard permits deviations
and which specifies conspicuously in a separate section in the conforming implementation documentation all such
permitted variations. Also, such conformance shall be with default language processor system option settings.
The ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993 document does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results
when the rules of the standard fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control programs, or
the means of transforming programs for processing.

11. Implementation. The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of
VHDL processors, interpretation of FIPS VHDL, and validation of VHDL processors. 

11.1. Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective three (3) months after the publication in the 

Federal Register

 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Prior to that date the requirements of FIPS PUB 172 apply to Federal
VHDL procurements. This delayed effective date is intended to provide sufficient time for implementors of FIPS PUB
172 to make enhancements necessary for conformance of products to FIPS PUB 172&hyph;1. No further transitional period
is necessary. 

11.2. Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS VHDL should be considered whether VHDL processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for hardware description services. Recommended terminology for
procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications
Standards Index, chapter 4 part 1. 

11.3. Interpretation of FIPS VHDL. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions regarding the specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All
questions about the interpretation of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory,
ATTN: FIPS VHDL Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice:
301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, FAX: 301&hyph;948&hyph;6213.

11.4. Validation of VHDL Processors: The validation of VHDL processors for conformance to this standard applies
when NIST VHDL validation procedures are available. At the present time NIST does not have procedures for validating
VHDL processors. NIST is currently investigating methods which may be considered for validating processors for
conformance to this standard. 

For further information contact: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS VHDL Validation, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (301) 975&hyph;2490. 

12. Waivers.

Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or 

b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings. 

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, room
B&hyph;154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.


A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part
of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency. 

13.&blank;Where to Obtain Copies. Copies of this publication are for sale by the National Technical Information
Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, Springfield, VA 22161, telephone (703) 487&hyph;4650. (Sale of the included

<DOCTITLE>Termination of Selected National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Services</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice to terminate specific programs within the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under the NVLAP Procedures (15 CFR part 7), the Director of NIST may terminate a field of testing or a LAP when the Director
NIST determines that a need no longer exists to accredit laboratories for the services covered under the scope of a
LAP.




The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requests comments on proposed termination of selected
fields of testing in the Computer/Electronics and Product Testing Laboratory Accreditation Programs offered by
NVLAP, and announces a 60 day comment period for that purpose. The fields of testing proposed for termination are High
Level Protocols, DDN X.25/Blacker Host, Plastics, Seals and Sealants, and Solid Fuel Room Heaters.


A review of all NVLAP programs revealed that these particular fields of testing had very small and/or declining laboratory
enrollments which makes their continuance impractical. NVLAP operates solely on a fee reimbursable basis and it

<DOCTITLE>Commission Agendas and Priorities; Public Hearing</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Consumer Product Safety Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public hearing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission will conduct a public hearing to receive views from all interested parties about its agenda and priorities
for Commission attention during fiscal year 1996, which begins October 1, 1995. Participation by members of the public
is invited. Written comments and oral presentations concerning the Commission's agenda and priorities for fiscal
year 1996 will become part of the public record.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. on May 12, 1994. Written comments will be accepted until May 5, 1994. Requests from
members of the public desiring to make oral presentations must be received by the Office of the Secretary not later
than April 28, 1994. Persons desiring to make oral presentations at this hearing must submit a written text of their
presentations not later than May 5, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

The hearing will be in room 420 of the East-West Towers Building, 4330 East West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland. Written
comments, requests to make oral presentations, and texts of oral presentations should be captioned ``Agenda and

or delivered to that office, room 502, 4330 East West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland.


</ADDRESS>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:


For information about the hearing or to request an opportunity to make an oral presentation, call or write Sheldon
Butts, Deputy Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800;
telefax (301) 504&hyph;0127.


</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 4(j) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2053(j)) requires the Commission to establish an
agenda for action under the laws it administers, and priorities for action at least 30 days before the beginning of
each fiscal year. Section 4(j) of the CPSA provides further that before establishing its agenda and priorities for
action, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing and provide an opportunity for the submission of comments.


Selection of priorities from the Commission's agenda of projects and programs is a crucial step in the development
of the Commission's budget for each fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget requires all Federal agencies
to submit their budget requests 13 months before the beginning of each fiscal year. The Commission is beginning the
process of formulating its budget request for fiscal year 1996, which begins on October 1, 1995.
For this reason, the Commission will conduct a public hearing on May 12, 1994, to receive comments from the public concerning
its agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996. The Commissioners desire to obtain the views of a wide range of interested
persons including consumers; manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers of consumer products; members
of the academic community; consumer advocates; and health and safety officers of state and local governments.
The Commission is charged by Congress with protection of the public from unreasonable risks of injury associated
with consumer products. The Commission enforces and administers the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051


et seq.

); the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 

et seq.

); the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 

et seq.

); the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471 

et seq.

); and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211 

et seq.

). Standards and regulations issued under provisions of those statutes are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations,
title 16, chapter II.
While the Commission has broad jurisdiction over products used by consumers in or around their homes, in schools,
in recreation, and other settings, its staff and budget are limited. Section 4(j) of the CPSA expresses Congressional
direction to the Commission to establish an agenda for action each fiscal year and to select from that agenda a limited
number of projects for priority attention.
Commission priorities are selected in accordance with the Commission statement of policy governing establishment
of priorities codified at 16 CFR 1009.8. That policy statement includes the following factors to be considered by
the Commission when selecting its priorities:
&bull;Frequency and severity of injuries.
&bull;Causality of injuries.
&bull;Chronic illness and future injuries.
&bull;Costs and benefits of Commission action.
&bull;Unforeseen nature of a risk of injury.
&bull;Vulnerability of the population at risk.
&bull;Probability of exposure to hazard.
The order of listing of these criteria does not indicate their relative importance. The Commission will consider
these criteria to the extent feasible and as interactively as possible when evaluating each candidate project in
the selection of its priorities for fiscal year 1996.
Persons who desire to make oral presentations at the hearing on May 12, 1994, should call or write Sheldon Butts, Deputy
Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800, telefax
(301) 504&hyph;0127, not later than April 28, 1994.
Presentations should be limited to approximately ten minutes. Persons desiring to make presentations must submit
the written text of their presentations to the Office of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994. The Commission reserves
the right to impose further time limitations on all presentations and further restrictions to avoid duplication
of presentations. The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. on May 12, 1994, and will conclude the same day.
Written comments on the Commission's agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996, should be received in the Office
of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994.

Notes on Reimbursable Rates


1Daily percentages are applied to both inpatient and outpatient services provided when billing third party payers
(such as insurance companies). Pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095, the inpatient daily percentages are
55 percent hospital, 5 percent physician, 40 percent ancillary. The outpatient daily percentages are 57 percent
hospital, 10 percent physicians and 33 percent ancillary.
2DoD civilian employees located in overseas areas shall be rendered a bill when services are performed. Payment is
due 60 days from the date of the bill.
3Charges for PRIMUS/NAVCARE and high cost medications/services requested by external providers (Physicians,
Dentists, etc.) are only relevant to the Third Party Collection Program. Third party payers (such as insurance companies)
shall be billed for high cost services in those instances in which non-active duty eligible beneficiaries have medical
insurance and are seen by providers external to a Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and obtain the prescribed
service or medication from an MTF. Eligible beneficiaries are not personally liable for this cost and shall not be
billed by the MTF. The standard cost of high cost medications includes the cost of the drugs and dispensing services.
4All quantities shown are tablets unless otherwise stated. The third party charge is only for the strengths and the
dosage cited. Charges will vary if the strengths and dosage are changed. The method of computing standards costs to
be charged for high cost medications is actual cost to the pharmacy, plus a 30 percent dispensing fee. Only medications
listed in this schedule may be billed. If a different dose is issued for a medication that is listed, only bill if the
cost is $100 or more.
5The attending physician is to complete the common procedure terminology code to indicate the appropriate procedure
followed during cosmetic surgery.
6Cosmetic surgery rates will be charged for dependents of active duty members, retirees, and their dependents and
survivors. The patient shall be charged the rate as specified in the FY 1994 reimbursable rates for an episode of care.
The charges for elective cosmetic surgery are at the full reimbursement rate (designated as the Other rate_in Section
I, ``Inpatient and Outpatient Rates'' and Section II, ``Per Outpatient Visit''). The patient will be responsible
for both the cost of the implant(s) and prescribed rates.



Note: 

The implants and procedures used for the augmentation mammoplasty are in compliance with Federal Drug Administration
guidelines.



7Each regional lipectomy will carry a separate charge. Regions include head and neck, abdomen, flanks, and hips.
8These procedures are inclusive in the minor skin lesions. However, CHAMPUS separates them as noted here. All charges
are for the entire treatment regardless of the number of visits required.

<DOCTITLE>Supplemental Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA</DOCTITLE>



On March 30, 1994, the Air Force signed the Supplemental ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions
included in this Supplemental ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained
in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 4, 1993.


Norton AFB will close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment
Act (BCRA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment
and Closure. This Supplemental ROD documents certain disposal decisions which this office previously deferred,
and modifies certain previous decisions made in the December 15, 1993, Partial ROD supplemented on January 14, 1994.
The decisions in this document, coupled with those in the previous ROD, complete the disposal decisions for Norton
AFB. 

The decision conveyed by the Partial ROD was to dispose of Norton AFB in a manner that enabled the development of a regional
airport with the capacity for commercial and industrial development. This allowed for the central theme of the proposed
future land use plans discussed in the FEIS to be fully implemented. The environmental findings and mitigation measures
contained in the initial ROD remain fully applicable. 

Approximately 109 acres within three (3) noncontiguous parcels are retained within the Department of Defense for
continued military use. This Supplemental ROD contains minor boundary realignments of some parcels previously
addressed. Two (2) parcels comprising approximately 24.9 acres were declared access and are reserved for transfer
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. In total, approximately 1,942 acres are surplus to the needs
of he Federal Government. The base has been divided into twenty-four (24) parcels of land, roadways and utilities.
Five (5) airfield parcels were previously conveyed for public benefit (airport purposes), and three (3) parcels
were previously made available for negotiated sale to eligible public bodies or public sale. Two (2) parcels will
be assigned to the Secretary of the Interior for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance for recreation purposes,
two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Education for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance
for health purposes, and two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for further
disposal as a public benefit conveyance for homeless assistance. Eight (8) parcels will be conveyed by negotiated
sale. The road network is an integral part of all parcels. Primary roads may be conveyed by negotiated sale to an eligible
public body. Secondary roadways that fall within a parcel completely will be included as part of the parcel. The utility
systems are totally integrated systems, prohibiting their separation among the various parcels. Therefore, disposal
of the utility systems will include conditions under which the recipients must provide service to all parcels. Utility
easements will be granted as appropriate. The gas and electric systems with appropriate easements for maintenance
and repair will be conveyed through negotiated sale to utility purveyors, or eligible public bodies. Water and wastewater
are required to support redevelopment efforts and are contingent on the recipient continuing to provide the necessary
service to all parcels. Water and wastewater systems will be assigned to HHS contingent upon formal request for conveyance
for use in the protection of public health. 

The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations,
and all reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment.


Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E.B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809.

supplementary information:

 Suggested software settings for modems are:




Parity: None

Data bits: 8

Stop bits: 1

Terminal emulation: VT100

Duplex: Full




The seven menu options on the system are:

The option to download the following information from the AAIS is available for all selections. 

1. Advanced Planning Briefings for Industry (APBI): APBI provides 5-year projected requirements for AMCCOM ammunition,
weapons, and chemical items, as well as 1-year projected requirements for AMCCOM spare parts. In addition, the system
contains a listing of upcoming conferences which industry may attend, and various publications which are available
for information purposes. 

2. Performance Incentive Contracting (PIC): PIC is designed to obtain the best purchase value for the Government
after considering price and contractor performance history. The Government recognizes that even among responsible
contractors there are different degrees of performance risk. The Government, under this program, is willing to pay
higher prices to lower risk contractors to obtain on-time delivery of quality products. The PIC program works under
the premise that award to a contractor with a good delivery and quality record for the Federal Stock Class (FSC) in question
will improve the chances of the Government receiving a quality product on time. Under the PIC program, an award may
be made to other than the low-price offeror. The on-line system provides the policy, definitions, applicability,
procedures, and clauses/provisions. 

3. Procurement History: The history provided is pertinent to HQ, AMCCOM (R) procurement only. The contractor is prompted
to enter the NIIN (last nine positions of the NSN). If record is found, the latest unit price, award date and contractor
is provided. A former restriction on the number of history requests that the Central Processing Point allowed per
day has been eliminated for those contractors who utilize this system.

4. Solicitation Information: The program provides daily information on solicitations issued from HQ, AMCCOM. The
data displayed is the same type of information currently provided in the lobby area of HQ, AMCCOM. Daily synopses that
are published in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) are available to view or search on a particular keyboard. Cancelled
and not issued status is provided by entering a solicitation number. A hard copy of the solicitation and the technical
data package (TDP) can be requested electronically. Requests are accepted whether you have a Federal Supply Code
for Manufacturers (FSCM) code or not. Viewing the contents of solicitations issued by HQ, AMCCOM can be performed
on-line or downloaded to a personal computer (PC) for further review. 

5. Industrial Committee of Ammunition Procedures (ICAP): The program provides the minutes from recent ICAP meetings.
These minutes are provided in order to make industry more aware of information being discussed by the committee. The
program also contains a forecast of agenda topics and the current roster of the ICAP members identified by the segment
of industry each member represents. The minutes are prepared by industry and are included in the system through the
office of the AMCCOM Command Ombudsman.

6. Excess Production Equipment: Provides information on Government-owned excess production equipment. Three
menu selections provide: (1) Location and amount of excess production equipment; (2) details on sales of production
equipment; (3) listing of production equipment that is identified for excess/redistribution. This allows the user
to search by manufacturer name or key word in the description. 

7. Contractor Performance Certification Program (CP) 2: Provides answers to commonly asked questions concerning
the program and provides a list of who is certified. 

8. Demilitarization Inventory: Data concerning the Army's Demilitarization Inventory (also known as the B5A and
the RRDA (Resource Recovery Disposition Account). This data is intended to provide up-to-date and accurate data
for use in demil workload planning by AMCCOM contractors and installation workload personnel. The Benchmark Prices
database is also available. The data base listing provides the average cost for a particular nomenclature at a specific
location.

9. SMCA Industrial Base Task Force Minutes: Provides the open public release of information from meetings between

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of the DSEIS is to address changes in ``without project'' conditions since filing of the final Environmental
Impact Statement on 27 May 1977.



</SUMMARY>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Tulsa District Corps of Engineers, P.O. Box 61, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74121&hyph;0061.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Mr. John P. Mace, Chief, Environmental Analysis and Support Branch, (918) 669&hyph;7188.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The overall project was authorized for water quality control by the Flood Control Act of 1966, Public Law 89&hyph;789;
as modified by the Flood Control Act approved 31 December 1970, Public Law 91&hyph;611; and as amended by the Water
Resources Development Acts of 1974 and 1976. A final environmental impact statement for the project dated July 1976
was filed and published in the 

Federal Register

 on 27 May 1977. Facilities already constructed include a ring dike at Estelline Springs (Area V), the Bateman low-flow
collection dam on the South Fork of the Wichita River (Area VIII) and Truscott Brine Lake which is located on Bluff Creek,
a tributary of the North Fork of the Wichita River near Truscott, Texas. The Lowrance (Area X) low-flow collection
facility, which will pump into Truscott, is currently under construction.



Funds have been appropriated to begin completion of design and construction of the remaining authorized facilities
at Areas VI, VII, IX, Crowell Brine Lake, XIII, and XIV, Oklahoma and Texas. Significant issues to be addressed in the
DSEIS include changes in the pool size of the Crowell Brine Lake, changes in methods of collection and disposal (Deep
Well Injection) at Areas XIII and XIV, and possible changes in location and types of collection facilities and disposal
at Area VI.

Reasonable Alternatives to be Considered Include: No action, deep well injection, and relocation of the Area VI Brine
Storage Lake.

Significant Issues to be Addressed in the DSEIS Include: The potential impact of decreased chloride concentrations
in the Red River Basin on primary production and sport fish abundance in Lake Texoma, impacts on Federally listed threatened
and/or endangered species, changes in land use at the Area VI disposal site, and any changes in fish and wildlife mitigation
requirements resulting from the noted changes.

A scoping meeting is not planned, however, a news release informing the public and local, state, and Federal agencies
of the proposed action will be published in local newspapers. Comments received as a result of this notice and the news
release will be used to assist the Tulsa District in identifying potential impacts to the quality of the human or natural
environments. Affected Federal, state, or local agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other interested private
organizations and parties may participate in the scoping process by forwarding written comments to the above noted
address.

The DSEIS is expected to be available for public review and comment by June 1994. Any comments and suggestions should
be forwarded to the above noted address no later than 1 May 1994 to be considered in the DSEIS.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following are final revisions pertaining to procedures in the TQAP, PPTMR, and the CONUS Automated Rates System
(CARTS) pamphlet. The program objectives are to reduce the administrative workload for both the PPSOs and the carriers,
and provide a better quality assurance program for the movement of personal property within the Department of Defense.
TQAP wording has not been officially incorporated into the update of the PPTMR.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATES: 

16 July 1994 for the International Program, and 16 August 1994 for the Domestic Program.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Headquarters, Military Traffic Management Command, ATTN: MTOP&hyph;QEC, 5611 Columbia Pike, Falls Church, VA
22041&hyph;5050.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Ms. Betty Wells at (703) 756&hyph;1585, HQMTMC, ATTN: MTOP&hyph;QEC, 5611 Columbia Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041&hyph;5050.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

For reasons set forth in the summary and under the authority of DOD Directives 5126.9 and 4500.34 this revision will
supersede in part the current procedures published in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, Chapter 2, Personal Property Traffic
Management Regulation; the TQAP pamphlet, dated February 1992; and the CONUS Automated Rates System pamphlet, dated
1 May 1991. The proposed revisions were initially published for comments in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 58, Number 196, Wednesday, October 13, 1993, and Volume 58, Number 174, Friday, September 10, 1993. Comments
were received in writing and telephonically during the review of the program, September 1993 through January 1994.
There were 12 individual letter responses to the September 1993 

Federal Register

. This includes letters from carrier associations and bureaus. Sixteen letter responses were received with respect
to the October 13th 

Federal Register

 item. This also included letters from carrier association/bureau. Some changes were made to the proposed revisions
based on the comments received. The significant changes contained in the revision are as follows and will apply in
lieu of cited TQAP pamphlet, DOD 4500.34R, and CARTS paragraphs:



A. Carriers will provide a copy of the DD Form 1840, Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery, to the origin PPSO
within 75 calendar days of delivery of the shipment. The PPSO will sign and return by mail a receipt if a self addressed
stamped card or letter of transmittal is included by the carrier. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.4.c.(8) and
DOD 4500.34R, page A&hyph;23, para 52.e.)



Comments: 

The majority of freight forwarders oppose this change, while the van line carriers prefer to send the form to origin
or have no preference. Most of the carriers commented that they believe the service member should be responsible for
returning the form to a PPSO. The DOD strongly believes it is necessary to cut out the middle-man in the processing of
the DD Form 1840. This will lighten the administrative burden on the PPSOs and the carrier industry as well. In addition
to cutting out the middle man, the time for returning the form has been expanded to accommodate overseas mail. Other
paperwork must be returned to the carrier to show proof of delivery or to ensure payment to the carrier.

B. All shipments will be scored within 12 months of pickup date. If no destination information is known, the origin
PPSO will contact the destination PPSO to confirm the status of the shipment and request feedback on carrier performance
at time of delivery. This will also ensure that if the shipment is still in SIT points will not be taken away from the carrier
for not providing a DD Form 1840. Unless there is evidence in the file to show otherwise, these types of shipments will
usually score at 100. In addition, shipments noted as still in SIT 12 months after pickup will be flagged to prevent
them from being scored again in future cycles. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraphs C.3.e. and f.)



Comments: 

Carriers against the proposal suggested the origin PPSO not make any contact with the destination PPSO for status
on shipments. They would like an automatic score of 100. Again, the DOD believes communication between the origin
and destination PPSO is vital to ensure shipments are scored properly.

C. If the carrier discovers a shipment the PPSO failed to score 12 months after pickup, the carrier must identify the
shipment during the appeal cycle of the DD Form 2497. The shipment will then be scored within 45 days and batch mailed
according to TQAP procedures. This will allow the carrier an opportunity to appeal if necessary. The score will reflect
on the carrier's next semiannual score. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraph C.3.g. and page 26, paragraph C.6.e.)

Comments:

 Comments received on this proposal noted the time period allowed to identify these shipments (during the appeal cycle
of the semiannual evaluation) was one of the busiest times for carriers. It was suggested carriers by allowed to identify
these shipments any time up until the next semiannual performance evaluation and possibly up to 12 months longer.
It was also suggested the score should apply to the most recent semiannual score. The DOD believes few shipments will
fall into this category, as carriers have the option of requesting a score 120 days after delivery. The carrier must
have an opportunity to appeal. Consideration was given to allowing only the 100 scores apply to the present cycle as
it is unlikely those scores will have an appeal. However, there may be circumstances where it may benefit the carrier
for the newly scored shipment to go into the next performance cycle. In the interest of fairness to all, each shipment
will retain the right to appeal, and the score applied to the next performance cycle.


D. A PPSO has up to 12 months from pickup to score shipments. However, a carrier may request a shipment score 120 days
after delivery when proof of delivery is provided. A completed DD Form 1840/1840R will be the only acceptable proof
of delivery. Origin PPSOs will not be limited to using only origin data for scoring, but must ensure they have received
feedback from destination. (Reference TQAP, pages 20&hyph;21, paragraphs C.3.c. through f.)




Comment:

 Those submitting negative comments on this issue suggested there was not need for the origin PPSO to contact the destination
PPSO. The DOD believes it is necessary for PPSOs to communicate shipment information prior to scoring to ensure each
carrier is given the score it earned.


E. Unless a shipment is still in SIT, shipments may be scored under 12 months of the pickup date (see note (3) below) if
all of the following criteria exists:


(1) A completed DD Form 1780 (may be electronic data) or destination feedback from the destination PPSO.


(2) The DD Form 1840 is present and signed by the member and the carrier representative.


(3) Shipments that have been converted to nontemporary storage (NTS) or commercial storage will not require a DD Form
1840 for scoring. The destination PPSO should annotate the DD Form 1780 at the time the shipment is converted and return
the form to origin. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.5.b.)




Comments:

 Comments against the proposal stated if shipments have not been scored within a year, the origin PPSO should not contact
the destination PPSO to get the status of the shipment and the carrier should receive a score of 100. The DOD is making
every attempt to ensure shipments are properly scored. By making it necessary for the origin and destination PPSOs
to communicate there is less chance for an error when scoring a shipment. The DOD has no intention of giving scores of
100 that may not have been earned. This would not be fair to those carriers who do earn them.


F. Carriers will not be required to respond to letters of warning, unless the PPSO specifically requests a written
response. However, if the violations continue the carrier is subject to suspension. (Reference TQAP, pages 6&hyph;7,
paragraph B.3.)



Comments:

 Comments indicated the PPSOs should ensure carriers are sending the letters of warning by certified mail. TQAP already
requires DD Forms 1814, Letters of Warning, be sent certified mail, return receipt requested.

G. Facsimiles will be permitted to meet the deadline for submitting the DD Form 1840. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph
C.4.c.(8))



Comments:

 Carriers were pleased the requirement for a hard copy to follow facsimiles was cancelled as announced at the September
1993, Military Symposium.

H. On long delivery out of SIT shipments, the carrier will return the completed DD Form 619 to the PPSO that authorized
the services. (Reference TQAP, page 33, paragraph C.10.d.)



Comments:

 No significant comments. This change will ensure services authorized are confirmed by the proper authority.

I. When a carrier is suspended for a volume move, it is suspended for the same type service (e.g., All domestic HHGs),
for all shipments out of that activity. The CONUS Automated Rate System (CARTS) pamphlet will be changed. (Reference
CARTS Instruction Pamphlet, Page 28, paragraph 6008.c.)



Comments:

 No significant comments. This is to bring the CARTS pamphlet in line with the TQAP.

J. Shipments turned back by the carrier, or pulled back by the PPSO due to the carrier's inability to perform, will be
uniformly scored at 40 points. This includes shipments that have been packed and/or picked up by the local agent. The
carrier will continue to be charged administrative weight on the TDR if the shipment is turned back or pulled back seven
days or less before the established pickup date or any time after the shipment has been packed and/or picked up. (Reference
TQAP page 32, paragraph C.9.)



Comments:

 No significant comments. In the interest of uniformity and to alleviate confusion in scoring pull back/turn back
shipments, it is believed all such shipments should be scored the same. Shipments pulled back/turned back within
7 days of pickup, must be retendered and often reinventoried, causing more delay in the movement at origin. Therefore,
all these kinds of shipments will be scored the same.

K. Previous proposal to no longer require a 20-day grace period prior to a regular suspension is being withdrawn at
this time for further review within the DOD.

L. Previous proposal allowing destination PPSOs to take action against a carrier, that has a Letter of Intent on file
at the destination installation for outbound service, for inbound/destination performance failures, has been
withdrawn by the DOD.

MTMC considered all comments carefully and has decided to implement changes to the quality assurance program as described
above. The DOD considers the changes necessary to ensure quality assurance standards are applied through better
communication and streamlined procedures.

<USBUREAU>Department of the Navy</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and Reuse of the Naval Base Charleston,
SC</DOCTITLE>





Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of disposal and reuse of the Naval Base
Charleston, South Carolina. This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Realignment and Closure
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510).


Closure of Naval Base Charleston was recommended by the 1993 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission to eliminate
excess naval base berthing capacity while maintaining the overall military value of the remaining bases. The proposed
action to be evaluated in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of Naval Base Charleston
for subsequent reuse.


The Navy intends to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of Naval Base Charleston based on the reasonably
foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the reuse committee_Building Economic
Solutions Together (BEST). In coordination with the BEST Committee's reuse plan, other federal agencies may offer
uses for the property. The EIS will evaluate alternative reuse concepts of the property, including the ``no action''
alternative, which would be retention of the property by the Navy in caretaker status. However, due to provisions
found in the Base Realignment and Closure Act, selection of the ``no action'' alternative would be considered impractical
for the Navy to implement.


The EIS will evaluate the impacts of reuse of Naval Base Charleston on the natural environment such as wetlands and
wildlife habitat and on the socioeconomic environment which includes potential impacts to the regional economy,
housing market, public schools, and tax base. The Navy will conduct a cultural resource survey to determine whether
any sensitive archaeological resources exist within the property. Additionally, the Navy is conducting an Environmental
Baseline Survey to determine if any areas of environmental contamination exist.


The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this action. The Navy will hold public scoping meetings at four different locations
as follows: Wednesday, April 27, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Chicora Neighborhood Center at 2012 Success Street,
North Charleston, South Carolina; Wednesday, April 27, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the North Charleston City Hall,
4900 LaCross Road, North Charleston, South Carolina; Thursday, April 28, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Berkeley
County Office Building, 223 North Live Oak Drive, Moncks Corner, South Carolina; and Thursday, April 28, 1994, beginning
at 7 p.m. at the District 2 Administrative Office Building at 102 Greenwave Boulevard, Summerville, South Carolina.
These meetings will also be advertised in local and regional newspapers.


A brief presentation will precede requests for public comment and identification of additional scoping items. Navy
representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern.
It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested persons take this opportunity to identify
environmental concerns that should be addressed during preparation of the EIS. In the interest of maximizing the
use of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit his/her oral comments to five minutes.


Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which
the commentor believes the EIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping process
should be mailed no later than May 27, 1994, to: Commander, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command,
2155 Eagle Drive, North Charleston, SC 29419&hyph;9010, Attn: William Sloger, (803) 743&hyph;0797.

<DOCTITLE>Naval Research Advisory Committee; Open Meeting</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), notice is hereby given that the
Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel on Naval Research and Development will meet on April 18, 19, and 20, 1994.
The meeting will be held at the Office of Naval Research, 800 North Quincy Street, Ballston Center Tower One, room 915,
Arlington, Virginia. The first session will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on April 18; the second session
will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5 p.m. on April 19; and the third session will commence at 8 a.m. and terminate
at 5 p.m. on April 20, 1994. All sessions of the meeting will be open to the public.

The purpose of the meeting is to provide the Department of the Navy with an assessment of the missions, functions, processes,

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of an altered system of records; deletion of existing systems of records.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Education publishes this notice of an altered
system of records that consolidates ten existing systems of records maintained under the student financial assistance
programs authorized by title IV, the Higher Education Act, 1965, amended, (HEA). The notice is also expanded to cover
the new Federal Direct Student Loan programs authorized under title IV, HEA. The programs involved in this consolidation
include the Federal Direct Student Loan, Federal Insured Student Loan, Federal Family Education Loan, and Federal
Perkins Loan programs. This system will also maintain records under the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity
Grant and Federal Pell Grant programs that are necessary in the collection of overpayments. Because this system is
being expanded to cover one new program, the Department seeks comments on all of the routine uses contained in this
notice. The name and number of the single consolidated system of records is the Title IV Program File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0024).


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments on the proposed routine uses for this system of records must be submitted by May 12, 1994. The Department filed
a report of the altered system of records with the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, the Committee on
Government Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on April 6, 1994. This system of records will become effective
after a 40-day period for OMB review of the system expires on May 16, 1994, unless OMB gives specific notice within the
40 days that the system is not approved for implementation or requests additional time for its review. The Department
will publish any changes to the routine uses that are required as a result of the comments.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Comments on the proposed routine uses should be addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, Information Resource Management
Service, Information Management and Compliance Division, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW.,
room 5624, GSA Regional Office Building 3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;4651. All comments submitted in response to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Education consolidates into a single system of records ten existing systems that are currently
maintained regarding information authorized to be collected under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (title
IV, HEA), as amended. In addition, the system is expanded to include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, authorized
to be collected under Part D of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. 


Currently, ten separate systems of records notices notify the public about the existence of data collected under
title IV, HEA. The consolidation of these systems of records will enable the Department to improve the efficiency
of data maintenance by eliminating the administrative burden and duplication associated with the use of separate
systems. 
The programs involved in this consolidation include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; the Federal Family
Education Loan (formerly Guaranteed Student Loan) Program, which includes the: Federal Stafford Loan, Federal
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, and Federal Consolidation Loan Programs; the Federal Insured
Student Loan (FISL) Program; and the Federal Perkins Loan Program (formerly the National Direct Student Loan Program).
This system will also maintain records regarding individuals participating in the Federal Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grant Program and Federal Pell Grant Program that are necessary for the collection of overpayments.

This 

Federal Register

 notice deletes the names and system numbers of ten existing systems of records and consolidates those files into a
single system of records known as ``Title IV Program File'' 18&hyph;40&hyph;0024. The ten systems to be deleted are:

&bull;Defaulted Guaranteed Loans Submitted to the Department of Justice (18&hyph;40&hyph;0023). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Loan Application File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0024). 
&bull;NDSL Student Loan Files (18&hyph;40&hyph;0025). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Paid Claims File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0026). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Claims and Collections Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0027). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Collection Letters (18&hyph;40&hyph;0028). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Inactive Loan Control Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0029). 
&bull;Guaranteed Loan Program_Loan Control Master File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0030).

Routine uses. 

The routine uses included in this consolidated notice appeared in at least one of the ten separate system notices.
Most of the routine uses in this consolidated notice appeared in all of the system notices that are being consolidated.
Because the System notice is being expanded to cover the new Federal Direct Student Loan Program, the Department asks
for comment on all of the routine uses. 


Categories of individuals. 

The categories of individuals for whom records are maintained under this consolidated system notice will include:
Borrowers who apply for loans under the Federal Direct Student Loan program; borrowers who applied for loans under
the FISL Program; borrowers whose loans defaulted or the borrower died, became totally and permanently disabled,
or had a loan discharged in bankruptcy under the FISL Program and on which ED paid a claim to the holder of the loan; borrowers
whose loans were guaranteed by a guaranty agency and who defaulted under the FFEL Program, if those loans were assigned
by the guaranty agency to ED; FFEL borrowers whose lenders have reported them delinquent or reported their locations
as unknown; FFEL borrowers whose loans were cancelled due to borrower's death or total and permanent disability,
or whose loans were discharged in bankruptcy under the FFEL Program; FFEL borrowers whose loans have been assigned
to ED due to false loan certification; borrowers under the Federal Perkins Loan Program whose loans have been assigned
to ED because of default, and borrowers under the Federal Perkins Loan Program or under the FFEL Program whose loans
have been assigned to ED due to school closing; borrowers whose loans were served by guaranty agencies for which ED
has assumed management responsibility; and Federal Pell and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants
on which overpayments are collected by ED. 
The overall set of individuals who apply for assistance will increase due to the addition of the Federal Direct Student
Loan Program to this system of records notice. 


Purpose of the system. 

The Department needs to maintain records regarding certain individuals who have received title IV student financial
assistance for the following purposes: (1) To verify their identity; (2) to determine program eligibility and benefits;
(3) to permit servicing and collecting of the loan or grant; (4) to locate a delinquent or defaulted debtor or to locate
a recipient owing an overpayment on a grant; (5) to counsel the individual in repayment efforts; (6) to investigate
possible fraud; (7) to verify an individual's, or institution or other entity's compliance with program regulations;
and (8) to initiate legal action against an individual, institution, or other entity involved in program fraud or
abuse. 
This system of records contains numerous technical revisions to the current notice, including one which adds a purpose
clause to the notice to comply with the Office of the Federal Register guidelines. The purpose clause notifies individuals
of the intended use of the information collected in the system. 
Direct access is restricted to authorized contract and agency personnel in the performance of their official duties.
Due to the restructuring of the system notice, it is being published in its entirety.

or grant, permit the servicing and collecting of the loan or grant, prosecute or enforce debarment, suspension, and
exclusionary actions, counsel the individual in repayment efforts, investigate possible fraud and verify compliance

Congressional member disclosure. 

ED may disclose information from this system of records to a congressional office from the record of an individual
in response to an inquiry from the congressional office made at the written request of that individual; however, the
Member's right to the information is no greater than the right of the individual who requested it.

and the procedures contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(f). A consumer reporting agency to which these disclosures may be made
is defined at 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f) and 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3). 



Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system:

<PARENT> FR940412-2-00026 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Retrievability: 



The file is indexed by social security number or name. Data for loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program,
FISL Program, Federal Perkins Loan (formerly National Direct Student Loan) Program, Federal Pell Grant Program,
and some FFELs are retrievable by social security number. 



Safeguards: 



All physical access to the Department of Education site, and the sites of Department contractors where this system
of records is maintained, is controlled and monitored by security personnel who check each individual entering the
building for his or her employee or visitor badge. 
The computer system employed by the Department of Education offers a high degree of resistance to tampering and circumvention.
This security system limits data access to Department of Education and contract staff on a ``need to know'' basis,
and controls individual users' ability to access and alter records within the system. All users of this system of records
are given a unique user ID with personal identifiers. All interactions by individual users with the system are recorded.




Retention and disposal: 



Records of individual loans may be destroyed five years after cancellation, forgiveness or final repayment of the
loan. Records of Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant recipients may be destroyed five years after
the fiscal operations report is filed. Records of Federal Pell Grant recipients may be destroyed five years after
the initial award year has ended, as set forth in appropriate record retention schedules. 



System managers and addresses: 



The System Manager for the title IV program file is the Director, Program Systems Support, Student Financial Assistance
Programs, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 4640, GSA Regional Office Building 3, Washington,
DC 20202&hyph;5258. 



Notification procedure: 



If an individual wishes to determine whether a record exists regarding him or her in the system of records, the individual
should provide to the system manager his or her name, date of birth, social security number, and the name of the school
or lender from which the loan or grant was obtained. Requests for notification about whether the system of records
contains information about an individual must meet the requirements of the Department of Education's Privacy Act
regulations at 34 CFR 5b.5. 



Record access procedures: 



If an individual wishes to gain access to a record in this system, he or she should contact the system manager and provide
information as described in the notification procedure. Requests by an individual for access to a record must meet
the requirements of the Department of Education's Privacy Act regulations at 34 CFR 5b.5. 



Contesting record procedures: 



If an individual wishes to change the content of a record in the system of records, he or she should contact the system
manager with the information described in the notification procedure, identify the specific items to be changed,
and provide a written justification for the change. Requests to amend a record must meet the requirements of the Department
of Education's Privacy Act regulations at 34 CFR 5b.7. 



Record source categories: 



Information is obtained from reports from borrowers and their families, lenders, schools, examining or treating
physicians, employers, credit agencies, Federal and State governmental agencies, and State or private nonprofit
guaranty agencies. However, lenders and guaranty agencies are not a source of information for participants in the
Federal Direct Student Loan Program, since the Department maintains individual records of borrowers for this program.




System exempted from certain provisions of the Act: 



None.

<DOCTITLE>Hunt Refining Co. et al.; Petition for Exemption From Jurisdictional Status</DOCTITLE>


April 6, 1994.



Take notice that on March 17, 1994, Hunt Refining Company (Hunt) and East Mississippi Pipeline Company (East Mississippi),
(referred jointly as Petitioners), filed a request that the Commission exempt the pipeline facilities of Hunt and
East Mississippi from the Commission's jurisdiction on the basis that such facilities are not ``jurisdictional''
within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) but are private, proprietary systems. Petitioners submit
that they are not subject to the filing requirements of sections 6 (schedule of rates and charges), 19(a) (maps and
valuation data), and 20 (annual, periodic, and special reports) of the ICA. In the alternative, petitioners request
that the Commission (a) exempt Hunt and East Mississippi from the filing and reporting requirements which otherwise
would apply, or (b) recognize that Hunt and East Mississippi need not publish a schedule of rates and charges.


The Petitioners state that the facilities for which an exemption is sought are owned entirely by Petitioners and will
be utilized solely to transport crude oil to which Hunt holds title. No other refinery interconnects with the Petitioners'
facilities and, due to the location and service performed by these facilities, requests for access to the facilities
by any third party are extremely unlikely.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April
21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference

<DOCTITLE>National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>



April 6, 1994.



Take notice that on April 1, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;328&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct
and operate a delivery point under National's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000 pursuant
to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection.

National proposes to construct and operate a delivery point located in Ashland Township, Clarion County, Pennsylvania,
for additional deliveries of gas to National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an existing firm
transportation customer. National states that the total volumes to be delivered is estimated to be 910 Mcf annually.
National indicates that this will have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries.

National states that an emergency tap was installed at the proposed location on February 4, 1994, because seven residential
customers of Distribution were without gas. National explains that the seven customers were out of gas due to frozen
wells and related facilities which previously provided for their needs. On March 24, 1994, Distribution filed for
waiver of the initial time limitation because the wells have not returned to sufficient production. National further
states that it is now seeking authorization under its blanket certificate to assure continuation of service beyond
the expiration of the current emergency authorization.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<DOCTITLE>Olympic Pipeline Co.; Petition for Rate Approval</DOCTITLE>



April 6, 1994.



Take notice that on March 25, 1994, Olympic Pipeline Company (Olympic) filed pursuant to &sect;284.123(b)(2) of
the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and equitable
a firm reservation charge of $5.34 per MMBtu and a 100 percent load factor interruptible rate of $0.1755 per MMBtu for
transportation services performed under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

Olympic states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates
an intrastate pipeline system in the State of Louisiana. Olympic proposes an effective date of March 25, 1994. Because

obligation began on December 12, 1993.

Pursuant to &sect;284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will
be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge
for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the
time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation
of views, data, and arguments.

Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.211
and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the
Commission on or before April 21, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available
for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Syracuse Power Co.; Petition to Intervene and Motion to Revoke Self-Certification</DOCTITLE>


April 6, 1994.


Take notice that on April 1, 1994, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (Niagara), filed a petition to intervene and motion
requesting the Commission to revoke qualifying status of the cogeneration facility owned by Syracuse Power Company
(Syracuse). Syracuse's notice of the self-certification was filed with the Commission on July 9, 1993, in the above-captioned
docket.
Niagara maintains that certification should be revoked on the ground that the facility failed to meet the Commission's
operating standard during the 1993 calendar year [See, 18 CFR 292.205(a) (1993)]. Niagara alleges that although
the facility began commercial operation on July 26, 1993, and produced power during the year, no useful thermal output
was produced. This, Niagara states was due to the fact that Purity Water Co., Inc., the facility's steam host, was unable
to obtain the necessary permits from the New York State Department of Health Regulations to produce bottled water.
Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of qualifying status should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in
accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests
must be filed within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 and must be served on the applicant. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party
must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.

Midstream Fuel Service, Inc., Mobile, Alabama, 
Lee&hyph;0083, Reporting Requirements



Midstream Fuel Service, Inc. (Midstream) filed an Application for Exception from the provision of filing Form EIA&hyph;782B,
entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The exception request, if granted,
would permit Midstream to be exempted from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B. In considering the request, the DOE found that
the firm was suffering a gross inequity due to the maternity leave of two of the firm's employees. On March 15, 1994,
the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order which determined that the exception request be granted in part and that
Midstream should be granted an extension of time until May 1994 in which to file the forms due between February 1, 1994,
and May 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision and Order adopts the procedures set forth in the Proposed Decision and Order (

see

 58 FR 68,903 (December 29, 1993)) that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $610,000, plus accrued
interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into with J.R. Cone on May 14, 1993. The funds
were paid by Cone towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving
the sale of crude oil during the period from November 1973 through February 1977. The DOE is currently holding the funds
in an interest bearing account pending distribution. 



The OHA has determined to distribute the Cone Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement
of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP,
crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined
petroleum products. Refunds to the states will be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum
products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be based on the volume of petroleum
products they purchased. 

Applications for Refund must be postmarked no later than June 30, 1994. As we state in the Decision, any party who has
previously filed an Application for Refund in the crude oil refund proceedings should not file another Application
for Refund. The previously filed crude oil application will be deemed filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures
are finalized.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy 



Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 



Name of Firm: J.R. Cone 

Date of Filing: November 16, 1993 

Case Number: LEF&hyph;0118 




On November 16, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
funds which J.R. Cone (Cone) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a Consent Order entered into by Cone and the DOE on May 14,
1993. 

On March 25, 1983, the OHA issued a Remedial Order (RO) finding that Cone had erroneously classified crude oil produced
from two oil bearing properties as crude oil produced from stripper well properties. On May 14, 1993, Cone and the DOE
entered into a Consent Order settling all claims arising from the RO. Pursuant to the Consent Order, Cone has remitted
$610,000 to the DOE. These funds have been held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department
of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. 

In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 C.F.R. part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requested
in its petition that the OHA establish special refund procedures to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations
which were resolved by the Consent Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.




I. Jurisdiction and Authority 



The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan for distributing funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, see the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C.
&sect;&sect;4501&hyph;07 (1988), 

Office of Enforcement

, 9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981), and 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). 



II. The Proposed Decision and Order 



We considered the ERA's petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Cone Consent Order fund
and determined that such a proceeding was appropriate. On December 20, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order
(PDO) setting forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. 

See 

58 Fed. Reg. 68,903 (December 29, 1993). In the PDO, we stated our intent to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund
procedures, as set out below, to distribute the funds obtained through the Cone Consent Order. 

The PDO provided a period of 30 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 for interested parties to file comments regarding the tentative distribution process. More than 30 days has elapsed
and the OHA has received no comments on the proposed distribution process for the Consent Order funds. Consequently,
the procedures will be adopted as proposed. 



III. The Refund Procedures 



A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 



We adopt the tentative determination of the PDO to distribute the funds obtained with the Cone Consent Order in accordance
with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986)(The
MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement. 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation

, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).
The MSRP establishes that 40% of the crude oil funds will be remitted to the Federal government, another 40% to the states,
and up to 20% may be initially reserved for payment of claims to injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies
remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the Federal government and the states
in equal amounts. 

The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. 

See 

Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for filing
of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund
proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it had received
pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This notice was published at 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April
10 Notice).

<DOCNO> FR940412-2-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude
oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase
volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period,
and (2) show that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum
products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged
crude oil overcharges. End-users, therefore, need only submit documentation of their purchase volumes. 

See City of Columbus, Georgia, 

16 DOE &para; 85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that we would calculate crude oil refunds on a per gallon (or volumetric)
basis. We obtained this figure by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products
in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined
in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases. 

See, e.g., Shell Oil Co., 

17 DOE &para; 85,204 (1988) (

Shell

); 

Mountain Fuel Supply Co.

, 14 DOE &para; 85,475 (1986) (Mountain Fuel). 


B. Refund Claims 


We adopt the PDO's proposed determination to use the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the
monies in the Cone Consent Order fund. We have chosen to reserve 20% of the fund, $122,000, plus accrued interest, for
direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. 
The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims filed in this proceeding in a manner consistent with our previous crude
oil refund proceedings under Subpart V. 

See Mountain Fuel, 

14 DOE at 88,869. Claimants in this proceeding will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products
and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged overcharges. 
We adopt a presumption that the crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants which were
(1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations
promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h
(1988). Under this presumption, end-user claimants need not submit documentation to show injury, and may become
eligible for a refund by simply documenting their purchase volumes. 

See Shell, 

17 DOE at 88,406. 
Petroleum retailer, refiner, and reseller applicants must submit detailed documentation of injury. They may not
rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in some refined products refund cases. 

Id. 

These applicants may, however, use econometric evidence of the type found in the 

OHA Report on Stripper Well Overcharges, 

6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 90,507 (1985).

If a claimant has executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established by the Stripper Well
Agreement, it has waived its rights to file an application for Subpart V crude oil refund monies. 

See Mid-America Dairymen 

v. 

Herrington, 

878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 26,617 (1989); 

In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 

707 F. Supp. 1267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 26,613 (1987). 
As we have stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant need only submit one application for its share of
all available crude oil overcharge funds. 

See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 

15 DOE &para; 85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim in any other crude oil refund need not file another
claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings finalized to date. The DOE
has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.


See 

58 Fed. Reg. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per
gallon. While we anticipate that the applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988, will receive a supplemental
refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional
refunds. 

See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co., 

21 DOE &para; 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 
To apply for a crude oil refund, a claimant should submit an Application for Refund containing all of the following
information: 
(1) Identifying information including the claimant's name, current business address, business address during
the refund period, taxpayer identification number or social security number, a statement indicating whether the
claimant is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business entity, the name, title, and telephone
number of a person to contact for any additional information, and the name and address of the person who should receive
the refund check.

1

 If the Applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the Applicant
should specify these names; 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary.
An applicant that does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if
one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications, and is requested pursuant to our authority
under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &sect;4502(b)(1) (1988), and
the regulations codified at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for
statistical, auditing or archiving purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential
violation of civil or criminal law. Unless an Applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available
to the public in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

1973, through January 27, 1981, an annual schedule displaying the total number of gallons of each petroleum product
purchased during this refund period, and the total number of gallons of all petroleum products claimed on the refund
application; 
(5) An explanation as to how the Applicant obtained the above mentioned purchase volumes, and, if estimates were used,
a description of the method of estimation; 
(6) A statement that neither the claimant, its parent firm, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, nor assigns has
waived any right it may have to receive a crude oil refund (e.g. by having executed and submitted a valid waiver accompanying
a claim to any escrow accounts established pursuant to the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement); 
(7) A statement that the Applicant has not filed any other refund application in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding;

(8) If the Applicant is not an end-user, was covered by the DOE price regulations, or is related to the petroleum industry,
a showing that the Applicant was injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges; 
(9) If the Applicant is a regulated utility or a cooperative, certification that it will pass on the entirety of any
refund received to its customers, will notify its state utility commission, or other regulatory agency, or membership
body of the receipt of any refund, and a brief description as to how the refund will be passed along; 
(10) The statement listed below signed by the individual Applicant or a responsible official of the company filing
the refund application: 
I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true to the best of my
knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal government
may be subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001 (1988). I understand that the information
contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application
which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. 
All applications should be either typed or printed and clearly labelled ``Application for Crude Oil Refund.'' Each
Applicant must submit an original and one copy of the Application. If the Applicant believes that any information
in its Application is confidential and does not wish for this information to be publicly disclosed, it must submit
an original Application clearly marked ``confidential,'' containing the confidential information, and two 
copies of the Application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications should be sent to:
Subpart V Crude Oil Overcharge Refunds, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence
Ave., S.W., Washington, DC 20585. 
The filing deadline is June 30, 1994. Even though an Applicant is not required to use any specific form for its crude
oil refund application, a suggested form has been prepared by the OHA and may be obtained by sending a written request
to the address given above. 


C. Payments to the Federal Government and the States 


Under the terms of the MSRP, 40% of the alleged crude oil overcharge amounts subject to this Decision, $244,000, plus
accrued interest, will be disbursed to the Federal government and the remaining 40%, $244,000, plus accrued interest,
will be disbursed to the states for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption
of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state
will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the 

Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 

6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 90,509 at 90,687 (1986). When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations
and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement
Agreement. 
It Is Therefore Ordered That: 
(1) Applications for Refund from the funds remitted by J.R. Cone pursuant to the Consent Order finalized between J.R.
Cone and the Department of Energy on May 14, 1993, may now be filed. 
(2) All Applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) must be filed in duplicate and postmarked no later than June
30, 1994. 
(3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of Departmental Accounting and Financial Systems Development,
Office of the Controller of the Department of Energy shall take all steps necessary to transfer $610,000 and all interest
accrued from the Cone subaccount (Account No. 676C00208Z) pursuant to Paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this Decision.

(4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $244,000 (plus interest) of the funds obtained pursuant
to Paragraph (3) above into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking- States,'' Number 999DOE003W. 
(5) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $244,000 (plus interest) of the funds obtained pursuant

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award on a noncompetitive basis a cooperative agreement
to Pen Kem, Inc. The cooperative agreement is a continuation of work under a former DOE cooperative agreement and will
support development of the active ultrasonic spectroscopy for shape characterization efforts which began in 1991
as a part of the PSD sensor project. DOE support is estimated at $150,000 for a twelve month period.



</SUMMARY>
<FURTHER>
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Stanley F. Sobczynski, DOE Project Manager, Office of Conservation Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington,
DC 20585, (202) 585&hyph;1878.



</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The anticipated objectives to be achieved include the following:



_Development of methodology to infer shape characteristics using ultrasonic response measured under various imposed
flow fields;

_Design and fabrication of an R&amp;D prototype slurry characterization chamber (SCC); and


_Valuation of key concepts using model systems (specially prepared clays with controlled shape variations) in the
laboratory and experimental evaluation of proposed techniques for monitoring delamination of kaolin will be conducted
to identify practical limitations.

The probability of success is high because of Pen Kem's experience and continued work with R&amp;D in the field of colloids.
Since the development of the new PSD sensor prototype, development of a new PSD sensor based on ultrasound has been
reported in Europe. Preliminary market exploration of the commercial PSD instrument was conducted at the 1992 Pen
Kem User's forum in Paris in November 1992.

Accomplishments during the initial phase of the project indicate that Pen Kem will successfully achieve these objectives
with continued DOE funding and that competition for support would result in considerable delay in achieving some
of the results anticipated during the upcoming phase of the project as well as inhibit the objectives of the Office
of Conservation Energy. Award is therefore restricted to Pen Kem, Inc.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 31, 1994 (59 FR 4281), EPA published a Clean Water Act public notice. This notice was published as the result
of an administrative error. It was substantially identical to a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50548). EPA did not intend to provide a second public notice and comment period. Therefore,
EPA is withdrawing the notice published on January 31, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules</DOCTITLE>



Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 

Federal Register

.

The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed
acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

Agreement Containing Consent Order



The Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission''), having initiated an investigation of the acquisition by Martin
Marietta Corporation (``Martin Marietta''), of certain assets of the Space Systems Division of General Dynamics
Corporation (``General Dynamics''), and it now appearing that Martin Marietta, hereinafter sometimes referred
to as proposed respondent, is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to refrain from certain acts and
to provide for other relief:

It is hereby agreed by and between proposed respondent, by its duly authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel
for the Commission that:

1. Proposed respondent Martin Marietta is a corporation, organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue
of the laws of the State of Maryland, with its office and principal place of business located at 6801 Rockledge Drive,
Bethesda, Maryland 20817.

2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.

3. Proposed respondent waives: a. Any further procedural steps;

b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

d. Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 

Provided, however, 

if, prior to the date the Commission issues its complaint and decision, proposed respondent notifies the Commission
in writing that it has abandoned its proposed acquisition as described in the draft of complaint and has withdrawn
any related notifications filed pursuant to Section 7A of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18a, the Commission
will not issue its complaint and decision.

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn
by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules, and if proposed respondent
has not notified the Commission that it has abandoned its proposed acquisition pursuant to paragraph 4 of this agreement,
the Commission may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form
and substance with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to refrain
from certain acts in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so
entered, the order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner
and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery
by the U.S. Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's
address as stated in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to
any other manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation or interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the order.

7. Proposed respondent has read the draft of complaint and order contemplated hereby. Proposed respondent understands
that once the order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has provisionally accepted an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Martin Marietta Corporation (``Martin Marietta''), under which Martin Marietta's satellite division
would be prohibited from gaining access to any non-public information that Martin Marietta's expendable launch
vehicle division receives from competing satellite producers in its capacity as a provider of launch vehicles.

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.

Martin Marietta is a significant competitor in the market for the manufacture and sale of satellites. On December
22, 1993, Martin Marietta agreed to acquire General Dynamics Corporation's Space Systems Division, which manufactures
the Atlas expendable launch vehicles. Following this acquisition, Martin Marietta would be the only United States
supplier in the market for Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles as well as a competitor in the satellite market.
The proposed complaint alleges that the acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, because Martin
Marietta's satellite division could gain access to competitively significant and non-public information concerning
other satellite suppliers' products. As a result, the proposed acquisition increases the likelihood that competition
between satellite suppliers would decrease and that advancements in satellite research, innovation, and quality
would be reduced.

The proposed Consent Order prohibits Martin Marietta from disclosing any non-public information Martin Marietta
receives in its capacity as a provider of expendable launch vehicles from a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin
Marietta's satellite division. Under the proposed Order, Martin Marietta may only use such information in its capacity
as a provider of expendable launch vehicles. Non-public information is defined in the Order as any information not
in the public domain furnished by a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin Marietta's expendable launch vehicle
division or General Dynamics in their capacity as providers of expendable launch vehicles and designated as proprietary
information.
The Commission anticipates that the effect of the proposed Order will be to maintain the opportunity for full competition
in the market for the research, development, manufacture and sale of satellites by limiting the ability of one significant
competitor to use information obtained from other competitors.

Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Martin Marietta is also required to deliver a copy of the Order to any United
States satellite owner or manufacturer prior to obtaining any information that is outside the public domain. One
year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Martin Marietta will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen on Proposed Consent Agreement With Martin Marietta Corp. File
No. 941&hyph;0038



Respondent Martin Marietta Corporation manufactures satellites, which are launched into orbit by expendable launch
vehicles, some of which it also manufactures. It proposes to acquire the Space Systems Division of General Dynamics
Corporation, which manufactures Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles. The theory of the complaint is that if
this acquisition is consummated, Martin Marietta's launch vehicle division will gain access to trade secrets concerning
the products of other satellite manufacturers, and will transfer such information to Martin Marietta's satellite
division, which will use it to injure its competitors. The Commission's order would enjoin Martin Marietta from misusing
its rivals' confidential information in this manner.

Vertical integration, and combinations designed to achieve the efficiencies of such integration, are common phenomena,
particularly in the aerospace industry. Accordingly, it would seem that there are already ample opportunities for
the sort of abusive information-sharing which concerns the Commission. However, equally common are contractual
obligations between vertically integrated companies, and firms that do business with one of their divisions, to
prevent the sharing of those firms' confidential business information with other parts of the conglomerate with
which they compete. The question then is whether such contracts are sufficient to avoid any competitive problem,
or whether government-imposed requirements are necessary; if there exists a significant number of substantiated
incidents of such activity, then private agreements would not seem adequate. However, the opposite appears to be
the case.

While various Commission personnel have, in recent years, exhorted the business community to be sensitive to antitrust
concerns stemming from the sharing of business information, Commission enforcement actions in this area have been
rare, and no case has involved the strategic misuse of proprietary information so as to injure a competitor. Furthermore,
Martin Marietta currently manufactures both satellites and launch vehicles, and is already privy to competitively
significant information from other satellite manufacturers, yet I am unaware of any instance where it has been alleged
that proprietary information has been used for exclusionary purposes by Martin Marietta, or indeed by any other aerospace
manufacturer. As a result, it seems fair to conclude that contractual obligations prohibiting such behavior, coupled
with the threat of business tort and treble-damage antitrust suits, are sufficient deterrents. Moreover, as the
amount of available business in the aerospace industry continues to dwindle, it is hard to imagine that developing
a reputation for abusing confidential information would enhance any company's competitiveness.

The Commission's proposed consent is somewhat puzzling in its coverage. If the theory of the complaint is correct_that
Martin Marietta's dominant power in the launch vehicle market would facilitate anticompetitive information-sharing
in the satellite market_why would the company stop there? The theory would seem to support as well allegations of other
exclusionary and tying practices, yet these are not included. The Commission, correctly I believe, concluded that
there was no evidence to support such charges; I therefore find it strange that it chose to go forward on the equally
speculative information-sharing allegations.

In short, I do not believe that the evidence supports the theory behind the Commission's complaint, nor that a Commission
order would be superior to privately negotiated confidentiality agreements for protecting the trade secrets of
satellite manufacturers. I dissent.

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised Compliance Policy Guide (CPG)
7126.33 entitled ``Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds.'' The CPG revises the action levels for aflatoxins
in peanut products intended for animal feed use (i.e., peanuts, peanut meal, peanut hulls, peanut skins, and ground
peanut hay) and provides guidance on levels of aflatoxin contamination of peanut products intended for use in animal
feeds which, in the agency's view, may be necessary to support a charge of adulteration under certain provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). FDA is inviting public comment concerning the revised action levels
for peanut products that contain aflatoxins and that are shipped in interstate commerce for use in animal feeds.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>

</FURTHER>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA's use of action levels is defined in &sect;509.4(c)(1) (21 CFR 509.4(c)(1)) of FDA's regulations governing unavoidable
contaminants in animal food and food-packaging material. FDA is announcing that it has revised CPG 7126.33 ``Action
Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds'' to reflect changes in the action levels for aflatoxins in peanut products
intended for animal feed use, in accordance with &sect;509.4(c)(2), and to provide guidance on levels of aflatoxin
contamination of peanut products. FDA is inviting public comment on the revised action levels for aflatoxins in peanut
products shipped in interstate commerce and intended for certain food-producing animals. The revised action levels
are: (1) 100 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxins for peanut products intended for breeding beef cattle, breeding swine,
or mature poultry; (2) 200 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing swine (i.e., 100 pounds or greater);
and (3) 300 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot) beef cattle.


The original 20 ppb action level remains unchanged for aflatoxins in peanut products for use by immature animals,
dairy animals, and for aflatoxins in peanut products for which the intended use is not known (CPG 7126.33). Both the
revised action levels and the one that remains unchanged were the subject of a memorandum that FDA's Associate Commissioner
for Regulatory Affairs issued on December 7, 1990, to the FDA field offices (hereinafter referred to as the December
7, 1990, memorandum) (Ref. 1). 
Aflatoxins are added poisonous or added deleterious substances which, depending upon their level in food or feed,
may cause the food or feed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)). This section
states that a food (or feed) is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains an added poisonous or deleterious substance
``which may render [the food (or feed)] injurious to health.'' If the government charges such a violation of the act,
the government must show that there is a reasonable possibility of harm. Thus the action levels for aflatoxin are intended
to represent levels of contamination above which, in the agency's view, the government could satisfy the ``may render
it injurious'' test under section 402(a)(1) of the act.
Based on available scientific data, the agency believes that consumption of products containing aflatoxins in excess
of 20 ppb may be injurious to the health of humans and immature animals, and that if such products are fed to dairy cattle,
aflatoxin residues in fluid milk products that approach 0.5 ppb, the current action level for aflatoxin residues
in such products (CPG 7106.10), may result. In 1989, FDA published revised action levels for aflatoxin in corn intended
for use in animal feed (Ref. 2). FDA revised the action levels, which appear in CPG 7126.33, because it was able to further
define subgroups for which levels of aflatoxin greater than 20 ppb may be necessary to support a ``may be injurious
to health'' charge of adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act. Thus, for finishing swine, aflatoxin levels
in excess of 200 ppb can support the charge, while levels above 300 ppb aflatoxin in corn and peanut products can support
a charge under section 402(a)(1) of the act when the corn or peanut products are intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot)
beef cattle. For breeding beef cattle, breeding swine, and mature poultry, corn and peanut products containing aflatoxin
in excess of 100 ppb aflatoxin can support the adulteration charge. Furthermore, FDA concluded from its evaluation
that meat and eggs from these animals would not contain increased residues of aflatoxin. For immature animals and
dairy cows, aflatoxin levels in excess of 20 ppb can support the adulteration charge. For all other species and commodities
the action level remains at 20 ppb until revisions to CPG 7126.33 are warranted.
In deciding to revise the action levels for aflatoxin in peanut products, FDA relied on the data in the support paper
entitled ``Background Paper to Support Action Levels for Aflatoxin-Contaminated Corn'' (Ref. 2). Based on this
information, FDA concluded that the inclusion of aflatoxin-contaminated peanut products in animal feed at the revised
action levels would have a negligible effect on the tissue residue.
Accordingly, the agency has adopted and will use the revised action levels as a basis for guiding its enforcement of
section 402(a)(1) of the act, provided FDA is assured that peanut products in interstate commerce that contain more
than 20 ppb aflatoxin are destined for the appropriate subgroups of animals. Without such assurance, the agency may
conclude that the peanut products could be destined for humans, immature animals, or dairy cattle and, if it bears
or contains more than 20 ppb aflatoxin, FDA believes that the Government would probably prevail in an enforcement
action charging adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act.
In December 7, 1990, memorandum (Ref. 1) the agency recognized that all action levels, including those for aflatoxins,
must be viewed and used as guidance rather than a definitive enforcement standard. The agency's action levels are
not binding on the courts, the public (including food producers), or the agency. (See 55 FR 20782 (May 21, 1990).) There
may be situations where circumstances warrant enforcement action at levels below an action level or where enforcement
action is not warranted even though an action level is exceeded. In considering enforcement action where aflatoxin
levels are below the pertinent action level, FDA field offices must take into account the agency's ability to support
the adulteration charge that will be included in the complaint. If a field office believes that enforcement action
is warranted at levels below an action level, then the recommendation for enforcement action should include all compelling
reasons for pursuing such action. Similar consideration is required if a field office believes that enforcement
action where aflatoxin levels are above pertinent action levels is not warranted.
The statements made in CPG 7126.33 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA or to create or confer any rights,
privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA guidance.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this notice in response to a notice of referral for action on the use
of bleached food-contact paper products contaminated with polychlorinated dibenzo-

p

-dioxins (PCDD's) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF's) that was issued by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). FDA agrees with EPA's decision to refer this issue to FDA
because, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), FDA has authority to take appropriate action to
ensure that paper and paperboard intended for food-contact use are safe. This notice sets out the various options
that FDA is considering regarding the issue of PCDD and PCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products
and encourages interested persons to submit pertinent data and other comments on this issue.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background


PCDD's and PCDF's are formed in trace amounts as byproducts of certain chemical processes, such as bleaching of paper,
incineration, and manufacturing of certain chlorinated phenols. They are generally produced as a complex mixture
of related compounds or congeners. The PCDD's and PCDF's are classes of 75 and 135 congeners, respectively, the most
toxic of which is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-

p

-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD has been shown to be a potent animal carcinogen, and EPA has classified it as a ``probable human
carcinogen.'' 
In order to assess the hazards of mixtures of PCDD's and PCDF's, scientists have agreed on the use of international
toxicity equivalency factors to express the comparative toxicity of these chemicals as fractions of the toxicity
of TCDD, the most toxic and most studied congener of the group (Ref. 1). This system expresses the amount of PCDD's and
PCDF's present in terms of TCDD toxic equivalents and estimates the risk for a mixture as if it were one chemical compound.
Under this system, 2,3,7,8-dibenzofuran (TCDF), the most potent of the PCDF's, has been assessed a TCDD toxic equivalency
of 0.1. 
Although the occurrence of low levels of PCDD's and PCDF's in the environment has been known for years, it has been only
recently that scientists' ability to identify and quantify them has greatly improved. Based on data obtained in studies
carried out in several countries, the average person is exposed to approximately 1.2 picograms (pg) (10

-12

 grams) of TCDD equivalents/kilogram (kg) body weight/day (Ref. 2). This low level background exposure is mostly
dietary, from foods such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs. 
In 1987, results of EPA's National Dioxin Study showed that fish located downstream from paper mills had higher than
expected levels of TCDD and TCDF. This finding prompted EPA and the American Paper Institute (API) to conduct a joint
study of five paper mills to discover the source of the TCDD and TCDF contamination. The results of this study: (1) Confirmed
the presence of parts per trillion (ppt) levels of TCDD and TCDF in pulp and sludge; (2) confirmed parts per quadrillion
(ppq) levels of these substances in wastewater from these mills; and (3) identified a particular chlorine bleaching
process as the source of the contaminants. Chlorine or chlorine derivatives are often used as the primary bleaching
agent in the process of making bleached paper products.
These results prompted FDA to begin its own investigation of TCDD and TCDF contamination of wood pulp and finished
paper products that may contact food and ultimately migrate into the packaged food. Because the bulk of the TCDD toxic
equivalents associated with PCDD and PCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products are attributable
to the presence of TCDD and TCDF, FDA's investigation has focused on the levels of these two chemicals in bleached food-contact
paper products. 
On April 24, 1987, FDA met with representatives of the National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement
(NCASI) to discuss protocols for analyzing for residual TCDD and TCDF levels in bleached wood pulp and in various food-contact
paper products. Under these protocols, newly developed, highly sensitive analytical methods were used by individual
pulp mills to identify those specific processes that contributed to the formation of TCDD and TCDF so that industry
could identify manufacturing changes that could be made to reduce or eliminate such contaminants in the finished
paper products. FDA also asked industry representatives to conduct extraction studies to measure the extent of migration
of TCDD and TCDF from uncoated and coated paper and paperboard into food simulating solvents. 
In May of 1988, NCASI released a report entitled ``Assessment of the Risks Associated with Potential Exposure to Dioxin
Through Consumption of Coffee Brewed Using Bleached Paper Coffee Filters'' (Ref. 3). This study was conducted because
given the presence of residual dioxin contaminants in bleached paper coffee filters and the high temperature of the
water that is passed through the filters, there appeared to be a high potential for migration of such contaminants
into the brewed coffee. Analysis of 5 different bleached paper coffee filters found measurable levels of TCDD and
TCDF ranging from 2.2 to 6.6 ppt TCDD toxic equivalents in the paper. Migration studies indicated that 65 to 90 percent
of the TCDD equivalents present in the bleached paper coffee filters could migrate into the coffee, depending on brewing
conditions. 
In October of 1988, FDA received the results of a Canadian Government survey that detected TCDD and TCDF in milk packaged
in bleached paper cartons (Ref. 4). TCDD was found in five of eight samples of whole milk packaged in coated, bleached
paper milk cartons at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 0.056 ppt with an average concentration of 0.038 ppt. TCDF
was found in all eight samples at concentrations ranging from 0.064 to 2.46 ppt (average concentration of 0.98 ppt).
Somewhat higher levels were found in cream packaged in coated, bleached paper milk cartons. Analyses of similar food
products packaged in plastic or glass containers showed at least tenfold lower levels of TCDD and TCDF, which were
most likely a result of background contamination. 
In the spring of 1989, FDA conducted a survey of milk packaged in bleached paper cartons from five U.S. manufacturers
(Ref. 5). TCDD was found in 4 of 15 samples of whole milk packaged and stored in one-half pint cartons at refrigerated
temperatures for 14 days. The TCDD concentrations, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 ppt, were obtained using an analytical
method that could determine amounts at or above 0.02 ppt. TCDF was detected in 7 of 15 samples at levels from 0.14 to 0.62
ppt. The detection limit for TCDF was 0.1 ppt. Because neither TCDD nor TCDF was detected in bulk or nonpackaged milk
collected at the same dairies before being packaged, the results confirm that these contaminants can migrate out
of the bleached paper carton and into the milk. 
Because of FDA's concern about the potential for exposure to TCDD and TCDF from other bleached paper food-contact
articles, FDA requested that the paper industry provide detailed information that could be used to determine what
other bleached paper articles should be the subject of detailed migration studies. Based on the results of the industry
survey, FDA also requested, in February 1989, that the paper industry develop migration data for those paper food-contact
articles posing the greatest potential for exposure to TCDD and TCDF. In response to this request, the paper industry
submitted the results of migration studies for the following paper articles: (1) Milk cartons (Ref. 6), (2) coffee
filters (Ref. 3), (3) half-and-half (cream) cartons (Ref. 7), (4) orange juice cartons (Ref. 8), (5) coffee cups (Ref.
9), (6) soup cups (Ref. 10), (7) dual-ovenable trays (Ref. 11), (8) plates (Ref. 12), and (9) microwave popcorn bags
(Ref. 13).
In 1990, FDA used data from these migration studies, to develop a quantitative risk assessment for bleached paper
food-contact articles containing TCDD and TCDF residues. The procedures that FDA used in this evaluation were similar
to the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associated with the presence of minor amounts of carcinogenic
impurities in various food and color additives (see 49 FR 13018, April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of carcinogenic
contaminants has two aspects: (1) Assessment of dietary exposure to the contaminants from the consumption of the
additive and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable human exposure.
In addition to the exposure data derived from the industry studies described above, FDA considered exposure from
four other bleached paper articles that were not subjected to migration testing (bakery cartons, ice cream cartons,
tea bags, and margarine wrappers). An exposure estimate for each of these articles was derived using an estimated
migration level based on an assumed residue of 17 ppt TCDD equivalents in the paper article (the average level of TCDD
equivalents found to be in paper pulp in a study of 104 paper mills carried out in 1988 and 1989) (Ref. 14). In its exposure
estimates, FDA also considered the types of food that come into contact with paper articles and the amounts of these
types of food that are ingested daily by consumers. Based on the results of the migration studies and migration estimates
as well as food consumption information, FDA estimated the daily intake of TCDD equivalents occurring as a result
of migration into food from bleached paper food-contact articles to be no greater than 0.15 pg/kg body weight/day
(Ref. 14).
In its 1990 risk assessment, the agency used data from a 
2-year chronic toxicity and oncogenicity study carried out by Kociba et al. (Ref. 15) on TCDD fed to rats to estimate
the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached
food-contact paper products. The results of the bioassay on TCDD showed that the material was carcinogenic for rats
under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular
carcinomas and adenomas as well as squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, hard palate, nasal turbinates, and tongue.
FDA's toxicologists further concluded that given the paucity of TCDD bioassay data, the Kociba et al. bioassay provided
the appropriate basis on which to calculate an estimate of the upper-bound level of lifetime carcinogenic risk from
exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents stemming from the use of bleached food-contact paper products.
The agency used a linear-at-low-dose extrapolation from the doses used in the Kociba et al. bioassay to the very low
levels of TCDD toxic equivalents encountered under actual conditions of use of bleached food-contact paper products.
This procedure is not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate it because
the extrapolation models used are designed to estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. Using a linear-at-low-dose
extrapolation method and the tumor incidence data based on the original classification of tumors found in the Kociba
et al. study, the FDA estimated a carcinogenic unit risk of 16 x 10

-6

 for an intake of 1 pg/kg body weight/day of TCDD toxic equivalents. Using this carcinogenic risk for TCDD and a daily
dietary exposure of 0.15 pg of TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day (based on data obtained from 1988 to 1990), FDA's
1990 risk assessment estimated that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
that result from the use of bleached food-contact paper products at that time would be 2.5 x 10

-6

 or 2.5 in 1 million (Ref. 16). Because of the conservative assumptions used to obtain the exposure estimate, actual
lifetime-averaged individual exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents is expected to be substantially less than the estimated
daily intake, and therefore, the actual risk would be less than the calculated upper-bound limit of risk.
This risk was considered low by both FDA and EPA (December 26, 1990, 55 FR 53047). However, because the then current
levels of PCDD's and PCDF's (mostly TCDD and TCDF) in bleached white paper were capable of being reduced by the pulp
and paper industry through changes in manufacturing procedures, EPA considered the risk associated with PCDD's
and PCDF's in food-contact paper products to be ``unreasonable'' in accordance with section 9(a) of TSCA (55 FR 53047).

EPA has the authority to require the reduction of ``unreasonable'' risk associated with bleached paper products
under section 6(a) of TSCA, which states that EPA may prohibit or limit production of a chemical substance that presents
an ``unreasonable'' risk to human health or the environment. However, under section 9(a) of TSCA, if EPA determines
that the risk can be reduced by an action taken by another agency, it may refer such action to the other agency. 
In the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 26, 1990, EPA announced that under section 9(a) of TSCA, it was referring action to FDA on the use of food-contact
paper products contaminated with PCDD's and PCDF's. Specifically, EPA has requested that FDA do the following: (1)
Assess the risk associated with PCDD and PCDF contaminated bleached food-contact paper products; (2) determine
if this risk may be prevented or reduced by action taken under its own authority, and (3) if so, initiate the appropriate
regulatory action.


II. FDA's Response to EPA's Referral for Action


FDA agrees with EPA's decision to refer the use of bleached food-contact paper products that may be contaminated with
PCDD's and PCDF's (mostly TCDD and TCDF) to FDA because under the act, FDA has the authority to take appropriate regulatory
action to ensure that bleached paper and paperboard intended for food-contact use are safe. At the time that FDA received
this referral, the agency considered whether immediate regulatory action was necessary to ensure the safe use of
bleached food-contact paper products. As stated above, FDA's risk assessment in 1990 of exposure to TCDD and TCDF,
resulting from the use of those types of bleached food-contact paper products that have the greatest potential for
migration of these substances into food, produced an estimated upper-bound worst-case lifetime risk of 2.5 in 1 million.
However, the estimated daily dietary intake used in this risk assessment was based on data obtained from 1988 to 1990.
By the time FDA received the referral, many of the paper mills that make bleached paper had made or were in the process
of making manufacturing changes to reduce or eliminate residual TCDD and TCDF levels in bleached paper intended for
use in contact with food. Therefore, rather than expressing the risk in terms of an average 70-year lifespan, FDA believed
that it was more appropriate to view the carcinogenic risk in terms of yearly exposure during the limited time needed
by the paper industry to complete the manufacturing changes necessary to reduce the levels of such contaminants in
paper products. 
An upper-bound worst-case lifetime risk of 2.5 in 1 million corresponds to less than 0.04 in 1 million for each year
of exposure. Based on this level of risk per year of exposure, FDA felt at the time that it received the referral that
the continued use of bleached paper and paperboard in contact with food was safe during the time needed by FDA to complete
its evaluation of TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products. FDA also felt at that time
that it should conduct a new lifetime risk assessment in light of the changes in the manufacturing of bleached food-contact
paper products that had occurred.
Given the cooperation that FDA had received from the paper industry, FDA decided that it was appropriate to explore
voluntary avenues for reducing exposure to PCDD's and PCDF's from the use of bleached paper and paperboard. At a meeting
held on November 16, 1990, API advised FDA that 100 percent of the U.S. manufacturers of bleached paper for food-contact
applications were participating in a voluntary program to reduce TCDD levels in all types of food-contact paper products
to 2 ppt or less. In a letter of March 7, 1991, API submitted data to FDA showing that all bleached paper milk cartons manufactured
since July 30, 1990, had residual TCDD levels of 2 ppt or less (Ref. 17). API also informed FDA that 93 percent of bleached
food-contact paper and paperboard met the 2 ppt or less TCDD standard as of December 31, 1991, and that 98 percent of
these products were expected to meet this standard by the end of 1992 (Ref. 18). 
The American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA), formed by the recent merger of API with other forest related associations,
has submitted to FDA the results of an industry-wide survey conducted during the first quarter of 1993 to determine
the degree of compliance with the voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of residual TCDD in bleached food-contact
paper products (Ref. 19). These results show that all of the U.S. manufacturers responding to the survey have implemented
standard operating procedures that result in bleached food-contact paper products that meet the voluntary specification
of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. Out of 249 tests conducted on samples of either bleached pulp, paper, or paperboard, only 3 samples
had detectable levels of TCDD that were above 2 ppt (i.e., 2.1 ppt, 2.2 ppt, and 2.6 ppt). The levels of TCDD that were
found to be above 2 ppt in the survey are likely to be the result of normal variability associated with both the methodology
used to analyze for the TCDD and the manufacturing procedures used to produce the bleached paper products. Moreover,
although the paper industry's voluntary program specifically deals with residual levels of TCDD in bleached food-contact
paper products, industry data have shown that the manufacturing changes that have resulted in the significant reduction
of TCDD in such products also have resulted in a corresponding decrease in TCDF (Ref. 17). 
In 1992, FDA also conducted its own analysis of uncoated bleached paper destined for use in milk cartons (Ref. 20) to
confirm whether it meets the voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. These tests used analytical methodology
developed by FDA's Chicago District Laboratory (Ref. 21). FDA collected samples in late 1991 and early 1992 from five
U.S. manufacturers that produce over 90 percent of the domestic paper stock used for milk cartons. Paper stock from
two of the manufacturers contained very low levels of TCDD (1.4 and 1.5 ppt, respectively) and TCDF (4.0 and 4.7 ppt,
respectively). Residual levels of TCDD and TCDF could not be detected in the paper stock from the other three manufacturers
using an analytical method sensitive to 1 ppt for TCDD and 2 ppt for TCDF. These results support the paper industry's
claim that the bleached paper used to manufacture milk cartons is in compliance with a voluntary specification of
2 ppt for TCDD. 
FDA has also recently completed an analysis of milk samples contained in cartons manufactured using bleached paper
(Ref. 22). Fifteen milk samples were collected in late 1991 and early 1992 from dairies that use bleached paper from
the five major U.S. manufacturers. None of the samples contained detectable levels of TCDD and TCDF using analytical
methodologies with detection limits in the 2 to 10 ppq range. 
In addition, FDA has developed a new risk assessment to determine what the current upper-bound lifetime cancer risk
is from exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached paper and paperboard products meeting
the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. In the absence of migration data for bleached
paper products containing such low levels of TCDD (i.e., 2 ppt or less), FDA assumed that the percent migration of TCDD
from a specific type of food-contact article meeting the voluntary 2 ppt TCDD specification would be similar to the
percent migration observed in earlier studies (Ref. 14). Because the percent migration decreases as the level of
the migrant in the food-contact article decreases, this approach is not likely to underestimate migration levels.
Using the above assumption and assuming that all bleached food-contact paper products contain residual levels of
TCDD low enough to meet a 2 ppt TCDD specification, FDA estimates that the upper-bound daily dietary intake of TCDD
toxic equivalents is no greater than 1.8 pg/person/day (0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day for a 60&hyph;kg
person) (Ref. 23). FDA used this exposure estimate to determine the current upper-bound lifetime cancer risk from
TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached food-contact paper products assuming that virtually all
of such products meet a 2 ppt TCDD specification. 
The carcinogenic unit risk used by FDA in its 1990 risk assessment was based on tumor incidence data from the Kociba
et al. study (Ref. 15). Following FDA's 1990 risk assessment, however, a group of pathologists, called the Pathology
Working Group (PWG), reanalyzed the slides of the liver tumors observed in the 1978 Kociba rat bioassay using the National
Toxicological Program's 1986 classification system for liver tumors (Ref. 24). FDA has reviewed the results of this
reanalysis and agrees with the classification of the tumors made by PWG. Using the results of this revised reading
of the Kociba study slides, FDA estimates a carcinogenic unit risk of 9 x 10

-6

 for an intake of 1 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day. Using this carcinogenic unit risk and an upper-bound daily
dietary exposure estimate of 0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit
of individual lifetime cancer risk from TCDD toxic equivalents would be 3 x 10

-7

 for the use of bleached food-contact paper products meeting a 2 ppt TCDD specification (Ref. 25). 
The agency obtained this 3 x 10

-7

 risk estimate by assuming that the lifetime cancer risk from TCDD would be equal in mammalian species, such as in man
and in rodents when the daily feeding doses are in proportion to body weight raised to the first power (i.e., equivalence
based on feeding dose/body weight/day). This approach is the one that FDA has traditionally used in extrapolating
results of rodent carcinogen bioassays to man. However, in the 

Federal Register

 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24152), EPA, FDA, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission published a draft report proposing
to establish a common default methodology for determining equivalence in carcinogenic unit risks between mammalian
species. If adopted, this unified default approach will be used in those cases where existing agent-specific data
are insufficient to make a case-by-case determination. Based on an analysis of empirical and theoretical aspects
of the cross-species dose-scaling question, the proposed unified default approach assumes that the lifetime cancer
risk from the intake of a carcinogenic substance is equal in different mammalian species when the daily feeding doses
are in proportion to body weight raised to the 3/4 power (i.e., equivalence based on feeding dose/body weight

3/4

/day).
Although this proposed unified default methodology has not been adopted by the three agencies, FDA has used it to calculate
a second estimate of the upper-bound lifetime cancer risk from TCDD exposure if all bleached food-contact paper products
meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for residual levels of TCDD. Using a scaling factor based
on equivalence of pg/kg

3/4

/day to extrapolate the tumor incidence data obtained from the revised reading of the Kociba rodent bioassay slides
to man, FDA estimates a carcinogenic unit risk of 30 x 10

-6

 (pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day)

-1

. Using this carcinogenic unit risk for TCDD and an upper-bound daily dietary exposure estimate of 0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg
body weight/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
would be 9 x 10

-7

 for the use of bleached food-contact paper products meeting a 2 ppt TCDD specification (Ref. 25).
Both of the above upper-bound lifetime risk estimates (3 x 10

-7

 and 9 x 10

-7

), obtained using cross-species scaling factors based on equivalence of pg/kg/day and pg/kg

3/4

/day, respectively, would generally be viewed as very low. However, until the proposed unified default methodology
has been formally adopted, FDA will use the 3 x 10

-7

 risk as the best estimate of what the upper-bound lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents would be when all bleached
food-contact paper products meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for residual levels of TCDD.

On the basis of: (1) FDA's 1990 risk assessment which showed an upper-bound lifetime cancer risk of less than 0.04 in
1 million for each year of exposure based on residual levels of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products
manufactured between 1988 and 1990; (2) the significant progress made by the paper industry in reducing residual
TCDD and TCDF in bleached paper products (AFPA has submitted to FDA the results of an industry wide survey conducted
during the first quarter of 1993 showing that U.S. manufacturers have implemented standard operating procedures
that result in bleached food contact paper products that meet the voluntary specification for 2 ppt or less of TCDD);
and (3) FDA's new risk assessment that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
is 3 x 10

-7

 if all bleached food-contact paper products in fact meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for
residual levels of TCDD, FDA tentatively concludes that the continued use of bleached paper and paperboard in contact
with food is safe during the time that has been, and will be, needed by FDA to complete its evaluation.
FDA will continue to monitor the paper industry's progress in reducing TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached food-contact
paper products manufactured in the United States. The agency will also consider monitoring residual levels of TCDD
and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper and paperboard imported into this country as well as in the bleached paper
and paperboard packaging of imported foods. Information currently available to the agency shows that imported bleached
food-contact paper products comprise only 3 percent of such products used in the United States. 
 Data obtained in a recent human epidemiological study involving workers exposed to low levels of TCDD may also provide
an additional approach to assessing the carcinogenic risk to humans (Ref. 26). FDA plans to review these data and determine
if they are suitable for risk assessment purposes. If suitable, the carcinogenic potency for TCDD in humans obtained
using these data would provide an alternative to the current risk assessment approach which requires the extrapolation
from animal data. FDA will also consider any other data that become available while it completes its review.
The results of FDA's monitoring of the residual levels of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products together
with data and comments received in response to this notice will be used by FDA to determine if any regulatory action
is needed to ensure the safe use of such products. If FDA determines that regulatory action is necessary, one possible
course of action would be to amend the food additive regulations to establish a specification for maximum allowable
levels of residual TCDD and TCDF in food-contact paper products in accordance with section 409 of the act. Using this
approach, bleached paper that is intended for use in food-contact articles, and that is expected to contain TCDD and
TCDF that will migrate into food, would be regarded as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act and be subject
to premarket approval under section 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 348). A substance, such as bleached paper, that has not
been shown to cause cancer, but that contains a carcinogenic impurity such as TCDD, is evaluated under the general
safety clause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from its use (

Scott

 v. 

FDA

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). The risk assessment procedures could be used by FDA to determine the residual level
of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper at which there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from
the use of the bleached paper. FDA would institute rulemaking to amend its food additive regulations to authorize
the food-contact use of bleached paper the contain such levels of TCDD and TCDF. 
A second course of action would be for FDA not to proceed with rulemaking and to take action against TCDD and TCDF in food-contact
paper products on a case-by-case basis. To clarify the levels that would be of concern to FDA, the agency could publish
an action level for residual TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products. FDA relies on action levels to
provide guidance on the level of added poisonous or deleterious substances that may render food adulterated. The
agency has found action levels to be particularly useful in cases, such as the TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached
paper products, where the technology and science associated with an issue continue to change. Although the act is
mute on the use of action levels, court decisions on this regulatory approach (

Community Nutrition Institute

 v. 

Young

, 818 F.2d 943,946 (D.C. Cir. 1987)) have supported their use by FDA as long as it is made clear that such levels are not
legally binding on either industry or the agency. 
FDA requests comments on other possible regulatory approaches that it could use to ensure that any residual amounts
of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products will be safe.

The Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grant Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), HHS.


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds and request for applications. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) announces the availability of funds to support community prevention
coalitions to demonstrate and systematically study approaches to prevent and reduce alcohol, tobacco and other
drug abuse and other drug-related problems through the further development of coalitions and partnerships, at the
State, regional, and/or local level. This will involve the expansion of long-range, comprehensive, multi-disciplinary
community-wide substance abuse prevention programming that reflects the next step in furthering CSAP's mission
to support and promote strengthening of comprehensive prevention systems. The Community Prevention Coalitions
Demonstration (CPCD) Grant Program is authorized under Sections 501(d)(5) and 516 of the Public Health Service Act,
as amended. 



Noting the development and strengthening of community partnership programs across the country, CSAP will support,
under this announcement, grants to promote the progression of this programmatic concept. The new CPCD grant program
will build on the lessons being learned from CSAP's Community Partnership Demonstration Grant Program and similar
programs in the field, e.g., Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's ``Fighting Back'' grants. 

The CSAP model of community-based prevention facilitates the incorporation of substance abuse prevention services
into the general health care system. With health care reform, this approach which emphasizes greater integration
of services, an elimination of duplication, and the need for community self-sufficiency in responding to substance
abuse problems finds particular relevance. 

The conceptual framework of the Community Partnership Program embraces and operationalizes community empowerment,
which is a keystone of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services goals for the Department_empower
communities, emphasize prevention, and value the consumer. 

This notice consists of three parts: 



Part I 

covers information on the legislative authority and the applicable regulations and policies related to the CPCD
grant program. 



Part II 

provides the program description and model and discusses eligibility, availability of funds, period of support
and the receipt date for applications. 



Part III 

describes special requirements of the program, the application process, the review and award criteria and lists
contacts for additional information. 



Part I_Legislative Authority and Other Applicable Regulations and Policies 



Grants awarded under this program announcement are authorized under Sections 501(d)(5) and 516 of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 290aa and 42 U.S.C. 290bb-22). 

Federal regulations at Title 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92, generic requirements concerning the administration of grants,
are applicable to these awards. 

Grants must be administered in accordance with the PHS Grants Policy Statement (Rev. April 1, 1994). 

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number for this program is 93.194. 

Interim progress reports, a final report, and Financial Status Reports (FSRs) will be required and specified to awardees
in accord with PHS Grants Policy requirements.

Healthy People 2000: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention
objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement,
``Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grants,'' is in keeping with objectives in the priority areas
of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and educational and community-based health programs, including objectives
relating to the workplace. 

Applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0; or
Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;01) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone: 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238). 

Non-Use of Tobacco: The medical dangers and high risk of addiction associated with firsthand use of tobacco products
have been thoroughly documented. Moreover, data presented in leading medical journals (for example, New England
Journal of Medicine, June 10, 1993) and reported widely in the press, associate environmental exposure to tobacco
smoke (passive smoking) with increased rates of cancer and other pulmonary diseases among people of all ages and with
increased rates of asthma among children. Further, scientific evidence supports the connection between the use
of smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, and cancer of the mouth, jaw and throat. 

Critical questions now facing public health experts concern the most effective methods for preventing youth from
using tobacco products and for preventing and/or reducing infants' and children's exposure to smoke in both public
and private environments. A combined approach involving public policy, media awareness, and prevention education
strategies appears to be a promising way to address this serious problem; however, careful development, implementation,
and evaluation of specific tobacco use prevention strategies is required to establish their efficacy. 

CSAP recognizes that its target populations are vulnerable to a variety of preventable health and social problems,
including substance abuse. Therefore, CSAP believes that preventative education, policy and media advocacy leading
to environmental and social change concerning use of tobacco products must be a priority for grantees. Further, CSAP
strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free programs and work environments. 



Part II_Program Description and Model, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date 



Program Description: Based on these early indications of the impact of community-wide coalitions, as well as a national
need to develop promising, innovative approaches to drug abuse prevention, CSAP will consider applications that
provide a strategy for testing the effectiveness of the model described below. 

Because of the long term and difficult nature of establishing community partnerships (Altman, Endres, Linzer, 1991;
Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1994; Florin, Mitchell and Stevenson, 1993), and the fact that this is a demonstration
program seeking to understand the potential of partnership programs, successful applicants must be able to document
a fully operational and effective partnership and provide a solid rationale to justify enhancing the nature of its
current partnership efforts, in accord with the provisions of this announcement. 

The new CPCD Grant Program seeks to demonstrate the potential of: (1) Expanding the scope of existing, well-developed
partnerships programmatically and geographically, and/or (2) developing multiple partnerships into coalitions
in their current area to address other drug-related health and social problems. 

The CPCD Program is an important part of CSAP's ongoing, long-term objective to achieve and document measurable reductions
in substance abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related
health problems, mental disorders and comorbidity, crimes, deaths and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within
a community. 

Funds are available to test the effectiveness of extending the original partnership concept through one of two approaches
reflecting the above concepts: (1) Local Prevention Linkages, or (2) State/Regional Coalitions. Applicants must
choose one of these approaches and provide a rationale for their belief that using this approach will significantly
enhance the effectiveness of substance abuse prevention efforts in the area served by the proposed multi-partnership
coalition. Funding will be consistent with the intent of Congress that direct prevention services should be approximately
50 percent of the project budget. 

Program Model: CSAP is seeking applications that demonstrate the effectiveness of the two partnership/coalition
approaches which are described below. 

1. 

Community Partnership-Initiated Approach

_This approach would expand a local community partnership(s) to form a larger coalition comprised of a minimum of
two partnerships (at least one of which is established and one of which is new) to provide integrated, community-based
prevention services across a larger geographical area. At a minimum, this expansion would require the addition of
at least one new community-based partnership. Thus, a community partnership initiated approach would have at least
two (2) partnerships to establish a CPCD coalition. 

Proposed projects must include a rationale for the expansion and document strategies that will enhance substance
abuse prevention programming across the expanded area. This rationale should include identifying and justifying
enhancements in the following: (1) Prevention services (such as peer counseling, pre- and post-natal care, cross-cultural
education programs); (2) successful prevention activities and related services (such as youth alternative programs,
parental support and skills development, mentoring and role modeling by intermediaries, violence related activities);
(3) environmental, social policy and media strategies aimed at alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse prevention;
and (4) a plan and design for coordinating and streamlining prevention efforts that can serve to improve service delivery
and promote cost-effectiveness. 

This approach should demonstrate how to effectively expand and coordinate prevention services across a broader
geographical area that will result in sharing ideas, expanding state-of-the-art practices in diverse disciplines
and fields, and identifying effective substance abuse prevention measures for implementation. 

Applicants must keep in mind that all new services must be community-based and developed at the local level, consistent
with program development approaches that have been documented by CSAP. One of the challenges of the demonstration
is to unify a number of disparate, geographically diverse, community-based programs.

<TEXT>
 



2. State-Coordinated Approach

_This approach would have the same design and purpose as described for the community initiated approach, except that
the State would be the applicant and would serve as the coordinating body in the formation of the broader coalition.
A State-coordinated approach could serve a particular region within the State or encompass the entire State. 

In particular, the State would bring together at least two (2) existing substance abuse prevention partnerships,
allow for a broad array of prevention activities such as those relating to the ones described above, provide for the
addition of at least one new community-based partnership, and establish the requisite coordinating and streamlining
activities. Thus, a State initiated approach would have no fewer than two (2) existing partnerships and one (1) new
partnership in the CPCD coalition. Several States have already made progress in developing regional and State-wide
networks. 

The CSAP substance abuse partnership/coalition model may serve in bridging a variety of broad-based prevention
efforts, including violence and crime reduction, adolescent pregnancy, the spread of sexually transmitted disease,
including HIV/AIDS, and school dropout prevention. It allows existing community-based partnerships and programs
that currently address substance abuse to demonstrate the effectiveness of expanding their base and their efforts
to address related health, social and safety issues through further interaction and linkages with other local coalitions
and partnerships. This type of expansion can have a positive impact on preventing substance abuse through new or stronger
prevention service systems both within the community itself and among affiliated communities. For example, and
to the extent appropriate, partnership substance abuse prevention strategies and services may include the following
areas of concern:

 


_Reducing violence, crime and gang activity related to and/or aggravated by alcohol and other drug problems. 

_Reducing/preventing the spread of sexually transmitted disease, including HIV/AIDS, with respect to alcohol
and other drug use and abuse. 

_Addressing the special needs of rural, wilderness, and frontier communities with alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
problems. 

_Addressing special needs in areas with high rates of immigration, poverty, disaster, and unemployment_aggravated
by alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems. 

_Reducing substance abuse and related problems in the workforce_including collaborative labor/management efforts.

 


This program encourages that approximately 50 percent of Federal funds be used for the provision of prevention services
and approximately 15&hyph;25 percent for evaluation. 

Because the CPCD Program provides the opportunity for community resources such as local coalitions, partnerships,
service providers, and programs to formally collaborate, applicants are required to include a description of agreements,
commitments and processes to be used in developing and implementing the proposed project. (This documentation must
be provided in Appendix 4 of the application entitled, ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.)


Existing partnerships are expected to have conducted needs assessments and are to use their needs assessment to:
determine gaps in prevention services; identify any inefficiencies in the delivery of these services; and to begin
work towards changing formerly established priorities to meet current needs. All new services proposed must be supported
by the needs assessment. 

Proposed projects submitted under this announcement must present a five (5) year comprehensive substance abuse
prevention plan to demonstrate and study the development, implementation, and effectiveness of their design. The
applicant's initial plan should include a discussion of all preliminary goals, objectives, and activities. These
may be refined as appropriate, as the program evolves and progresses. 

Evaluation must be an essential part of the plan for assessing the impact of the changes and services on the substance
abuse-related problems in the community. Details are provided in the section on Evaluation. 

Eligibility: Applications may be submitted by public agencies, such as State, local and tribal governments, or local
private (non-profit) organizations/agencies (i.e., existing partnerships, universities). In all cases, the
applicant must be designated to act on behalf of the larger evolving coalition of multiple partnerships proposed
in the CPCD grant application. 

Because the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grant Program is intended to build on the work of already
existing prevention partnerships, by expanding both the base and the service capabilities of these partnerships
into broader-based coalitions, this announcement requires that applicants be part of established community partnerships.


The applicant organization must be a member of the coalition (to be developed) and be supported by its (the proposed
coalition) membership in receiving an award under this program activity. This agreement must be documented through
a letter of support from each member of the proposed coalition. (These letters must be provided in Appendix 4 of the
application entitled ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.) 

CSAP strongly encourages applications from tribal governments, Native American/Alaskan Native partnerships
or Indian Nations. Such applicants must already be existing partnerships. 

Previous or current CSAP Community Partnership Demonstration Program grantees are eligible to apply for a new grant
under this announcement. Currently funded CSAP Community Partnership grantees must demonstrate their ability
to fulfill the requirements of their current grant in addition to taking on the expanded tasks and responsibilities
of the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Program. 

CSAP Community Partnership grantees will not be permitted to use Community Partnership project staff for full-time
positions in a new CPCD project; nor will they be permitted to reduce the level of effort on the current Community Partnership
project as a result of obtaining a grant award under this new program.

Applicants must state how an existing partnership will work with the proposed coalition. If not the applicant agency,
collaboration and involvement with State and local governments will be required. 

Other active partnerships receiving funding from private groups such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, United
Way organizations, or other business organizations that have formed a non-profit entity, may also apply. 

Applicants receiving Federal funds from other agencies such as the Department of Education or the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention may also apply, but must identify the source of funding and purpose of their current grant.


Availability of Funds: It is estimated that approximately $9 million will be available to support approximately
9&hyph;12 awards under this program announcement in Fiscal Year 1994. Average grants will be in the $500,000 range.
However, funding levels will depend on the availability of appropriated funds. 

Period of Support: Support may be requested for a period of up to five (5) years. Annual awards will be made subject to
continued availability of funds and progress achieved. 

Application Receipt and Review Schedule: Applications will be received and reviewed according to the following
schedule:

Subject to the availability of funds in future years, CSAP may reissue this announcement and publish future receipt
dates and a notice of availability of funds in the 

Federal Register

. Because the President's 1995 budget request proposes to consolidate SAMHSA's categorical substance abuse prevention
demonstrations, certain aspects of this program could change. Therefore, applicants are strongly encouraged to
verify the availability and terms of funding for new awards for this program. 

Consequences of Late Submission: Applications must be received by the above receipt date to be accepted for review.
An application received after the deadline may be acceptable if it carries a legible proof-of-mailing date (assigned
by the carrier) and that date is not later than one week prior to the deadline date. However, private metered postmarks
are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing.

Part III_Special Requirements, Review/Award Criteria and Contacts for Additional Information



Evaluation Plan: This CPCD Program requires more rigor in the conceptualization, design and implementation of projects
and in their evaluation than the previous Community Partnership Program. The goal is to achieve and document measurable
reductions in alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol
and other drug related health problems, violence, deaths, and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within a community
or regional area. Applications submitted under this announcement must present a multi-year comprehensive substance
abuse prevention plan for systems change at the community or geographic area level through the design and implementation
of one of the two approaches discussed in the Program Model section of this announcement. The application must contain
an evaluation plan which will enable the grantee to assess the effect of the prevention program on a variety of indicators,
as described in the remainder of this section.

The ultimate goal of this program is to demonstrate significant reductions in substance abuse. The broad outcomes
expected include:

1. A measurable and sustained reduction in initiation of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use among children and adolescents.

2. A reduction in alcohol, tobacco and other drug related deaths and injuries especially among children, adolescents
and young adults.

3. A decline in the prevalence of health problems related to and exacerbated by alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.

4. A reduction in on the job problems and injuries related to substance abuse.

5. A reduction in substance abuse related crime.

CSAP will support only applicant projects that have a well developed and comprehensive evaluation plan. The evaluation
plan must be conceptually and procedurally integrated with the overall project, and must have both an outcome evaluation
component and a process evaluation component.

Since the purpose for this program is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse and related health
and safety problems in the targeted area, instruments should be used which will provide periodic measures of these
indicators. In addition to measures of incidence and prevalence related to substance abuse and related health and
safety problems, grantees will be required to collect data on the seven (7) items listed in the Community Wide Indicators
of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse included in the Application Kit. Applicants must specify the means to be used to collect
these data. Grantees will be required to collect baseline data, yearly progress report data, and end of project data,
and may be required to collect follow-up data on all indices. Grantees will be required to submit all reports and results
in both hard copy and in electronic media formats.

The evaluation plan must present a sound methodology for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation
of data. The evaluation plan must utilize psychometrically sound measures and instruments for data collection.
Applicants must describe the selection of instruments to be used and must provide information about their normative
properties, including the appropriateness of their use for the culture(s) under study. The presented evaluation
methods, measures and instruments must be sensitive and relevant to the target groups of the community with respect
to age and gender distribution, reading level, and culture. The evaluation plan must also present a time-line for
carrying out all evaluation procedures.

The evaluation plan must be designed and carried out by a professional who is highly experienced in comparative evaluation
methodology, independent of the project, and able to work closely with the grantee.

Fifteen to 25 percent of the funds available are to be used for the evaluation component. 

Outcome Evaluation: Outcome evaluation assesses whether the project was effective in achieving its goals, objectives
and activities. For the purposes of this grant program, the outcome evaluation must provide periodic measures on
the community or geographic area in the following broad categorical areas: 

(1) Substance abuse prevalence, incidence, frequency and amount; 

(2) Substance abuse-related health, safety and risk indicators (e.g., HIV/AIDS, crime, violence, unemployment,
etc). 

The outcome evaluation design should employ a time series design, which allows for comparisons within and between
communities or geographic areas. 

Outcome Evaluation Questions: At a minimum, applicants should include the following questions in the outcome evaluation
component: 

(1) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable reductions in use/abuse of identified
substances, and/or health and safety problems of the target groups in the community or geographic area? 

(2) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable increases in knowledge and anti-substance
abuse attitudes by residents of the community or geographic area? 

(3) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable increases in the target group(s)'
ability to resist substance abuse and related risky behaviors? 

(4) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable decreases in the target group's
school absences or truancy rates in the community or geographic area? 

(5) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a perceived increase in safety and a measurable
decrease in drug dealing in the community or geographic area neighborhoods? 

(6) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable decreases in the rate of domestic
violence in the community or geographic area? 

(7) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of violent
crimes associated with substance abuse in the community or geographic area? 

(8) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of substance
abuse related emergency room admissions? 

(9) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of substance
abuse related vehicle crashes? 

(10) Does the presence of the Coalition result in measurable increases in environmental/social change policies
(i.e., number of ordinances introduced/enacted/repealed; limited alcohol and tobacco advertising, etc.). 

Grantees will be required to collect uniform baseline and yearly data on some indicators using standardized instruments.
Data collection and analysis, aggregation to group, and procedures for transmitting the results to CSAP will be provided
at the first grantee meeting following award. OMB approval will be obtained for use of the instruments.

Process Evaluation: Process evaluation is both a quantitative and qualitative description of a project. It documents
the evolution of the project from inception through implementation and completion. The process evaluation documents
what was actually done, what was learned, what barriers inhibited implementation, how such barriers were resolved,
and what should be done differently in 
future projects. In short, process evaluation allows for successful projects to be replicated. 
For the purposes of this grant, program process evaluation should: 
(1) Document and describe the processes by which the coalition is expanded, refocused, implemented and operated;
and 
(2) Identify factors associated with effective planning and implementation of the prevention strategies for the
community or geographic area. 
Comparison Community or Area: Use of comparison communities or geographic areas which closely resemble the community
or area served by the coalition is an excellent way to provide a rigorous test of the effectiveness of the interventions
to be implemented under this announcement. CSAP realizes that finding suitable comparison communities may be difficult
because of the increasing popularity of the partnership movement, and considerable effort may be needed to identify
a similar community willing to participate in the full evaluation process. 
Comparison and target communities/areas should be as similar as possible at baseline, because the greater the similarity
between the target and comparison communities/areas, the greater the likelihood of detecting and explaining effects
of the coalition prevention program on the target community/area. The comparison communities/areas should not
have a prevention program similar to the one intended for the target community/area. The target and comparison communities/areas
should be geographically distant enough to prevent the transmission of program activities from the target to the
comparison communities/areas. 
CSAP realizes the difficulties applicants may have in identifying comparison communities or areas. CSAP is also
aware of the limitations of this approach given the variation and potential for contamination of prevention programs
across communities, regions or States. Despite these limitations, applicants are encouraged to use this approach.
However, applicants will not be adversely affected by using a different evaluation approach that will yield scientifically
credible data. 

Participation in National Cross-Site Evaluation: A National cross-site evaluation project will be conducted with
the goals of identifying: (1) Successful and innovative community-based Coalition models; (2) effective strategies
for the prevention of substance abuse, related health and safety problems and risk factors; (3) common inhibitors
to forming effective Coalitions: (4) common inhibitors to design and implementation of effective prevention strategies;
(5) Coalition models that effectively prepare the service infrastructure of communities for the eventual implementation
of Health Care Reform; and (6) Coalition models and prevention strategies that produce the most benefits for the lowest
monetary costs. 
Projects funded under this announcement will be required to participate in the National cross-site evaluation,
by contributing data that are comparable across projects. A detailed description of the National Cross-site Evaluation
Plan will be communicated to the funded projects at the beginning of the grant program. 
Although participation in the National Evaluation project is mandatory, grantees will not have to expend grant funds
for activities that are not already within the local-level evaluation plans. Selected grantees will be technically
and financially supported by the National Cross-site Evaluation project for activities that are not within the purview
of their local-level projects. 
Coordination with Other Federal/Non-Federal Programs: Applicants seeking support under this announcement are
encouraged to coordinate with other Federal, State, and local public and private programs serving their target population.
Program coordination helps to better serve the multiple needs of the client population, to maximize the impact of
available resources, and to prevent duplication of services. Funding priority will be given to applicants who demonstrate
a coordinated approach to providing comprehensive substance abuse prevention services (see Award Criteria). 
Single State Agency Coordination: Coordination and collaboration with the Single State Agency (SSA) for alcohol
and other drug abuse is encouraged to ensure communication, reduce duplication, and facilitate continuity. The
application must include a copy of a letter sent to the SSA that briefly describes the proposed project. A copy of this
letter should be included in Appendix B to the application entitled ``Letters to/from SSAs.'' 
A list of SSAs can be found in the grant application kit. If the target population falls within the jurisdiction of more
than one State, all representative SSAs should be involved. Evidence of support for the proposed project from the
SSA and from the State Public Health Agency will be considered in making funding decisions (See ``Award Decision Criteria''
section). 
Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372): Applications submitted in response to this announcement are subject to
the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at
45 CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of applications for Federal financial
assistance. Applicants (other than Federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact the State's
Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application and to receive any
necessary instructions on the State's review process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant
is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit.
The SPOC should send any State process recommendations to the following address at CSAP (

not 

the address to which the application was mailed): 
Office of Review, Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Rockwall II Building, Suite 630, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD 20857, Attn: SPOC/CPCD Grants. 
The due date for the State review process recommendations is 

no later than 60 days

 after the deadline date for the receipt of applications. CSAP does not guarantee to accommodate or explain SPOC comments
that are received after the 60-day cutoff.

The exchange is being proposed by Olympic Land Corporation. The purpose of the exchange is to acquire non-federal
lands located along the Virgin River, within the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and within the Toiyabe
and Inyo National Forests. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau's planning for the lands involved and has been
discussed with local governmental officials. The public interest will be served by making the exchange. The value
of the lands will be determined by an appraisal. If the exchange values are not equal, the transaction will be phased
or the acreage adjusted or money will be used to equalize the values upon approval of the final appraisal of both the
offered and selected lands. The selected lands were identified in a Notice of Realty Action published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47472) on September 9, 1993.


For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, interested parties may submit comments concerning the offered lands to the District Manager, Las Vegas District,
P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126. Any adverse comments will be reviewed by the State Director.

<DOCTITLE>Gary Marina, Supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Park Service, Interior.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Availability of supplement to the draft environmental impact statement for the Gary Marina, adjacent to Indiana
Dunes National Lakeshore.

 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces
the availability of a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the Gary Marina. The city
of Gary proposes to construct a marina on Lake Michigan adjacent to the west boundary of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
The proposed marina would require an access road through Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The supplement to the
DEIS was prepared by the city of Gary and the NPS. 



The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for marina access is identified in the supplement to the DEIS as
the ``proposed'' access alternative; construction of an access road on the abandoned Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad
bed, within the west end of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and on U.S. Steel Corporation property, adjacent to,
but outside, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. This is a new alternative that was not previously described in the
DEIS of April 1989. The new alternative was developed in response to public and agency comment on the DEIS. Many comments
called for the development of an access alternative with less impact to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore than those
presented in the DEIS. 

The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for the marina location is identified in the DEIS as Site 1, which
is behind an existing breakwater on land currently owned by U.S. Steel Corporation. All other marina site alternatives
described in the DEIS have been eliminated from further consideration. 

Comments on the Supplement to the DEIS should be received no later than June 7, 1994. 

Comments on the supplement to the DEIS should be submitted to: Mr. Dale Engquist, Superintendent, Indiana Dunes National
Lakeshore, 1100 N. Mineral Springs Road, Porter, Indiana 46304, (219) 926&hyph;7561 

Public reading copies of the supplement to the DEIS and the 1989 DEIS, will be available for review at the following
locations:

 


Office of Public Affairs, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington,
DC 20240, (202) 343&hyph;6843 

Headquarters and Visitor Center (corner of Hwy 12 and Kemil Road), 
Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, 1100 N. Mineral Springs Road, Porter, Indiana 46304, (219) 926&hyph;7561 

City Hall, City of Gary, 401 Broadway, Gary, Indiana 46402, (219) 881&hyph;1332 

Gary Public Library, City of Gary, 220 West 5th Avenue, Gary, Indiana, 46402, (219) 886&hyph;2484

 


A limited number of the supplement to the DEIS and the 1989 DEIS are available on request from the Superintendent, Indiana
Dunes National Lakeshore (refer to address above).

(4) 

Interest Rate: 

Alternatives of fixed and variable rates are requested.

(a) 

Fixed Interest Rate: 

If rates are to be quoted based on a spread over an index, the lender should use as its index a long bond, specifically
the 61/4% U.S. Treasury Bond due August 15, 2023. Such rate is to be set at the time of acceptance.

(b)

To be based on the six-month British Bankers Association LIBOR, preferably with terms relating to Borrower's right
to convert to fixed. The rate should be adjusted weekly.

(5) 

Prepayment: 



(a) Offers should include any options for prepayment and mention prepayment premiums, if any.

(b) Only in an extraordinary event to assure compliance with statutes binding USAID, USAID reserves that right to
accelerate the loan (it should be noted that since the inception of the USAID Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID
has not exercised its right of acceleration). 

(6) 

Fees: 

Offers should specify the placement fees and other expenses, including USAID fees and Paying and Transfer Agent fees.
Lenders are requested to include all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses in their placement fee. Such fees and expenses
shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. All fees should be clearly specified in the offer.

(7) 

Closing Date:

 Not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender.

Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion
of the borrower, and thereafter, subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements
between USAID and the Borrower.

The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, as amended (the ``Act'').

Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in section 238(c) of the Act. They are: (1) U.S.
citizens; (2) domestic U.S. corporations, partnerships, or associations substantially beneficially owned by
U.S. citizens; (3) foreign corporations whose share capital is at least 95 percent owned by U.S. citizens; and, (4)
foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens.

To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of
the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established
from time to time by USAID. 

Information as to the eligibility of investors and other aspects of the USAID housing guaranty program can be obtained
from: Mr. Peter M. Kimm, Director, Office of Housing and Urban Programs, U.S. Agency for International Development,
room 401, SA&hyph;2, Washington, DC 20523&hyph;0214.

to submit in its verified statement/comments the following supplemental information: 
1. Pro forma income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements for each of the first 3 years after the proposed
acquisition of the line, as additional support to demonstrate its financial fitness. The data in these statements
should be fully explained and supported. The pro forma income statements should reflect net income rather than operating
income. 
2. Details of any borrowing or other financing arrangements that have been made for CALM's purchase and operation
of the line, including the specific sources of funds CALM will use and what the sources will commit. 
3. Details of any planned track improvements, including estimated costs. 4. The estimated land value and sources
of unit costs for the net liquidation value (NLV) estimate of the line.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Co., et. al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3, Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>




<RINDOCK>[Docket Nos. 50&hyph;528, 50&hyph;529, and 50&hyph;530]</RINDOCK>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company, et. al., (the
licensee), for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Wintersburg, Arizona.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



By letter dated October 26, 1993, the licensee proposed to change technical specifications (TS) to allow an increase
in fuel enrichment (Uranium 235) to a maximum of 4.30 weight percent.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed changes to the TS are required in order to provide the licensee with operational flexibility to use fuel
enriched with U&hyph;235 up to 4.30 weight percent at PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3. The present TS permit a maximum of 4.05
weight percent U&hyph;235. Thus the change to the TS was requested.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and concludes that storage and use of
fuel enriched with U&hyph;235 up to 4.30 weight percent at PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3 is acceptable. The safety considerations
associated with higher enrichments have been evaluated by the NRC staff and the staff has concluded that such changes
would not adversely affect plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverse effect on the probability of any accident.
There will be no change to authorized power level. There was no change requested to current 52,000 MWD/MTU burnup.
The change in fuel enrichment is bounded by NRC staff generic review (discussed below). As a result, there is no significant
increase in individual or cumulative radiation exposure.

The environmental impacts of transportation resulting from the use of higher enrichment and extended irradiation
are discussed in the staff assessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Transportation
Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation.'' This assessment was published in the 

Federal Register 

on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) as corrected on August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32322) in connection with the Shearon Harris Nuclear
Power Plant, Unit 1: Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact. As indicated therein, the environmental
cost contribution of an increase in fuel enrichment of up to 5 weight percent U&hyph;235 and irradiation limits of
up to 60,000 MWD/MTU are either unchanged, or may in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S&hyph;4 as set forth
in 10 CFR 51.52(c). These findings are applicable to the proposed amendments for PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes involve systems located within the restricted
area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental
impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed amendments.

The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination,
and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the 

Federal Register 

on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2860). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. The staff considered denial of the proposed
action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3, dated February 1982 (NUREG 0841).



Agencies and Persons Consulted 



The staff consulted the State of Arizona official regarding environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments.

For further details with respect to this action, see the license's application for amendment dated October 26, 1993,
which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Co., et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company, (the licensee),
for operation of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Wintersburg, Arizona.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications (TS) related to increasing the pressurizer
safety valve (PSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +3 percent and ^1 percent, increasing the main steam safety
valve (MSSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +/^3 percent, reducing the high pressurizer pressure trip setpoint
(HPPT) response time from 1.15 seconds to 0.5 second, and reducing the Technical Specifications minimum auxiliary
feedwater (AFW) pump flow requirement from 750 gallons per minute (GPM) to 650 GPM.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated November 13, 1990, as supplemented
by letters of additional information dated May 27, 1992, May 13, 1993, and November 12, 1993.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed changes to the TS are required in order to provide the licensee with operational flexibility in meeting
surveillance requirements for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) flow, and pressurizer safety valve (PSV) and main steam
safety valve (MSSV) lift setpoint tolerances. The proposed change to the TS also involves a reduction of the high pressurizer
pressure trip (HPPT) response time. This reduction is necessary to ensure that the peak pressures during postulated
accident scenarios for the other changes (AWF, PSV, and MSSV) do not violate safety limits.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and the licensee's assessment of increased
radiological release as a result of the safety valve setpoint tolerance change and the proposed reduction in auxiliary
feedwater flow. For the most limiting SGTR scenario, this results in an increase in the 2-hour thyroid dose from 200
rem to less than 248 rem. Adding the increased dose due to the expanded PSV and MSSV setpoint tolerances (which the licensee
calculated as a 5-percent dose increase), results in a 2-hour dose of 260 rem. This value provides adequate margin
to the 10 CFR part 100 guideline of 300 rem. The licensee also evaluated radiological release for the reactor coolant
pump (RCP) shaft seizure event, and determined that the calculated 0.5 rem increase was insignificant compared to
the 246 rem dose reported in Supplement 2 to the staff's Safety Evaluation Report related to the Combustion Engineering
Standard Safety Analyses Report (CESSAR) for System 80, and the 300 rem SRP acceptance criteria. The staff finds the
analysis results, utilizing proper conservatisms, to be within 10 CFR guidelines.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no
changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase
in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological plant effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.

The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was
published in the 

Federal Register 

on December 27, 1990 (55 FR 53220). Two petitions for leave to intervene and request for hearing were filed following
this Notice. One request was denied and the other granted. However, the party that was granted the hearing later voluntarily
withdrew their contention.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3, dated February 1982 (NUREG 0841).



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted the State of Arizona official regarding environmental impact of the proposed action. The State
official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for amendment dated November 13,
1990, and supplemented by letters of additional information dated May 27, 1992, May 13, 1993, and November 12, 1993,
which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004.

<DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc., System Energy Resources, Inc., South Mississippi Electric Power Association, Mississippi
Power and Light Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;29, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station, Unit 1, located in Claiborne County, Louisiana. 

The proposed amendment, requested by the licensee by letter of October 15, 1993, would represent a full conversion
from the current Technical Specifications (TS) to a set of TS based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR/6 Technical
Specifications,'' Revision O, September 1992. NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed
of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative
to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final
NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1 Technical
Specifications utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening
Criteria Application and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434. 

The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized
as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes. 

Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting,
renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes
to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed
mitigation of accident or transient events. 

Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components
or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria
to the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to
be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and
surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively
controlled documents. Changes to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected
structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are subject
to 10 CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS. These
proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. 

More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more
stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident
or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems
and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis. 

Changes characterized as less restrictive have been subdivided into four additional subcategories. They include:


a. 

Relocating details to TS Bases, the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), or procedures. 

The requirements to be transposed from the TS to the Bases, USAR or procedures are the same as those currently included
in the existing TS. The TS Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information are subject to 10 CFR 50.59
and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. 

b. 

Extension of instrumentation surveillance test intervals (STIs) and allowed outage times (AOTs). 

The proposed changes affect only the STIs and AOTs and will not impact the function of monitoring system variables
over the anticipated ranges for normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences, or accident conditions.
However, the changes are expected to reduce the test related plant scrams and test induced wear on the equipment. General
Electric Topical Reports GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;1 and GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;2 showed that the effects
of these extensions of STIs and AOTs, which produced negligible impact, are bounded by previous analyses. Further,
the NRC has reviewed these reports and approved the conclusions on a generic basis. 

c. 

Relocation of instrumentation only requirements (which provide no post-accident function). 

These requirements are part of the routine operational monitoring and are not considered in the safety analysis.
Changes made to the Bases, USAR, and procedures containing the relocated information will be made in accordance with
10 CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. These
proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. 

d. 

Other less restrictive changes. 

Additional changes that result in less restrictions in the TS are discussed individually in the licensee's submittal.


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By May 12, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714,
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Judge George W. Armstrong Library, Post Office Box 1406,
S. Commerce at Washington, Natchez, Mississippi 39120. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene
is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or
by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary
or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William D. Beckner, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;1: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Winston &amp; Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., 12th Floor, Washington,
DC 20005&hyph;3502, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer, or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards considerations in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated October 15, 1993, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room, located at the Judge George W. Armstrong Library, Post
Office Box 1406, S. Commerce at Washington, Natchez, Mississippi 39120.

<DOCTITLE>Houston Lighting and Power Company (South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



On March 22, 1988, and March 28, 1989, the Commission issued Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;76 and NPF&hyph;80
to Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company, et al. (the licensee) for South Texas Project, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively.
The license provided, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the
Commission.



II



Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``each licensee shall successfully complete a requalification program developed
by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission. The program shall be conducted for a continuous
period not to exceed 24 months in duration.'' Also, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(c)(1), ``The requalification program
must be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed two years, and upon conclusion must be promptly followed, pursuant
to a continuous schedule, by successive requalification programs.''

By letter dated December 17, 1993, as supplemented by letter dated January 14, 1994, the licensee requested a one-time
exemption from 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1) which would extend the current requalification cycle to April 22, 1994.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative,
grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law
and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.''



III



HL&amp;P increased the operating staff from five to six crews to reduce the burden placed on the operating staff. The
increase to six crews is in the public interest in that it will allow sufficient numbers of operating personnel to maintain
individual workloads at a reasonable level while on shift without the need for routine overtime and still allow for
continued uninterrupted training. The licensee began its six-operating crew, six-week requalification training
plan in January 1994. Because of the additional crew, the current requalification cycle, which began on April 13,
1992, will continue until April 22, 1994. The extension of the training cycle is unavoidable in order to enhance the
operations staff while maintaining adequate staffing levels. The exemption will allow the licensee to exceed the
24-month limit stated in 10 CFR 55.59 by ten days.



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property, and is otherwise in the public interest.

Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1).

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of the Exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 11330).

This Exemption is effective on issuance.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 4th day of April 1994.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Foreign Listing Standards


April 5, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 23, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange is proposing to amend Section 110 of the 

Company Guide

 to allow non-U.S. issuers to provide their U.S. shareholders with summary annual reports under certain circumstances.
The following is the text of the proposed rule change, with italics representing the language to be added:
Section 110. Securities of Foreign Companies *&blank;*&blank;* 



(d) Disclosure_The Exchange will require the company to: (i) furnish to American shareholders an English language
version of its annual financial statements and all other materials regularly provided to other shareholders, and
(ii) publish, at least semi-annually, an English language version of its interim financial statements. 

In addition, the Exchange will permit non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices regarding the distribution
of annual reports to shareholders, if, at a minimum, shareholders (i) are provided at least summary annual reports
and (ii) have the ability, upon request, to receive a complete annual report, and the financial information contained
in the summary annual report is reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to the extent that such
reconciliation would be required in the full annual report.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the propose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


In 1990 the U.K. Companies Act was amended to permit issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide holders
of their ordinary shares with an option to receive either a full annual report or a summary annual report. The U.K. Companies
Act sets forth the specific financial and management information that must be contained in the summary reports, and
requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity, at any time, to obtain the
full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually of this right and how the
report might be obtained. When the amendments first became effective, shareholders received both reports and notice
of the available option with respect to future reports.
The purpose of the amendments was to provide: (1) Potential cost savings to issuers, and (2) a more easily read document
to retail holders. A majority of U.K. shareholders now receive the summary reports, and the amendments are viewed
as successful.
Certain U.K. issuers would now like to provide U.S. holders of listed ADRs with summary reports in place of full annual
reports if the holders do not object. The Commission recently approved a New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') rule change
which allows non-U.S. issuers which are NYSE-listed to mail summary annual reports to U.S. share/ADR holders in lieu
of the full annual report, if permitted by home country practice.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
See

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33661, International Series Release No. 637 (February 23, 1994), 59 FR 10028
(March 2, 1994).
</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange is proposing to similarly amend Section 110 of the Exchange's 

Company Guide,

 which is comparable to the NYSE provision described above. Section 110 currently allows the Exchange to consider
the laws, customs and practices of the country where a non-U.S. issuer is domiciled in evaluating the listing eligibility
of a company whose corporate structure or practices are inconsistent with specified rules which apply to domestic
companies, but requires that a full annual report be provided to all U.S. share/ADR holders.
Under the proposed amendment, a U.S. holder would initially receive both reports and then be provided with an ongoing
option to receive either report.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The summary report would set forth such financial and other information as is required by home country law and would
be required to include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the same extent as would be required in the full annual report.
The change would have no impact on the issuer's existing annual and semi-annual SEC reporting obligations.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
2

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission notes that, although the U.K. Companies Act requires that shareholders initially receive both reports,
the language of the proposed Amex rule permits non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices, which may not contain
this requirement.

</FOOTNOTE>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940412-2-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940412-2-00112 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed amendment is consistent with the Exchange's existing policies with respect to non-U.S. companies,
which permits such companies to follow home country practice in such areas as interim reporting and corporate governance.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating
transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.


B. 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-04
and should be submitted by [insert date 21 days from date of publication].

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving and Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval to Amendment to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Restrictions in the Intraday Payment of Principal and Interest
</DOCTITLE>



April 4, 1994.



On November 12, 1993, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;05) pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 amending PTC's rules regarding intraday payments of principal and interest (``P&amp;I''). Notice of the proposal
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on January 20, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On February 14, 1994, PTC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 requesting permanent approval of its pilot program of intraday payment of collected and available P&amp;I.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change set forth in the notice. For the reasons discussed below, the
Commission is approving the proposed rule change.

</FOOTNAME>
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33132 (November 2, 1993), 58 FR 59501. 

</FOOTNOTE>


I. Description 



The proposal would establish, on a permanent basis, PTC's authority to offer participants the opportunity to receive,
on an intraday basis, payment of principal and interest PTC has received on their behalf. PTC first offered this service
on a pilot basis in November 1993.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In addition to making this service permanent, the proposal would codify the requirement that intraday distribution
of P&amp;I shall be made only from P&amp;I payments collected and in immediately available funds at such time, without
recourse to borrowed funds or to alternate sources of funds. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
5

</FOOTNAME>


Id.



</FOOTNOTE>


Under this service, participants are able to receive 50% of the P&amp;I payments made with respect to GNMA I securities
by means of an intraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds at approximately 12 noon on the distribution
date, with the balance distributed by means of a credit to such participants at end-of-day.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Before November 1993, PTC's rules and procedures provided that PTC disburse P&amp;I on securities deposited at PTC
by means of a credit to a participant's applicable account cash balance. As a result, a participant would receive available
funds in the amount of the P&amp;I, net of any account debits and/or credits, at the end of the day as part of the settlement
payment process. 




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
6

</FOOTNAME>


Id.

 These percentages, and the ability of participants to select the method of payment, may change upon future Commission
approval, taking into account P&amp;I collection and disbursement experience, the impact on PTC's settlement cycle
of intraday disbursement of P&amp;I by Fedwire transfer, and participant response to the pilot program. 

On November 16, 1993, PTC implemented its early P&amp;I pilot program. A total of 44 participants chose to receive
the early cash disbursement of 50% of their P&amp;I allotment, while 10 chose to receive their total allotment at net
settlement. Letter from John J. Sceppa, President and Chief Executive Officer, PTC, to Judith Poppalardo, Assistant
Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 23, 1993). Each month since then, PTC has affected
a successful intraday distributions of P&amp;I. Letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President, General Counsel
and Secretary, PTC, to Francois Mazur, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (March 17, 1994).


</FOOTNOTE>


II. Discussion



The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and, specifically,
with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Those sections require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
7

</FOOTNAME>
15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(A) &amp; (F).

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission believes that PTC's proposal will allow participants to get P&amp;I funds faster consistent with
systemic concerns. Limiting intra-day payments to immediately available funds held by PTC will ensure that PTC's
other funds are available if required to achieve end-of-day settlement.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
8

Such funds include, but are not limited to, PTC's own funds, funds obtained from PTC's uncommitted P&amp;I line of
credit, as well as other borrowings which may be used to fund P&amp;I distribution when affected as part of the end-of-day
settlement.

Participants are limited to receiving up to 50% of their P&amp;I allotment disbursement early. Any increase in percentage
would require that PTC file a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act.

The Commission believes good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 requires that the Commission grant PTC permanent approval of its pilot program for intraday P&amp;I payments.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Because PTC's proposal incorporates into its rules the requirement that intraday disbursement of P&amp;I be limited
to the amount of P&amp;I collected and available, PTC has fulfilled the Commission's requirement for permanent approval
of the pilot program. In addition, the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors'')
has stated that it believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the safeguarding of securities and funds
in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, and therefore agrees with the accelerated
approval.

to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's

It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 that PTC's proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;05), as amended, be, and hereby is, approved.

Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On April
8, 1986, applicant (then known as ValueGuard Stock Fund, Inc.) filed a notification of registration pursuant to section
8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became
effective on August 6, 1986, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that same date.

2. On June 25, 1992, shareholders of the Timed Equity Asset Management Fund series (``TEAM Fund'') of applicant redeemed
all their TEAM Fund shares at the net asset value per share determined on that date, in exchange for which TEAM Fund distributed
all of its assets totalling $409.86.

3. On June 18, 1992, and again on October 26, 1992, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization
whereby applicant agreed to transfer all of the assets of its Ray Equity/Income Trust series (``Ray Fund'') to the
Capstone Fund of the Southwest series (the ``Acquiring Fund'') of Capstone Series, Inc., in exchange for shares of
the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all identified liabilities of Ray Fund. In accordance
with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring
Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would
not be diluted as a result.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other because certain of applicant's
directors and officers also serve as directors and/or officers of the Acquiring Fund. Although purchases and sales
between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption
for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason
of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.
</FOOTNOTE>


4. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the low asset size
and consequent high expense ratios of Ray Fund (b) limited investment flexibility due to Ray Fund's small asset size,
(c) the compatibility of applicant's investment objectives and practices with those of the Acquiring Fund, (d) the
potential of enhanced investment performance, greater flexibility, and increased stability due to larger asset
size, and (e) economies of scale to be realized primarily with respect to fixed expenses.

5. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders
on or about September 24, 1992. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the SEC. Applicant's
shareholders approved the reorganization, in accordance with Maryland law, at a special meeting held on October
30, 1992.

6. As of November 2, 1992 (the ``Closing Date'') applicant had 310,577 shares of common stock outstanding with an aggregate
net asset value of $2,047,664, and a per share net asset value of $6.59. On the Closing Date, applicant transferred
all of the assets of the Ray Fund to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset
value equal to the value of the assets of the Ray Fund, less any liabilities transferred. The shares received in exchange
for applicant's assets were distributed to applicant's shareholders on a 

pro rata 

basis.

7. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative
expenses totalling approximately $23,000. These expenses were borne by applicant, CAMCO, and the Acquiring Fund,
with applicant's share of the expenses totalling approximately $6,000.

8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

Notice of opinion and final order.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Transportation, by Order 94&hyph;4&hyph;8 in Docket 48780, has rejected the application of ATX,
Inc. to operate as an air carrier, citing the strong influence that Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas
Air Corp., would have on the company. In the final decision, the Department found that the record fails to demonstrate
that Lorenzo has a sufficient commitment to safety or to comply with legal requirements. Both Eastern Air Lines and
Continental Airlines, while they were owned by Texas Air Corp. and controlled by Lorenzo, experienced operational,
maintenance, and labor-related problems that were among the most serious in the history of U.S. aviation. These problems
threatened safety to the point that the Federal government had to intervene to ensure the public's protection. While
ATX has adequate financing and meets the citizenship requirements, managerial competence and compliance disposition
are lacking and thus ATX fails to meet the department's airline fitness standards.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Debt Management Advisory Committee Meeting</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department,
15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on May 3 and 4, 1994, of the following debt management advisory
committee:




Public Securities Association, Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee.




The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on May 3, followed by a charge
by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working session.
On May 4, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations.

The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on May 3 and will be open to the public.
The remaining sessions on May 3 and the committee's reporting session on May 4 will be closed to the public, pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;10(d).

This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. &sect;10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101&hyph;05, that the closed portions of the meeting
are concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest
requires that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice
from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations.
Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major
segments of the financial community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee
under 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;3.

Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b(c)(9)(A).

The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b.

BOARD FOR INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING




<DATE>
TIME AND PLACE: 

10:00 a.m., April 14, 1994.




PLACE: 

American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, NW., 12th Floor, Wohlstetter Room, Washington, DC 20036.




OPEN MEETING: 

The members of the Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) will meet in open session from 10:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M.
to discuss the following matters: (1) approval of the minutes of the most recent BIB open meeting; (2) the Chairman's
report; (3) RFE/RL Interim President's report; (4) new business; and (5) set the date of the next meeting.




CLOSED MEETINGS: 

The open session of the BIB meeting will be followed by a closed meeting of the Board of Directors of RFE/RL, Inc., a nonprofit
private corporation. After completion of this corporate meeting in the afternoon of April 14, the members of the BIB
will reconvene in closed session, if necessary. They would consider the potential use of grant funds to achieve budget
reductions consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States. This BIB meeting would be closed,
therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (1), (2), and (9)(B). Premature disclosure of the information discussed
would likely (1) significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action, including but not limited to
negotiations abroad; (2) disclose matters that would be properly classified to be kept secret in the interests of
foreign policy; and (3) in some instances, relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
