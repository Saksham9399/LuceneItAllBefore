 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model
DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, that would have required repetitive inspections of the passenger service unit (PSU)
printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; and repair or
replacement of the circuit boards or replacement of connectors, if necessary. That proposal was prompted by reports
that certain PSU printed circuit boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. This action revises
the proposed rule by adding a required terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions specified
by this proposed AD are intended to prevent overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power supply connectors,
which could lead to a fire in the PSU.

Discussion


A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
in the 

Federal Register 

on May 25, 1993 (58 FR 30001). That NPRM would have required repetitive visual inspections of the PSU printed circuit
boards and power supply connectors to detect corrosion and evidence of overheating. If any corrosion or evidence
of overheating of the circuit board is detected, the proposed AD would have required the repair or replacement of the
circuit board. If any corrosion or evidence of overheating of the connectors is detected, the proposed AD would have
required replacement of the affected connector. The proposed AD would also have required that all findings of corrosion
or overheating be reported to the manufacturer. That NPRM was prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit
boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. That condition, if not corrected, could result in
overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU.
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the manufacturer has developed a design modification that, if installed, would eliminate
the need for the proposed repetitive inspections. De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin 8&hyph;33&hyph;34,
dated August 10, 1993, that describes installation of Modification 8/1950. Among other things, this modification
entails reworking the PSU to include a new circuit board cover, a modified circuit board mounting, and new wire harnesses.
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has approved the technical content
of this service bulletin and has issued revised Canadian AD No. CF&hyph;93&hyph;01R1, dated December 3, 1993, to
include the modification described in the service bulletin as terminating action for that AD.
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the FAA has determined that the previously proposed AD must be revised to require
the installation of Modification 8/1950 as terminating action for the proposed repetitive inspections of the PSU.
This determination to mandate installation of the modification is based on the FAA's finding that long term continued
operational safety will be better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem, rather than by repetitive
inspections. Long term inspections may not be providing the degree of safety assurance necessary for the transport
airplane fleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerous continual
inspections, has led the FAA to consider placing less emphasis on inspections and more emphasis on design improvements.
The proposed modification requirement is in consonance with these considerations.
Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to
reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment.

Additionally, due consideration has been given to the following comments received in response to the original notice:
Two commenters suggest that issuance of the proposed rule is unnecessary. The commenters contend that the criteria
for issuing a regulation under Federal Aviation Regulations 39.1 (14 CFR 39.1), specifically that the addressed
condition ``is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type,'' has not been met. These commenters
also report that their experience to date does not support the need for issuance of this proposed rule. One of these
commenters suggests that the occurrences of overheated PSU's appear to have been limited to only a few units and, possibly,
to only one non-U.S. operator that is operating in a unique environment. The commenter questions whether there were
any other factors that could have effected the failure of these units, such as missing or improperly installed insulation
blankets, previous maintenance performed on the subject units, etc.
The FAA does not concur with the commenters' suggestion that this rule is unnecessary. Results of the investigation
of the failure scenarios, as performed by de Havilland, revealed that the ingress of moisture through the PSU connectors
is a situation that is not unique to a specific airplane or operator; it is a situation that is common to all Model DHC&hyph;8
airplanes due to their common design. It is true that the one non-U.S. operator that experienced the failure does operate
in a high humidity environment, which may have contributed to creating the worst corrosion/overheat incident reported
to date. Operation of any aircraft in that type of environment increases the chance of moisture ingress that could
lead to corrosion on the printed circuit board or connectors, and to an excessive overheat condition or a potential
fire hazard, should such corrosion go undetected. Although the commenters may not yet have experienced a severe corrosion
problem in their current operating environment, there is nothing restricting Model DHC&hyph;8 aircraft from being
operated in an environment that is more conducive to a moisture ingress and corrosion problem. The FAA concludes that,
based on the design of the Model DHC&hyph;8, the addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes
of this same type.
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 300 hours time-in-service or 30 days (whichever occurs
later) for the initial inspection be extended to at least 600 hours time-in-service. The commenter considers the
proposed compliance time to be too stringent, especially in light of the fact that the PSU circuit board overheat problem
was first reported four years ago, in 1990. The FAA does not concur. The addressed overheating problem is the result
of corrosion of the printed circuit board pins and connector interfaces. Since corrosion is an agent that acts over
time, it is important that operators assess the severity of the corrosion on each applicable airplane as expeditiously
as possible; therefore, the initial inspection interval of 300 hours time-in-service, as proposed, is appropriate.
The FAA does consider that operators who have performed the initial action within the last 12 months should be provided
``credit'' for such action and has revised the proposed initial compliance time to provide such credit.
Two commenters suggest that the proposed repetitive inspection interval of 600 hours time-in-service is too conservative
and should be extended. These commenters request that the interval be changed to at least 12 months. The commenters
state that the addressed corrosion situation results from condensation-induced moisture collecting on the connector;
however, since a water dispersing dielectric grease (a corrosion inhibiting compound) is applied after the initial
inspection, it would serve to protect the area from any further corrosion for some time. One of these commenters considers
that any significant changes in the corrosion status of the circuit board would be insignificant at the proposed 600-hour
interval (which equates to approximately 60 days for most affected operators). One of these commenters indicates
that it already has completed the initial inspection of its fleet of 22 Model DHC&hyph;8's and its findings have revealed
that the corrosion is minor and is not rapidly generated. The FAA concurs with the commenters' request, based on the
information provided. The notice has been revised to specify a repetitive inspection interval of 12 months.
One commenter requests that the proposed rule provide a description of the overheat damage for which inspection is
made. The commenter notes that there is a distinction between normal in-service discoloration and overheat damage.
The circuit board produces heat through its normal operation, which causes a discoloration of the circuit board's
coating. Overheating would cause the board to show exposed fibers and/or melted parts. The FAA concurs with the commenter's
request. A note has been added to the proposed rule to describe the appearance of overheat damage.
One commenter states that the economic impact data presented in the preamble to the NPRM was not completely accurate.
This commenter notes that the number of work hours necessary to perform the proposed inspections is two work hours
per aircraft, not per PSU, as the notice indicated. The FAA acknowledges this correction, and has revised the economic
impact information, below, accordingly.
The FAA estimates that 133 Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.
The proposed inspections would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $14,630, or $110 per airplane, per inspection.
The proposed modification would require approximately 2.25 work hours per PSU to accomplish, at an average labor
cost of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $61.50 per PSU. Each airplane is equipped with between
18 and 26 PSU's. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $185.25 per PSU, or between $3,334.50 and $4,816.50 per airplane.
The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of
the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that the proposed initial inspection has already been accomplished
on approximately 22 airplanes; therefore the future economic impact of this proposed rule is reduced by at least $2,420.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon
Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the control
circuit wiring for the engine thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. This proposal
is prompted by a report that a single dormant electrical fault in the control circuit of the thrust reversers could
cause a thrust reverser to deploy if the pilot selects reverse 
thrust during the approach phase of flight; and by reports that if an asymmetric thrust reverser condition occurs,
the correct rudder bias may not be annunciated before the flight crew applies high reverse thrust. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent adversely affected controllability of the airplane.

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes.
The CAA advises that a single dormant electrical fault in the control circuit of the thrust reversers could cause a
thrust reverser to deploy if the pilot selects reverse thrust during the approach phase of 
flight. The CAA also advises that, currently, a 4-second time delay occurs in the rudder bias annunciation system.
This annunciation system provides a warning to the flight crew that an asymmetric thrust reverser condition may exist.
If an asymmetric thrust reverser condition occurs, and the flight crew does not receive sufficient warning from the
annunciation system, the flight crew may apply high reverse thrust. 

These conditions, if not corrected, could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane. 

Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.78&hyph;9&hyph;3662B, dated 
January 7, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the control circuit wiring of the left and right engine
thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. The modification involves grounding the
normally closed contacts of the deploy microswitch to remove possible dormant shorts, wiring new independently
signalled contacts in series with the power supply to the deploy valve solenoid, separating the wiring for the rudder
bias not inhibited annunciation (warning) from the wiring for the 
uncommanded hydraulic pressure warning to bypass the 4-second time delay, and other miscellaneous wiring changes
to the thrust reverser wiring system. Accomplishment of the modification will improve the integrity of the electrical
control circuits of the thrust reversers by eliminating the possibility of single dormant failures in the thrust
reverser system. Accomplishment of the modification will also correct the status annunciation of the rudder bias
by ensuring that, when an asymmetric thrust reverser condition occurs, the status of the rudder bias system is annunciated
to the flight crew before the power settings for high reverse thrust are applied. The CAA classified this service bulletin
as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the control circuit wiring
for the engine thrust reversers and of the wiring for annunciation of rudder bias status. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
60 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $81,700, or $4,300 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it
may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action proposes to codify a previously announced policy extended to pilots during the initial testing of TCAS,
during the Limited Implementation Plan (LIP) for TCAS, and during the actual implementation of TCAS under the TCAS
Transition Plan (TTP) that permitted pilots to deviate from an air traffic control (ATC) clearance or instruction
in non-emergency situations in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) resolution advisory
(RA). The language contained in current regulations suggests that deviation from an ATC clearance is only authorized
in an emergency situation. This proposal would add the TCAS RA as a reason to deviate from a clearance. This proposal
would require that whenever a pilot deviates from an ATC clearance or instruction, ATC would be advised as soon as practicable.
This proposal is intended to clarify and define pilot reporting requirements in the event a pilot deviates from an
air traffic control clearance or instruction in response to a TCAS resolution advisory.

procedure.


Background


On December 26, 1989, the FAA published a petition for rulemaking received from the Air Transport Association (ATA)
that requested the FAA to amend &sect;91.75(a) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to permit a pilot to deviate
from an ATC clearance when responding to a TCAS RA (54 FR 52951). [Effective August 18, 1990, Part 91 of the FAR was revised
(54 FR 34284; August 18, 1989) to renumber all of its sections. Section 91.75(a) was renumbered as &sect;91.123(a).]
Currently, the FAR's do not provide for any deviation from an ATC clearance or instruction except in an emergency situation.
However, during the initial trial and implementation of TCAS II, the FAA notified pilots that no enforcement action
would be initiated if the pilot deviated from ATC clearances when responding to TCAS RA's. This notification was provided
in a letter signed by the former FAA administrator James B. Busey. The letter was published as appendix C to the TCAS
Transition Program (TTP) Project Management Plan, dated August 1, 1990. The FAA also provided procedural guidance,
including ATC communication requirements, in Advisory Circular 120&hyph;55, ``Air Carrier Operational Approval
and Use of TCAS II'' dated October 23, 1991, and later amended as AC 120&hyph;55A dated August 27, 1993. The policy and
guidance proved successful during the testing and implementation of TCAS II.
The ATA petition states that TCAS is an advisory system and not an emergency system. The ATA felt that pilots should
be able to comply with a TCAS RA without exercising emergency authority. The ATA petition mirrors current FAA policy
and guidance for use of TCAS II. The petition drew no negative comments and one positive comment, from the Airline Pilots
Association (ALPA), in support of the proposal.
Section 91.123 of the FAR states, in pertinent part, that each pilot in command who, in an emergency, deviates from
an ATC clearance or instruction shall notify ATC of that deviation as soon as possible. This provision could be interpreted
to mean that deviations for non-emergency related reasons are not authorized.
TCAS II is now installed on approximately 6000 aircraft worldwide. Over the past 3 years, more than 15 million flight
hours of operational experience have been accumulated.


TCAS Overview


TCAS equipment in an airplane interrogates the ATC transponders of other aircraft nearby. By computer analysis of
the replies, TCAS equipment determines which transponder-equipped aircraft are potential collision hazards and
provides appropriate advisory information to the flight crew. If a TCAS-equipped airplane interrogates an aircraft
that is equipped with a Mode A transponder, range and azimuth information will be provided to the TCAS-equipped aircraft.
If the interrogated aircraft is equipped with an altitude encoding transponder (Mode C or Mode S), then relative altitude
information will be provided in addition to range and azimuth. TCAS equipment cannot detect the presence of an aircraft
that is not equipped with a transponder.
TCAS equipment performs proximity tests on each detected target. If the path of a target is projected to pass within
certain horizontal and vertical distance criteria, then that target is declared an intruder. An intruder that is
determined to pose an even greater risk of collision is declared a threat. When a threat is declared, TCAS equipment
will determine the appropriate direction that the TCAS-equipped aircraft must move (climb or descent) and the vertical
rate that must be maintained to achieve separation from the threat.
There are two classes of advisories provided by TCAS equipment. The first class, traffic advisories (TA's), provides
supplemental information to the pilot that aids in visual detection of other aircraft. TA's include the range, bearing,
and, if the intruder has altitude-reporting equipment, the altitude of the intruding aircraft relative to the TCAS-equipped
aircraft. TA's without altitude may also be provided from non-altitude reporting transponder-equipped intruders.
The second class of advisories, resolution advisories (RA's), indicates the vertical direction and rate that must
be achieved to prevent insufficient separation.
TCAS I equipment provides TA's that only assist the pilot in visually detecting an intruder aircraft. TCAS II equipment
provides TA's and RA's only in the vertical plane. TCAS III, which is still under development, will provide TA's and
RA's in both the vertical and horizontal planes.


Related Agency Actions


On January 10, 1989, the FAA published a final rule (54 FR 940), the ``TCAS rule,'' which required airplanes having
more than 30 passenger seats and operated under parts 121, 125, or 129 to be equipped with TCAS II by December 30, 1991.
The TCAS rule also required airplanes having 10 to 30 passenger seats and operated under parts 129 or 135 to be equipped
with TCAS I by February 9, 1995.

<DOCNO> FR940429-1-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940429-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On April 9, 1990, the FAA amended the TCAS rule by revising the schedule for the installation of TCAS II equipment in
airplanes having more than 30 passenger seats (55 FR 13242). Operators of airplanes having more than 30 passenger
seats and operated under part 121 are required to install TCAS II equipment in accordance with a phased-in schedule
so that 100% of an operator's covered airplanes will have TCAS II equipment by December 30, 1993. Operations conducted
under parts 125 or 129 with airplanes having more than 30 passenger seats are also required to install TCAS II equipment
by December 30, 1993.



The Proposal



The FAA believes that most TCAS RA's will involve changes in the rate of descent or climb in order to mitigate potential
collision hazards. Such TCAS RA's routinely will not necessitate a pilot deviating from an ATC clearance or instruction.
The issue of advising ATC of the receipt of or compliance with a TCAS RA that does not involve a deviation from a clearance
or instruction is a matter of pilot judgment and discretion.

The FAA also has determined that the majority of deviations from ATC clearances or instructions in response to TCAS
RA's will be appropriate and necessary to resolve potential collision hazards with other transponder-equipped
aircraft. In such cases, pilots executing the appropriate maneuvers are expected to advise ATC of the deviations
as soon as possible.

The current language of &sect;91.123(c) provides that a pilot who deviates from an ATC clearance or instruction,
in an emergency, shall notify ATC as soon as possible. If a pilot deviates from an assigned altitude in response to a
TCAS RA, but does not believe that an emergency exists, that pilot may determine, based on current &sect;91.123(c),
that an advisory to ATC is not required. The proposal would specifically state that a report to ATC is required.

Air traffic controllers base their control and traffic management decisions on the expectation that pilots will
comply with ATC-assigned routes, altitudes, and other clearances and instructions. If a pilot must deviate from
an ATC clearance or instruction, the controller mut be given timely notification of that deviation so that appropriate
instructions and/or advisories can be issued to ensure a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic. By advising
ATC as soon as possible after a deviation, the controller can evaluate the situation, determine the most appropriate
and safe course of action, and issue alternate instructions if necessary.

The FAA has concluded that this proposed rule is necessary to codify existing policy for pilots to notify ATC as soon
as possible after any deviation from an ATC clearance or instruction in response to a TCAS RA, whether that deviation
was emergency-related or not. Further, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule will not add or change any notification
or reporting requirements for deviations that are necessary to resolve potential or imminent collision hazards.
The FAA has always intended that notification to ATC of a deviation from a clearance or instruction is necessary and
required, whether that deviation is emergency-related or not. This action serves only to reinforce and codify that
intention.

Accordingly, the FAA proposes to amend &sect;91.123 of the FAR to authorize deviations from an ATC clearance or instruction
when responding to a TCAS RA. In addition, pilots would be required to advise ATC of the TCAS RA deviation from an ATC
clearance or instruction whether emergency-related or not.



Economic Evaluation



The FAA has determined that this NPRM is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated benefits and costs associated with this NPRM are summarized below.
(A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full evaluation in the docket for this NPRM). The agency
has determined that this proposed rule would be cost-beneficial because it imposes no costs and would promote air
safety. There would not be any changes in notification or reporting requirements for deviations from ATC clearances
that are necessary to avoid potential collision hazards. The proposal would clarify and codify existing policy and
guidance requirements that pilots who deviate from their assigned altitudes in response to a TCAS resolution advisory
provide timely notice of that deviation to air traffic control in both non-emergency situations and emergency situations.
Such notification would give controllers an opportunity to resolve any conflicts resulting from a TCAS II- equipped
aircraft being at other than the assigned altitude.

International Trade Impact Statement




This proposed rule would not impose a competitive disadvantage to either U.S. air carriers doing business abroad
or foreign air carriers doing business in the United States. This assessment is based on the fact that this proposed
rule would not impose additional costs on either U.S. or foreign air carriers.




Regulatory Flexibility Determination



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule would not
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. This assessment
is based on the fact that the proposed rule would not impose any additional cost on aircraft operators.



Paperwork Reduction Act



There are no requirements for information collection associated with this proposed rule that would require approval
from the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511).




Federalism Implications




The regulation proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposed rule does
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations



In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO), it is FAA policy
to comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined
that this NPRM complies with the ICAO SARP.



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This proposed regulation is not considered significant under
DOT Order 2100.5, Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). In addition, the FAA certifies that this
proposed regulation, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A regulatory evaluation of the NPRM,
including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket. A copy

27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM (58 FR 57942) on the indicators of minimum compliance with the evaluation
standards under the Centers for Independent Living Program (Indicators NPRM). The Indicators NPRM notified the
public of the Nomenclature NPRM and advised the public to direct their comments on the proposed nomenclature change
to the Nomenclature NPRM. 



The Secretary received 37 comments on the Nomenclature NPRM expressing a wide range of points of view about the proposed
change. Commenters favoring the change generally expressed the view that the term ``significant'' is less pejorative
than ``severe'' in referring to an individual's disability. These comments were generally received from commenters
with an interest in the Independent Living Services and Centers for Independent Living programs authorized by Title
VII of the Act. Commenters opposing the change raised several issues. Some suggested that the change is technically
not accurate and that a change in meaning would result despite departmental assurances to the contrary. Others suggested
that the change would be confusing and burdensome to implement and that the change should be made through legislation
rather than through rulemaking. These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the Vocational
Rehabilitation Services programs authorized by Title I of the Act. 

The Secretary received 102 comments on the ``Indicators NPRM,'' of which 56 included comments on the proposed change
of the term ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Of these 56 comments, only 4 expressed concern with the proposed change.
Approximately 28 commenters specifically approved of the proposed change, and 24 commenters used the new terminology
in their own comments, implicitly indicating their approval of the proposed change. That is, these 24 commenters
used the term ``significant'' instead of the term ``severe'' in their comments, even though they did not specifically
approve of the proposed change. The remaining 50 commenters expressed no views on the proposed change and did not use
either of the terms ``severe'' or ``significant'' in their comments. 

Based on the favorable support for the nomenclature change received from the independent living community, the Secretary
plans to propose the change in program regulations implementing Title VII of the Act. The proposed Title VII regulations
would implement changes to the Act made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) and the
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;73). The Secretary expects to publish these proposed regulations
shortly. The Secretary does not plan to make the nomenclature change in any other program regulations.
